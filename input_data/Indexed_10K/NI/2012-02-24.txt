In addition, the relative contributions to profitability by each segment, and the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements relating thereto, may change over time. CONSOLIDATED REVIEW Executive Summary NiSource is an energy holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged in the transmission, storage and distribution of natural gas in the high demand energy corridor stretching from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest to New England and the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Indiana. NiSource generates most of its operating income through these rate regulated businesses. A significant portion of NiSources operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, net revenues from gas sales are more significant, and during the cooling season, which is primarily from June through September, net revenues from electric sales and transportation services are more significant than in other months. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $303.8 million, or $1.08 per basic share, compared to $285.2 million, or $1.03 per basic share for the same period in 2010. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Increases in income from continuing operations were due primarily to the following items: NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues increased $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue as a result of new growth projects. See below for a discussion of growth projects at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Additionally, there was an increase due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. See below for a discussion of commercial and regulatory initiatives and the expected impact on NiSource. Depreciation and amortization decreased $58.9 million primarily as a result of new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana from the implementation of the gas rate case. These rates were put into effect at the end of 2010. Rates for 2012 will be comparable to 2011. Loss on early extinguishment of long term debt decreased $42.8 million in 2011 due to the differences in early redemption fees, primarily attributable to early redemption premiums and unamortized discounts and fees, related to tender offers finalized in the fourth quarter of both 2011 and 2010. See below for a discussion of NiSources financial management of the balance sheet for more information. Increases in income from continuing operations were partially offset due to the following items: Operation and maintenance expense increased $59.2 million primarily related to additional pension contributions at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. NiSource expects to experience reduced pension costs in 2012 as a result of this contribution. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The effective tax rate increased to 35.0% compared to 32.2% for the comparable period last year. The increase is due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carryforward, were required to be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction in income tax expense as a result of a rate case settlement by Columbia of Pennsylvania that required it to flow through certain tax benefits to customers in current rates. NiSource expects to experience benefits related to this issue until January 2014. These factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of Results of Operations and Results and Discussion of Segment Operations. Four Point Platform for Growth NiSources four key initiatives to build a platform for long term, sustainable growth continue to comprise commercial and regulatory initiatives; commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business; financial management of the balance sheet; and process and expense management. Commercial and Regulatory Initiatives Rate Development and Other Regulatory Matters. NiSource is moving forward with regulatory initiatives across several gas distribution company markets, at Northern Indiana, and at Columbia Gulf. Whether through full rate case filings or other approaches, NiSources goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it addresses changing customer conservation patterns, develops more contemporary pricing structures, and embarks on long term investment programs to enhance its infrastructure. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On December 28, 2011, the IURC issued an Order approving Northern Indianas proposed gas energy efficiency programs and budgets, including a conservation program and recovery of all start up and deferred costs. A three year budget of $42.4 million for these programs was approved. In its Order the IURC recognized that Northern Indiana was one of two utilities in the state in a position to integrate its gas and electric energy efficiency programs throughout its service territory footprint. Northern Indiana is presently working through implementation plans. On June 1, 2011, Columbia of Virginia filed an application for approval of an infrastructure tracking mechanism pursuant to the Steps to Advance Virginias Energy (SAVE) Plan Act. Columbia of Virginias SAVE Plan provides for recovery of costs associated with the accelerated replacement of certain facilities designed to improve system safety or reliability through a rate rider. The proposed replacement program would result in investments of $20 million per year from 2012 through 2016, as well as covering $2.9 million in investment occurring in 2011. The Staff of the VSCC filed responsive testimony on August 22, 2011 and a public hearing was held on September 7, 2011. The Hearing Examiner issued a Report on October 6, 2011 recommending approval of the SAVE Plan. The VSCC issued an Order on November 28, 2011 approving the SAVE Plan and the associated rider effective December 30, 2011. On January 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC, seeking a revenue increase of approximately $37.8 million annually. The parties to the case jointly filed a petition for approval of a partial settlement on July 1, 2011. The partial settlement resolved all issues except residential rate design and a challenge to the structure of one of Columbia of Pennsylvanias customer programs. The settlement provides for an annual revenue increase of $17 million. The Pennsylvania PUC issued an order on October 14, 2011 approving the annual revenue increase of $17 million. New rates went into effect on October 18, 2011. The Pennsylvania PUCs ruling increased the minimum residential customer charge from $12.25 to $18.73, which includes an allowance for 20 Ccf of distribution charges. However, the customer pays for gas commodity on all usage. On November 30, 2010, Columbia of Ohio filed a notice of intent to file an application to adjust rates associated with Rider IRP and Rider DSM. On February 28, 2011, Columbia of Ohio filed its application to adjust rates associated with the IRP and DSM Riders. The DSM Rider tracks and recovers costs associated with Columbia of Ohios energy efficiency and conservation programs. The application sought to increase the annual revenue from the riders by approximately $24 million. On April 7, 2011, the parties filed a stipulation that settled this case, which was approved as filed by the PUCO on April 27, 2011. The Order allowed Columbia of Ohio to increase its annual revenues by approximately $24 million effective May 1, 2011. On September 9, 2011, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with PUCO to continue and expand its DSM program. In its application, Columbia of Ohio proposed to spend $20 million annually (adjusted for inflation) on weatherization programs for residential and commercial customers for calendar years 2012 through 2016. Columbia of Ohio will continue to recover program expenses through Rider DSM and has proposed a shared savings incentive not to exceed $3.9 million over the five year program. By Order dated December 14, 2011, the PUCO approved a stipulation filed in the case. On October 28, 2010, Columbia Gulf filed a rate case with the FERC, proposing a rate increase and tariff changes. Among other things, the filing proposed a revenue increase of approximately $50 million to cover increases in the cost of services, which included adjustments for operation and maintenance expenses, capital investments, adjustments to depreciation rates and expense, rate of return, and increased federal, state and local taxes. On November 30, 2010, the FERC issued an Order allowing new rates to become effective by May 2011, subject to refund. Columbia Gulf placed new rates into effect, subject to refund, on May 1, 2011. Columbia Gulf and the active parties to the case negotiated a settlement, which was filed with the FERC on September 9, 2011. On September 30, 2011, the Chief Judge severed the issues relating to a contesting party for separate hearing and decision. On October 4, 2011, the Presiding Administrative Law Judge certified the settlement agreement as uncontested to the FERC with severance of the contesting party from the settlement. On November 1, 2011, Columbia Gulf began billing interim rates to customers. On December 1, 2011, the FERC issued an Order approving the settlement without change. The key elements of the settlement, which was a black box agreement, include: (1) increased base rate to $0.1520 per Dth and (2) establishing a postage stamp rate design. No protests to the Order were filed and therefore, pursuant to the Settlement, the order became final on January 1, 2012 which made the settlement effective on February 1, 2012. On February 2, 2012, the Presiding Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision granting a joint motion terminating the remaining litigation with the contesting party and allowing it to become a settling party. Refunds of approximately $16 million, accrued as of December 31, 2011, are to be issued before the end of March 2012. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 18, 2011, Northern Indiana filed with the IURC a settlement in its 2010 Electric Rate Case with the OUCC, Northern Indiana Industrial Group, NLMK Indiana and Indiana Municipal Utilities Group. The settlement agreement limited the proposed base rate impact to the residential customer class to a 4.5% increase. The parties have also agreed to a rate of return of 6.98% based upon a 10.2% return on equity. The settlement also resolves all pending issues related to compliance with the August 25, 2010 Order in the 2008 Electric Rate Case. On December 21, 2011, the IURC issued an Order approving the Settlement Agreement as filed, and new electric base rates became effective on December 27, 2011. On January 20, 2012, the City of Hammond filed an appeal of the IURCs December 21, 2011 Order. That appeal is pending. On March 22, 2011, Northern Indiana filed a petition with the IURC for a certificate of public convenience and necessity and associated relief for the construction of additional environmental projects required to comply with the NOV consent decree lodged in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana on January 13, 2011. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, for additional information. This petition has since been trifurcated into three separate phases. In terms of Phase I, the evidentiary hearing was held at the IURC on August 31, 2011 addressing the relief regarding (i) the construction of a FGD unit at R.M. Schahfer Generating Station Unit 15 and (ii) a cost estimate increase for the projects approved by the December 29, 2010 Order, which included estimates for a FGD unit at R.M. Schahfer Generating Station Unit 14 and associated common facilities for Units 14 and 15. On December 28, 2011, the IURC issued an order for the Phase I projects estimated to cost $500 million and granting the requested ratemaking and accounting relief associated with these Phase I projects. On November 9, 2011, Northern Indiana filed with the IURC a stipulation and settlement agreement with the OUCC and the Industrial Group resolving all issues regarding the Phase II projects, which includes all remaining projects with the exception of those projects related to Michigan City Generating Station Unit 12. The motion also requested the establishment of and a procedural schedule for a new Phase III for the Unit 12 projects. The evidentiary hearing was held for the Phase II projects at the IURC on December 14, 2011. On February 15, 2012, the IURC approved the stipulation and settlement agreement. The establishment of a Phase III in this proceeding occurred in response to the fact that on October 20, 2011 and October 21, 2011, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, respectively, filed testimony in opposition of the proposed construction of a FGD unit on Michigan City Generating Station Unit 12. On February 14, 2012, the IURC set a procedural schedule for the Phase III projects. As part of a multi state effort to strengthen the electric transmission system serving the Midwest, Northern Indiana anticipates making an investment in a new, 100 mile, 345 kilovolt transmission project in northern Indiana. The project, a major new transmission system improvement reviewed and authorized by the MISO, is scheduled to be in service during the latter part of the decade. Northern Indiana has also been identified by the MISO as one of two Transmission Owners to invest in another project. On February 8, 2012, Pioneer Transmission, LLC filed a complaint with the FERC, seeking to obtain 100% of the investment rights in this second project. Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of regulatory matters. Commercial Growth and Expansion of the Gas Transmission and Storage Business During 2011, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations placed into service strategic growth projects, primarily serving the Marcellus Shale production area. Below is a discussion of these projects as well as projects that are currently on going. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter of 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Financial Management of the Balance Sheet NiSource remains committed to maintaining its liquidity position through management of capital spending, working capital and operational requirements, and its financing needs. NiSource has executed on its plan by taking the following actions: On November 23, 2011, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 4.45% senior unsecured notes that mature December 1, 2021 and $250.0 million of 5.80% senior unsecured notes that mature February 1, 2042. On November 14, 2011, NiSource Finance commenced a cash tender offer for up to $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 and 6.15% notes due 2013. A condition of the offering was that all validly tendered 2016 notes would be accepted for purchase before any 2013 notes were accepted. On December 13, 2011, NiSource Finance announced that approximately $125.3 million of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 were validly tendered and accepted for purchase. In addition, approximately $228.7 million of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.15% notes due 2013 were validly tendered, of which $124.7 million were accepted for purchase. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 470, Debt, NiSource Finance determined the debt issued on November 23, 2011, was substantially different from the tendered notes, and therefore the transaction qualified as a debt extinguishment. NiSource Finance recorded a $53.9 million loss on early extinguishment of long term debt, primarily attributable to early redemption premiums and unamortized discounts and fees. During July 2011, Northern Indiana redeemed $18.7 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.30%. On June 10, 2011, NiSource Finance issued $400.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes that mature June 15, 2041. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility has a termination date of March 3, 2015 and replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility, which would have expired during July 2011. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Process and Expense Management Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on process and expense management. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Ethics and Controls NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the Companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Results of Operations The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource as discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $303.8 million, or $1.08 per basic share, compared to $285.2 million, or $1.03 per basic share in 2010. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $229.8 million, or $0.84 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2011 net income of $299.1 million, or $1.06 per basic share, 2010 net income of $282.6 million, or $1.02 per basic share, and 2009 net income of $217.0 million, or $0.79 per basic share. Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations. A decrease in operating expenses of $40.4 million for the 2011 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs. In the 2010 period, a decrease in operating expenses of $7.6 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These changes from 2010 to 2011 were largely attributable to fluctuations in recoveries associated with low income assistance programs. Immaterial Restatement As discussed further below, NiSource is making certain correcting adjustments to its historical financial statements for the quarters of 2011 and 2010 and for the years of 2010 and 2009, as well as to other selected financial data for the years 2008 and 2007. NiSource does not believe these corrections are material individually or in the aggregate to its financial condition or its financial results for any reported period. Refer to the tables below for the effects of these corrections on prior periods. Deferred revenue In the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource identified a deferred revenue regulatory asset of $25.2 million that was not recoverable. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease in electric revenue of $7.4 million and an increase of $1.0 million, respectively, with an offset to deferred revenue regulatory assets. The remaining decrease in electric revenue of $18.2 million was corrected prior to 2009. The correction reduced electric revenue by a total of $0.6 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011. There was no impact to customers as a result of this correction. Environmental asset recovery NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $3.4 million in operation and maintenance expense and $4.6 million in depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory environmental asset that was not recoverable, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase to expense of $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $5.6 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB over reimbursement In the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource identified an over reimbursement of $8.0 million received by NiSource from an insurer related to other post employment benefits. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, with an offset to other accruals. The remaining increase in expense of $5.4 million was corrected prior to 2009. The correction increased expense by a total of $0.5 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Environmental accrual In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded an out of period reduction to expense of $6.0 million to reduce an environmental liability that was incorrectly recorded in a prior year. To reverse the liability in the proper periods, NiSource recorded an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $6.0 million in 2010 and a decrease of $0.2 million in 2009 with an offset to legal and environmental accruals. The remaining decrease to expense of $5.8 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB regulatory asset NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $2.4 million in operation and maintenance expense in the second quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory asset related to OPEB that was not probable of recovery, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease to operation and maintenance expense of $0.2 million and an increase of $0.1 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $2.3 million was corrected prior to 2009. Healthcare claims In 2008, NiSource recorded an out of period credit of $13.3 million to correct the allocation of healthcare claims expense to active employees and retired participants in its other post employment benefits. As this error arose in 2007, NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2008 and 2007 for the impact of this error. Unbilled revenue In 2007, NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $25.5 million to correct an error that arose in prior years in its unbilled electric and gas revenue calculation. NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2007 for the impact of this error.

Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, were $3,462.7 million, a $22.2 million increase compared with 2010. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $56.4 million and increased Electric Operations net revenues of $7.6 million partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $21.3 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues increased primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during 2010. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were $3,440.5 million, a $106.9 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $113.1 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues were higher primarily as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, operating revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,572.2 million in 2011, an increase of $22.4 million from the comparable 2010 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of $59.2 million, higher impairment charges of $14.8 million and increased other taxes of $7.3 million. The increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of $14.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to Lake Erie Land. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case. Operating expenses were $2,549.8 million in 2010, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable 2009 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $36.0 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, and lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $14.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $0.4 million compared with 2010. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010 compared to $16.0 million in 2009. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2011 reduced income $438.0 million compared to a reduction of $485.2 million in 2010. The increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $42.8 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Also, there was a decrease in interest expense of $15.5 million. Interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in November 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in December 2010 and a long term debt maturity of $681.8 million in November 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in November 2010, the issuance of $500.0 million of long term debt in November 2011, $400.0 million in June 2011 and $250.0 million in December 2010, and higher average short term borrowings and rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.1 million in other, net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year. Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the Companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the Companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 35.0%, 32.2%, and 41.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2.8% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording $6.8 million in tax expense in the second quarter, and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. The effect of the rate settlements also was the primary 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2009, 2010 and 2011, and estimates for 2012. 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 Gas Distribution Operations $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 431.6 301.5 302.0 287.4 Electric Operations 413.6 267.7 190.3 162.6 Corporate and Other Operations 21.8 22.0 9.6 5.4 Total $ 1,400.0 $ 1,130.6 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 For 2012, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,400.0 million, which is $269.4 million higher than the 2011 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment.

Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Increases in income from continuing operations were due primarily to the following items: NiSources Gas Transmission and Storage Operations net revenues increased $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue as a result of new growth projects. See below for a discussion of growth projects at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. Additionally, there was an increase due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. See below for a discussion of commercial and regulatory initiatives and the expected impact on NiSource. Depreciation and amortization decreased $58.9 million primarily as a result of new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana from the implementation of the gas rate case. These rates were put into effect at the end of 2010. Rates for 2012 will be comparable to 2011. Loss on early extinguishment of long term debt decreased $42.8 million in 2011 due to the differences in early redemption fees, primarily attributable to early redemption premiums and unamortized discounts and fees, related to tender offers finalized in the fourth quarter of both 2011 and 2010. See below for a discussion of NiSources financial management of the balance sheet for more information. Increases in income from continuing operations were partially offset due to the following items: Operation and maintenance expense increased $59.2 million primarily related to additional pension contributions at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. NiSource expects to experience reduced pension costs in 2012 as a result of this contribution. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The effective tax rate increased to 35.0% compared to 32.2% for the comparable period last year. The increase is due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carryforward, were required to be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction in income tax expense as a result of a rate case settlement by Columbia of Pennsylvania that required it to flow through certain tax benefits to customers in current rates. NiSource expects to experience benefits related to this issue until January 2014. These factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of Results of Operations and Results and Discussion of Segment Operations. Four Point Platform for Growth NiSources four key initiatives to build a platform for long term, sustainable growth continue to comprise commercial and regulatory initiatives; commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business; financial management of the balance sheet; and process and expense management. Commercial and Regulatory Initiatives Rate Development and Other Regulatory Matters. NiSource is moving forward with regulatory initiatives across several gas distribution company markets, at Northern Indiana, and at Columbia Gulf. Whether through full rate case filings or other approaches, NiSources goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it addresses changing customer conservation patterns, develops more contemporary pricing structures, and embarks on long term investment programs to enhance its infrastructure. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On December 28, 2011, the IURC issued an Order approving Northern Indianas proposed gas energy efficiency programs and budgets, including a conservation program and recovery of all start up and deferred costs. A three year budget of $42.4 million for these programs was approved. In its Order the IURC recognized that Northern Indiana was one of two utilities in the state in a position to integrate its gas and electric energy efficiency programs throughout its service territory footprint. Northern Indiana is presently working through implementation plans. On June 1, 2011, Columbia of Virginia filed an application for approval of an infrastructure tracking mechanism pursuant to the Steps to Advance Virginias Energy (SAVE) Plan Act. Columbia of Virginias SAVE Plan provides for recovery of costs associated with the accelerated replacement of certain facilities designed to improve system safety or reliability through a rate rider. The proposed replacement program would result in investments of $20 million per year from 2012 through 2016, as well as covering $2.9 million in investment occurring in 2011. The Staff of the VSCC filed responsive testimony on August 22, 2011 and a public hearing was held on September 7, 2011. The Hearing Examiner issued a Report on October 6, 2011 recommending approval of the SAVE Plan. The VSCC issued an Order on November 28, 2011 approving the SAVE Plan and the associated rider effective December 30, 2011. On January 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC, seeking a revenue increase of approximately $37.8 million annually. The parties to the case jointly filed a petition for approval of a partial settlement on July 1, 2011. The partial settlement resolved all issues except residential rate design and a challenge to the structure of one of Columbia of Pennsylvanias customer programs. The settlement provides for an annual revenue increase of $17 million. The Pennsylvania PUC issued an order on October 14, 2011 approving the annual revenue increase of $17 million. New rates went into effect on October 18, 2011. The Pennsylvania PUCs ruling increased the minimum residential customer charge from $12.25 to $18.73, which includes an allowance for 20 Ccf of distribution charges. However, the customer pays for gas commodity on all usage. On November 30, 2010, Columbia of Ohio filed a notice of intent to file an application to adjust rates associated with Rider IRP and Rider DSM. On February 28, 2011, Columbia of Ohio filed its application to adjust rates associated with the IRP and DSM Riders. The DSM Rider tracks and recovers costs associated with Columbia of Ohios energy efficiency and conservation programs. The application sought to increase the annual revenue from the riders by approximately $24 million. On April 7, 2011, the parties filed a stipulation that settled this case, which was approved as filed by the PUCO on April 27, 2011. The Order allowed Columbia of Ohio to increase its annual revenues by approximately $24 million effective May 1, 2011. On September 9, 2011, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with PUCO to continue and expand its DSM program. In its application, Columbia of Ohio proposed to spend $20 million annually (adjusted for inflation) on weatherization programs for residential and commercial customers for calendar years 2012 through 2016. Columbia of Ohio will continue to recover program expenses through Rider DSM and has proposed a shared savings incentive not to exceed $3.9 million over the five year program. By Order dated December 14, 2011, the PUCO approved a stipulation filed in the case. On October 28, 2010, Columbia Gulf filed a rate case with the FERC, proposing a rate increase and tariff changes. Among other things, the filing proposed a revenue increase of approximately $50 million to cover increases in the cost of services, which included adjustments for operation and maintenance expenses, capital investments, adjustments to depreciation rates and expense, rate of return, and increased federal, state and local taxes. On November 30, 2010, the FERC issued an Order allowing new rates to become effective by May 2011, subject to refund. Columbia Gulf placed new rates into effect, subject to refund, on May 1, 2011. Columbia Gulf and the active parties to the case negotiated a settlement, which was filed with the FERC on September 9, 2011. On September 30, 2011, the Chief Judge severed the issues relating to a contesting party for separate hearing and decision. On October 4, 2011, the Presiding Administrative Law Judge certified the settlement agreement as uncontested to the FERC with severance of the contesting party from the settlement. On November 1, 2011, Columbia Gulf began billing interim rates to customers. On December 1, 2011, the FERC issued an Order approving the settlement without change. The key elements of the settlement, which was a black box agreement, include: (1) increased base rate to $0.1520 per Dth and (2) establishing a postage stamp rate design. No protests to the Order were filed and therefore, pursuant to the Settlement, the order became final on January 1, 2012 which made the settlement effective on February 1, 2012. On February 2, 2012, the Presiding Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision granting a joint motion terminating the remaining litigation with the contesting party and allowing it to become a settling party. Refunds of approximately $16 million, accrued as of December 31, 2011, are to be issued before the end of March 2012. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 18, 2011, Northern Indiana filed with the IURC a settlement in its 2010 Electric Rate Case with the OUCC, Northern Indiana Industrial Group, NLMK Indiana and Indiana Municipal Utilities Group. The settlement agreement limited the proposed base rate impact to the residential customer class to a 4.5% increase. The parties have also agreed to a rate of return of 6.98% based upon a 10.2% return on equity. The settlement also resolves all pending issues related to compliance with the August 25, 2010 Order in the 2008 Electric Rate Case. On December 21, 2011, the IURC issued an Order approving the Settlement Agreement as filed, and new electric base rates became effective on December 27, 2011. On January 20, 2012, the City of Hammond filed an appeal of the IURCs December 21, 2011 Order. That appeal is pending. On March 22, 2011, Northern Indiana filed a petition with the IURC for a certificate of public convenience and necessity and associated relief for the construction of additional environmental projects required to comply with the NOV consent decree lodged in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana on January 13, 2011. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, for additional information. This petition has since been trifurcated into three separate phases. In terms of Phase I, the evidentiary hearing was held at the IURC on August 31, 2011 addressing the relief regarding (i) the construction of a FGD unit at R.M. Schahfer Generating Station Unit 15 and (ii) a cost estimate increase for the projects approved by the December 29, 2010 Order, which included estimates for a FGD unit at R.M. Schahfer Generating Station Unit 14 and associated common facilities for Units 14 and 15. On December 28, 2011, the IURC issued an order for the Phase I projects estimated to cost $500 million and granting the requested ratemaking and accounting relief associated with these Phase I projects. On November 9, 2011, Northern Indiana filed with the IURC a stipulation and settlement agreement with the OUCC and the Industrial Group resolving all issues regarding the Phase II projects, which includes all remaining projects with the exception of those projects related to Michigan City Generating Station Unit 12. The motion also requested the establishment of and a procedural schedule for a new Phase III for the Unit 12 projects. The evidentiary hearing was held for the Phase II projects at the IURC on December 14, 2011. On February 15, 2012, the IURC approved the stipulation and settlement agreement. The establishment of a Phase III in this proceeding occurred in response to the fact that on October 20, 2011 and October 21, 2011, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, respectively, filed testimony in opposition of the proposed construction of a FGD unit on Michigan City Generating Station Unit 12. On February 14, 2012, the IURC set a procedural schedule for the Phase III projects. As part of a multi state effort to strengthen the electric transmission system serving the Midwest, Northern Indiana anticipates making an investment in a new, 100 mile, 345 kilovolt transmission project in northern Indiana. The project, a major new transmission system improvement reviewed and authorized by the MISO, is scheduled to be in service during the latter part of the decade. Northern Indiana has also been identified by the MISO as one of two Transmission Owners to invest in another project. On February 8, 2012, Pioneer Transmission, LLC filed a complaint with the FERC, seeking to obtain 100% of the investment rights in this second project. Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of regulatory matters. Commercial Growth and Expansion of the Gas Transmission and Storage Business During 2011, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations placed into service strategic growth projects, primarily serving the Marcellus Shale production area. Below is a discussion of these projects as well as projects that are currently on going. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter of 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Financial Management of the Balance Sheet NiSource remains committed to maintaining its liquidity position through management of capital spending, working capital and operational requirements, and its financing needs. NiSource has executed on its plan by taking the following actions: On November 23, 2011, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 4.45% senior unsecured notes that mature December 1, 2021 and $250.0 million of 5.80% senior unsecured notes that mature February 1, 2042. On November 14, 2011, NiSource Finance commenced a cash tender offer for up to $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 and 6.15% notes due 2013. A condition of the offering was that all validly tendered 2016 notes would be accepted for purchase before any 2013 notes were accepted. On December 13, 2011, NiSource Finance announced that approximately $125.3 million of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 were validly tendered and accepted for purchase. In addition, approximately $228.7 million of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.15% notes due 2013 were validly tendered, of which $124.7 million were accepted for purchase. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 470, Debt, NiSource Finance determined the debt issued on November 23, 2011, was substantially different from the tendered notes, and therefore the transaction qualified as a debt extinguishment. NiSource Finance recorded a $53.9 million loss on early extinguishment of long term debt, primarily attributable to early redemption premiums and unamortized discounts and fees. During July 2011, Northern Indiana redeemed $18.7 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.30%. On June 10, 2011, NiSource Finance issued $400.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes that mature June 15, 2041. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility has a termination date of March 3, 2015 and replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility, which would have expired during July 2011. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Process and Expense Management Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on process and expense management. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Ethics and Controls NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the Companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Results of Operations The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource as discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $303.8 million, or $1.08 per basic share, compared to $285.2 million, or $1.03 per basic share in 2010. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $229.8 million, or $0.84 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2011 net income of $299.1 million, or $1.06 per basic share, 2010 net income of $282.6 million, or $1.02 per basic share, and 2009 net income of $217.0 million, or $0.79 per basic share. Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations. A decrease in operating expenses of $40.4 million for the 2011 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs. In the 2010 period, a decrease in operating expenses of $7.6 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These changes from 2010 to 2011 were largely attributable to fluctuations in recoveries associated with low income assistance programs. Immaterial Restatement As discussed further below, NiSource is making certain correcting adjustments to its historical financial statements for the quarters of 2011 and 2010 and for the years of 2010 and 2009, as well as to other selected financial data for the years 2008 and 2007. NiSource does not believe these corrections are material individually or in the aggregate to its financial condition or its financial results for any reported period. Refer to the tables below for the effects of these corrections on prior periods. Deferred revenue In the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource identified a deferred revenue regulatory asset of $25.2 million that was not recoverable. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease in electric revenue of $7.4 million and an increase of $1.0 million, respectively, with an offset to deferred revenue regulatory assets. The remaining decrease in electric revenue of $18.2 million was corrected prior to 2009. The correction reduced electric revenue by a total of $0.6 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011. There was no impact to customers as a result of this correction. Environmental asset recovery NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $3.4 million in operation and maintenance expense and $4.6 million in depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory environmental asset that was not recoverable, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase to expense of $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $5.6 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB over reimbursement In the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource identified an over reimbursement of $8.0 million received by NiSource from an insurer related to other post employment benefits. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, with an offset to other accruals. The remaining increase in expense of $5.4 million was corrected prior to 2009. The correction increased expense by a total of $0.5 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Environmental accrual In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded an out of period reduction to expense of $6.0 million to reduce an environmental liability that was incorrectly recorded in a prior year. To reverse the liability in the proper periods, NiSource recorded an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $6.0 million in 2010 and a decrease of $0.2 million in 2009 with an offset to legal and environmental accruals. The remaining decrease to expense of $5.8 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB regulatory asset NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $2.4 million in operation and maintenance expense in the second quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory asset related to OPEB that was not probable of recovery, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease to operation and maintenance expense of $0.2 million and an increase of $0.1 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $2.3 million was corrected prior to 2009. Healthcare claims In 2008, NiSource recorded an out of period credit of $13.3 million to correct the allocation of healthcare claims expense to active employees and retired participants in its other post employment benefits. As this error arose in 2007, NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2008 and 2007 for the impact of this error. Unbilled revenue In 2007, NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $25.5 million to correct an error that arose in prior years in its unbilled electric and gas revenue calculation. NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2007 for the impact of this error.

Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, were $3,462.7 million, a $22.2 million increase compared with 2010. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $56.4 million and increased Electric Operations net revenues of $7.6 million partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $21.3 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues increased primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during 2010. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were $3,440.5 million, a $106.9 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $113.1 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues were higher primarily as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, operating revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,572.2 million in 2011, an increase of $22.4 million from the comparable 2010 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of $59.2 million, higher impairment charges of $14.8 million and increased other taxes of $7.3 million. The increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of $14.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to Lake Erie Land. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case. Operating expenses were $2,549.8 million in 2010, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable 2009 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $36.0 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, and lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $14.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $0.4 million compared with 2010. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010 compared to $16.0 million in 2009. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2011 reduced income $438.0 million compared to a reduction of $485.2 million in 2010. The increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $42.8 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Also, there was a decrease in interest expense of $15.5 million. Interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in November 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in December 2010 and a long term debt maturity of $681.8 million in November 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in November 2010, the issuance of $500.0 million of long term debt in November 2011, $400.0 million in June 2011 and $250.0 million in December 2010, and higher average short term borrowings and rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.1 million in other, net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year. Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the Companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the Companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 35.0%, 32.2%, and 41.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2.8% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording $6.8 million in tax expense in the second quarter, and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. The effect of the rate settlements also was the primary 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2009, 2010 and 2011, and estimates for 2012. 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 Gas Distribution Operations $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 431.6 301.5 302.0 287.4 Electric Operations 413.6 267.7 190.3 162.6 Corporate and Other Operations 21.8 22.0 9.6 5.4 Total $ 1,400.0 $ 1,130.6 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 For 2012, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,400.0 million, which is $269.4 million higher than the 2011 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

On December 28, 2011, the IURC issued an Order approving Northern Indianas proposed gas energy efficiency programs and budgets, including a conservation program and recovery of all start up and deferred costs. A three year budget of $42.4 million for these programs was approved. In its Order the IURC recognized that Northern Indiana was one of two utilities in the state in a position to integrate its gas and electric energy efficiency programs throughout its service territory footprint. Northern Indiana is presently working through implementation plans. On June 1, 2011, Columbia of Virginia filed an application for approval of an infrastructure tracking mechanism pursuant to the Steps to Advance Virginias Energy (SAVE) Plan Act. Columbia of Virginias SAVE Plan provides for recovery of costs associated with the accelerated replacement of certain facilities designed to improve system safety or reliability through a rate rider. The proposed replacement program would result in investments of $20 million per year from 2012 through 2016, as well as covering $2.9 million in investment occurring in 2011. The Staff of the VSCC filed responsive testimony on August 22, 2011 and a public hearing was held on September 7, 2011. The Hearing Examiner issued a Report on October 6, 2011 recommending approval of the SAVE Plan. The VSCC issued an Order on November 28, 2011 approving the SAVE Plan and the associated rider effective December 30, 2011. On January 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania filed a base rate case with the Pennsylvania PUC, seeking a revenue increase of approximately $37.8 million annually. The parties to the case jointly filed a petition for approval of a partial settlement on July 1, 2011. The partial settlement resolved all issues except residential rate design and a challenge to the structure of one of Columbia of Pennsylvanias customer programs. The settlement provides for an annual revenue increase of $17 million. The Pennsylvania PUC issued an order on October 14, 2011 approving the annual revenue increase of $17 million. New rates went into effect on October 18, 2011. The Pennsylvania PUCs ruling increased the minimum residential customer charge from $12.25 to $18.73, which includes an allowance for 20 Ccf of distribution charges. However, the customer pays for gas commodity on all usage. On November 30, 2010, Columbia of Ohio filed a notice of intent to file an application to adjust rates associated with Rider IRP and Rider DSM. On February 28, 2011, Columbia of Ohio filed its application to adjust rates associated with the IRP and DSM Riders. The DSM Rider tracks and recovers costs associated with Columbia of Ohios energy efficiency and conservation programs. The application sought to increase the annual revenue from the riders by approximately $24 million. On April 7, 2011, the parties filed a stipulation that settled this case, which was approved as filed by the PUCO on April 27, 2011. The Order allowed Columbia of Ohio to increase its annual revenues by approximately $24 million effective May 1, 2011. On September 9, 2011, Columbia of Ohio filed an application with PUCO to continue and expand its DSM program. In its application, Columbia of Ohio proposed to spend $20 million annually (adjusted for inflation) on weatherization programs for residential and commercial customers for calendar years 2012 through 2016. Columbia of Ohio will continue to recover program expenses through Rider DSM and has proposed a shared savings incentive not to exceed $3.9 million over the five year program. By Order dated December 14, 2011, the PUCO approved a stipulation filed in the case. On October 28, 2010, Columbia Gulf filed a rate case with the FERC, proposing a rate increase and tariff changes. Among other things, the filing proposed a revenue increase of approximately $50 million to cover increases in the cost of services, which included adjustments for operation and maintenance expenses, capital investments, adjustments to depreciation rates and expense, rate of return, and increased federal, state and local taxes. On November 30, 2010, the FERC issued an Order allowing new rates to become effective by May 2011, subject to refund. Columbia Gulf placed new rates into effect, subject to refund, on May 1, 2011. Columbia Gulf and the active parties to the case negotiated a settlement, which was filed with the FERC on September 9, 2011. On September 30, 2011, the Chief Judge severed the issues relating to a contesting party for separate hearing and decision. On October 4, 2011, the Presiding Administrative Law Judge certified the settlement agreement as uncontested to the FERC with severance of the contesting party from the settlement. On November 1, 2011, Columbia Gulf began billing interim rates to customers. On December 1, 2011, the FERC issued an Order approving the settlement without change. The key elements of the settlement, which was a black box agreement, include: (1) increased base rate to $0.1520 per Dth and (2) establishing a postage stamp rate design. No protests to the Order were filed and therefore, pursuant to the Settlement, the order became final on January 1, 2012 which made the settlement effective on February 1, 2012. On February 2, 2012, the Presiding Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision granting a joint motion terminating the remaining litigation with the contesting party and allowing it to become a settling party. Refunds of approximately $16 million, accrued as of December 31, 2011, are to be issued before the end of March 2012. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 18, 2011, Northern Indiana filed with the IURC a settlement in its 2010 Electric Rate Case with the OUCC, Northern Indiana Industrial Group, NLMK Indiana and Indiana Municipal Utilities Group. The settlement agreement limited the proposed base rate impact to the residential customer class to a 4.5% increase. The parties have also agreed to a rate of return of 6.98% based upon a 10.2% return on equity. The settlement also resolves all pending issues related to compliance with the August 25, 2010 Order in the 2008 Electric Rate Case. On December 21, 2011, the IURC issued an Order approving the Settlement Agreement as filed, and new electric base rates became effective on December 27, 2011. On January 20, 2012, the City of Hammond filed an appeal of the IURCs December 21, 2011 Order. That appeal is pending. On March 22, 2011, Northern Indiana filed a petition with the IURC for a certificate of public convenience and necessity and associated relief for the construction of additional environmental projects required to comply with the NOV consent decree lodged in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana on January 13, 2011. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, for additional information. This petition has since been trifurcated into three separate phases. In terms of Phase I, the evidentiary hearing was held at the IURC on August 31, 2011 addressing the relief regarding (i) the construction of a FGD unit at R.M. Schahfer Generating Station Unit 15 and (ii) a cost estimate increase for the projects approved by the December 29, 2010 Order, which included estimates for a FGD unit at R.M. Schahfer Generating Station Unit 14 and associated common facilities for Units 14 and 15. On December 28, 2011, the IURC issued an order for the Phase I projects estimated to cost $500 million and granting the requested ratemaking and accounting relief associated with these Phase I projects. On November 9, 2011, Northern Indiana filed with the IURC a stipulation and settlement agreement with the OUCC and the Industrial Group resolving all issues regarding the Phase II projects, which includes all remaining projects with the exception of those projects related to Michigan City Generating Station Unit 12. The motion also requested the establishment of and a procedural schedule for a new Phase III for the Unit 12 projects. The evidentiary hearing was held for the Phase II projects at the IURC on December 14, 2011. On February 15, 2012, the IURC approved the stipulation and settlement agreement. The establishment of a Phase III in this proceeding occurred in response to the fact that on October 20, 2011 and October 21, 2011, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, respectively, filed testimony in opposition of the proposed construction of a FGD unit on Michigan City Generating Station Unit 12. On February 14, 2012, the IURC set a procedural schedule for the Phase III projects. As part of a multi state effort to strengthen the electric transmission system serving the Midwest, Northern Indiana anticipates making an investment in a new, 100 mile, 345 kilovolt transmission project in northern Indiana. The project, a major new transmission system improvement reviewed and authorized by the MISO, is scheduled to be in service during the latter part of the decade. Northern Indiana has also been identified by the MISO as one of two Transmission Owners to invest in another project. On February 8, 2012, Pioneer Transmission, LLC filed a complaint with the FERC, seeking to obtain 100% of the investment rights in this second project. Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of regulatory matters. Commercial Growth and Expansion of the Gas Transmission and Storage Business During 2011, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations placed into service strategic growth projects, primarily serving the Marcellus Shale production area. Below is a discussion of these projects as well as projects that are currently on going. Majorsville, PA Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter of 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Financial Management of the Balance Sheet NiSource remains committed to maintaining its liquidity position through management of capital spending, working capital and operational requirements, and its financing needs. NiSource has executed on its plan by taking the following actions: On November 23, 2011, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 4.45% senior unsecured notes that mature December 1, 2021 and $250.0 million of 5.80% senior unsecured notes that mature February 1, 2042. On November 14, 2011, NiSource Finance commenced a cash tender offer for up to $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 and 6.15% notes due 2013. A condition of the offering was that all validly tendered 2016 notes would be accepted for purchase before any 2013 notes were accepted. On December 13, 2011, NiSource Finance announced that approximately $125.3 million of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 were validly tendered and accepted for purchase. In addition, approximately $228.7 million of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.15% notes due 2013 were validly tendered, of which $124.7 million were accepted for purchase. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 470, Debt, NiSource Finance determined the debt issued on November 23, 2011, was substantially different from the tendered notes, and therefore the transaction qualified as a debt extinguishment. NiSource Finance recorded a $53.9 million loss on early extinguishment of long term debt, primarily attributable to early redemption premiums and unamortized discounts and fees. During July 2011, Northern Indiana redeemed $18.7 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.30%. On June 10, 2011, NiSource Finance issued $400.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes that mature June 15, 2041. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility has a termination date of March 3, 2015 and replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility, which would have expired during July 2011. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Process and Expense Management Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on process and expense management. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Ethics and Controls NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the Companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Results of Operations The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource as discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $303.8 million, or $1.08 per basic share, compared to $285.2 million, or $1.03 per basic share in 2010. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $229.8 million, or $0.84 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2011 net income of $299.1 million, or $1.06 per basic share, 2010 net income of $282.6 million, or $1.02 per basic share, and 2009 net income of $217.0 million, or $0.79 per basic share. Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations. A decrease in operating expenses of $40.4 million for the 2011 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs. In the 2010 period, a decrease in operating expenses of $7.6 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These changes from 2010 to 2011 were largely attributable to fluctuations in recoveries associated with low income assistance programs. Immaterial Restatement As discussed further below, NiSource is making certain correcting adjustments to its historical financial statements for the quarters of 2011 and 2010 and for the years of 2010 and 2009, as well as to other selected financial data for the years 2008 and 2007. NiSource does not believe these corrections are material individually or in the aggregate to its financial condition or its financial results for any reported period. Refer to the tables below for the effects of these corrections on prior periods. Deferred revenue In the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource identified a deferred revenue regulatory asset of $25.2 million that was not recoverable. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease in electric revenue of $7.4 million and an increase of $1.0 million, respectively, with an offset to deferred revenue regulatory assets. The remaining decrease in electric revenue of $18.2 million was corrected prior to 2009. The correction reduced electric revenue by a total of $0.6 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011. There was no impact to customers as a result of this correction. Environmental asset recovery NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $3.4 million in operation and maintenance expense and $4.6 million in depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory environmental asset that was not recoverable, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase to expense of $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $5.6 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB over reimbursement In the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource identified an over reimbursement of $8.0 million received by NiSource from an insurer related to other post employment benefits. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, with an offset to other accruals. The remaining increase in expense of $5.4 million was corrected prior to 2009. The correction increased expense by a total of $0.5 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Environmental accrual In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded an out of period reduction to expense of $6.0 million to reduce an environmental liability that was incorrectly recorded in a prior year. To reverse the liability in the proper periods, NiSource recorded an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $6.0 million in 2010 and a decrease of $0.2 million in 2009 with an offset to legal and environmental accruals. The remaining decrease to expense of $5.8 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB regulatory asset NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $2.4 million in operation and maintenance expense in the second quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory asset related to OPEB that was not probable of recovery, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease to operation and maintenance expense of $0.2 million and an increase of $0.1 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $2.3 million was corrected prior to 2009. Healthcare claims In 2008, NiSource recorded an out of period credit of $13.3 million to correct the allocation of healthcare claims expense to active employees and retired participants in its other post employment benefits. As this error arose in 2007, NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2008 and 2007 for the impact of this error. Unbilled revenue In 2007, NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $25.5 million to correct an error that arose in prior years in its unbilled electric and gas revenue calculation. NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2007 for the impact of this error. The following tables set forth the effects of the correcting adjustments to Net Income, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and for the quarterly periods in 2011 and 2010: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) in Net Income 2010 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Previously reported Net Income $ 292.0 $ 217.7 $ 79.0 $ 321.4 Deferred revenue (7.4 ) 1.0 2.7 (5.7 ) Environmental asset recovery (1.4 ) (1.0 ) (1.2 ) (1.8 ) OPEB over reimbursement (1.0 ) (1.1 ) (1.2 ) (1.1 ) Environmental accrual (6.0 ) 0.2 1.1 0.5 OPEB regulatory asset 0.2 (0.1 ) 0.1 0.2 Healthcare claims (13.3 ) 13.3 Unbilled revenue 25.5 Total corrections (15.6 ) (1.0 ) (11.8 ) 30.9 Income taxes (6.2 ) (0.3 ) (4.4 ) 12.0 Corrected Net Income $ 282.6 $ 217.0 $ 71.6 $ 340.3 Three Months Ended Increase (Decrease) in Net Income September 30,2011 June 30,2011 March 31,2011 December 31,2010 September 30,2010 June 30,2010 March 31,2010 (in millions) Previously reported Net Income $ 34.7 $ 38.9 $ 205.2 $ 33.4 $ 33.2 $ 28.1 $ 197.3 Deferred revenue (0.6 ) (2.1 ) (2.4 ) (1.0 ) (1.9 ) Environmental asset recovery 8.0 (0.5 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) OPEB over reimbursement (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) Environmental accrual (6.4 ) 0.2 0.2 OPEB regulatory asset 2.4 0.1 0.1 Total corrections (0.1 ) 2.2 7.2 (2.7 ) (9.3 ) (1.3 ) (2.3 ) Income taxes (0.1 ) 0.9 2.9 (1.1 ) (3.7 ) (0.5 ) (0.9 ) Corrected Net Income $ 34.7 $ 40.2 $ 209.5 $ 31.8 $ 27.6 $ 27.3 $ 195.9 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, were $3,462.7 million, a $22.2 million increase compared with 2010. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $56.4 million and increased Electric Operations net revenues of $7.6 million partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $21.3 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues increased primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during 2010. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were $3,440.5 million, a $106.9 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $113.1 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues were higher primarily as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, operating revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,572.2 million in 2011, an increase of $22.4 million from the comparable 2010 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of $59.2 million, higher impairment charges of $14.8 million and increased other taxes of $7.3 million. The increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of $14.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to Lake Erie Land. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case. Operating expenses were $2,549.8 million in 2010, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable 2009 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $36.0 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, and lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $14.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $0.4 million compared with 2010. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010 compared to $16.0 million in 2009. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2011 reduced income $438.0 million compared to a reduction of $485.2 million in 2010. The increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $42.8 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Also, there was a decrease in interest expense of $15.5 million. Interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in November 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in December 2010 and a long term debt maturity of $681.8 million in November 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in November 2010, the issuance of $500.0 million of long term debt in November 2011, $400.0 million in June 2011 and $250.0 million in December 2010, and higher average short term borrowings and rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.1 million in other, net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year. Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the Companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the Companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 35.0%, 32.2%, and 41.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2.8% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording $6.8 million in tax expense in the second quarter, and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. The effect of the rate settlements also was the primary 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012.

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 18, 2011, Northern Indiana filed with the IURC a settlement in its 2010 Electric Rate Case with the OUCC, Northern Indiana Industrial Group, NLMK Indiana and Indiana Municipal Utilities Group. The settlement agreement limited the proposed base rate impact to the residential customer class to a 4.5% increase. The parties have also agreed to a rate of return of 6.98% based upon a 10.2% return on equity. The settlement also resolves all pending issues related to compliance with the August 25, 2010 Order in the 2008 Electric Rate Case. On December 21, 2011, the IURC issued an Order approving the Settlement Agreement as filed, and new electric base rates became effective on December 27, 2011. On January 20, 2012, the City of Hammond filed an appeal of the IURCs December 21, 2011 Order. That appeal is pending. On March 22, 2011, Northern Indiana filed a petition with the IURC for a certificate of public convenience and necessity and associated relief for the construction of additional environmental projects required to comply with the NOV consent decree lodged in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana on January 13, 2011. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, for additional information. This petition has since been trifurcated into three separate phases. In terms of Phase I, the evidentiary hearing was held at the IURC on August 31, 2011 addressing the relief regarding (i) the construction of a FGD unit at R.M. Schahfer Generating Station Unit 15 and (ii) a cost estimate increase for the projects approved by the December 29, 2010 Order, which included estimates for a FGD unit at R.M. Schahfer Generating Station Unit 14 and associated common facilities for Units 14 and 15. On December 28, 2011, the IURC issued an order for the Phase I projects estimated to cost $500 million and granting the requested ratemaking and accounting relief associated with these Phase I projects. On November 9, 2011, Northern Indiana filed with the IURC a stipulation and settlement agreement with the OUCC and the Industrial Group resolving all issues regarding the Phase II projects, which includes all remaining projects with the exception of those projects related to Michigan City Generating Station Unit 12. The motion also requested the establishment of and a procedural schedule for a new Phase III for the Unit 12 projects. The evidentiary hearing was held for the Phase II projects at the IURC on December 14, 2011. On February 15, 2012, the IURC approved the stipulation and settlement agreement. The establishment of a Phase III in this proceeding occurred in response to the fact that on October 20, 2011 and October 21, 2011, the OUCC and the Industrial Group, respectively, filed testimony in opposition of the proposed construction of a FGD unit on Michigan City Generating Station Unit 12. On February 14, 2012, the IURC set a procedural schedule for the Phase III projects. As part of a multi state effort to strengthen the electric transmission system serving the Midwest, Northern Indiana anticipates making an investment in a new, 100 mile, 345 kilovolt transmission project in northern Indiana. The project, a major new transmission system improvement reviewed and authorized by the MISO, is scheduled to be in service during the latter part of the decade. Northern Indiana has also been identified by the MISO as one of two Transmission Owners to invest in another project. On February 8, 2012, Pioneer Transmission, LLC filed a complaint with the FERC, seeking to obtain 100% of the investment rights in this second project. Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of regulatory matters. Commercial Growth and Expansion of the Gas Transmission and Storage Business During 2011, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations placed into service strategic growth projects, primarily serving the Marcellus Shale production area.

These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter of 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Financial Management of the Balance Sheet NiSource remains committed to maintaining its liquidity position through management of capital spending, working capital and operational requirements, and its financing needs. NiSource has executed on its plan by taking the following actions: On November 23, 2011, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 4.45% senior unsecured notes that mature December 1, 2021 and $250.0 million of 5.80% senior unsecured notes that mature February 1, 2042. On November 14, 2011, NiSource Finance commenced a cash tender offer for up to $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 and 6.15% notes due 2013. A condition of the offering was that all validly tendered 2016 notes would be accepted for purchase before any 2013 notes were accepted. On December 13, 2011, NiSource Finance announced that approximately $125.3 million of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 were validly tendered and accepted for purchase. In addition, approximately $228.7 million of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.15% notes due 2013 were validly tendered, of which $124.7 million were accepted for purchase. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 470, Debt, NiSource Finance determined the debt issued on November 23, 2011, was substantially different from the tendered notes, and therefore the transaction qualified as a debt extinguishment. NiSource Finance recorded a $53.9 million loss on early extinguishment of long term debt, primarily attributable to early redemption premiums and unamortized discounts and fees. During July 2011, Northern Indiana redeemed $18.7 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.30%. On June 10, 2011, NiSource Finance issued $400.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes that mature June 15, 2041. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility has a termination date of March 3, 2015 and replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility, which would have expired during July 2011. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Ethics and Controls NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the Companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Results of Operations The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource as discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $303.8 million, or $1.08 per basic share, compared to $285.2 million, or $1.03 per basic share in 2010. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $229.8 million, or $0.84 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2011 net income of $299.1 million, or $1.06 per basic share, 2010 net income of $282.6 million, or $1.02 per basic share, and 2009 net income of $217.0 million, or $0.79 per basic share. Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations. A decrease in operating expenses of $40.4 million for the 2011 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs. In the 2010 period, a decrease in operating expenses of $7.6 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These changes from 2010 to 2011 were largely attributable to fluctuations in recoveries associated with low income assistance programs. Immaterial Restatement As discussed further below, NiSource is making certain correcting adjustments to its historical financial statements for the quarters of 2011 and 2010 and for the years of 2010 and 2009, as well as to other selected financial data for the years 2008 and 2007. NiSource does not believe these corrections are material individually or in the aggregate to its financial condition or its financial results for any reported period. Refer to the tables below for the effects of these corrections on prior periods. Deferred revenue In the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource identified a deferred revenue regulatory asset of $25.2 million that was not recoverable. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease in electric revenue of $7.4 million and an increase of $1.0 million, respectively, with an offset to deferred revenue regulatory assets. The remaining decrease in electric revenue of $18.2 million was corrected prior to 2009. The correction reduced electric revenue by a total of $0.6 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011. There was no impact to customers as a result of this correction. Environmental asset recovery NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $3.4 million in operation and maintenance expense and $4.6 million in depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory environmental asset that was not recoverable, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase to expense of $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $5.6 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB over reimbursement In the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource identified an over reimbursement of $8.0 million received by NiSource from an insurer related to other post employment benefits. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, with an offset to other accruals. The remaining increase in expense of $5.4 million was corrected prior to 2009. The correction increased expense by a total of $0.5 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Environmental accrual In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded an out of period reduction to expense of $6.0 million to reduce an environmental liability that was incorrectly recorded in a prior year. To reverse the liability in the proper periods, NiSource recorded an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $6.0 million in 2010 and a decrease of $0.2 million in 2009 with an offset to legal and environmental accruals. The remaining decrease to expense of $5.8 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB regulatory asset NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $2.4 million in operation and maintenance expense in the second quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory asset related to OPEB that was not probable of recovery, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease to operation and maintenance expense of $0.2 million and an increase of $0.1 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $2.3 million was corrected prior to 2009. Healthcare claims In 2008, NiSource recorded an out of period credit of $13.3 million to correct the allocation of healthcare claims expense to active employees and retired participants in its other post employment benefits. As this error arose in 2007, NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2008 and 2007 for the impact of this error. Unbilled revenue In 2007, NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $25.5 million to correct an error that arose in prior years in its unbilled electric and gas revenue calculation. NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2007 for the impact of this error. The following tables set forth the effects of the correcting adjustments to Net Income, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and for the quarterly periods in 2011 and 2010: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) in Net Income 2010 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Previously reported Net Income $ 292.0 $ 217.7 $ 79.0 $ 321.4 Deferred revenue (7.4 ) 1.0 2.7 (5.7 ) Environmental asset recovery (1.4 ) (1.0 ) (1.2 ) (1.8 ) OPEB over reimbursement (1.0 ) (1.1 ) (1.2 ) (1.1 ) Environmental accrual (6.0 ) 0.2 1.1 0.5 OPEB regulatory asset 0.2 (0.1 ) 0.1 0.2 Healthcare claims (13.3 ) 13.3 Unbilled revenue 25.5 Total corrections (15.6 ) (1.0 ) (11.8 ) 30.9 Income taxes (6.2 ) (0.3 ) (4.4 ) 12.0 Corrected Net Income $ 282.6 $ 217.0 $ 71.6 $ 340.3 Three Months Ended Increase (Decrease) in Net Income September 30,2011 June 30,2011 March 31,2011 December 31,2010 September 30,2010 June 30,2010 March 31,2010 (in millions) Previously reported Net Income $ 34.7 $ 38.9 $ 205.2 $ 33.4 $ 33.2 $ 28.1 $ 197.3 Deferred revenue (0.6 ) (2.1 ) (2.4 ) (1.0 ) (1.9 ) Environmental asset recovery 8.0 (0.5 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) OPEB over reimbursement (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) Environmental accrual (6.4 ) 0.2 0.2 OPEB regulatory asset 2.4 0.1 0.1 Total corrections (0.1 ) 2.2 7.2 (2.7 ) (9.3 ) (1.3 ) (2.3 ) Income taxes (0.1 ) 0.9 2.9 (1.1 ) (3.7 ) (0.5 ) (0.9 ) Corrected Net Income $ 34.7 $ 40.2 $ 209.5 $ 31.8 $ 27.6 $ 27.3 $ 195.9 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, were $3,462.7 million, a $22.2 million increase compared with 2010. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $56.4 million and increased Electric Operations net revenues of $7.6 million partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $21.3 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues increased primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during 2010. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were $3,440.5 million, a $106.9 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $113.1 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues were higher primarily as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, operating revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,572.2 million in 2011, an increase of $22.4 million from the comparable 2010 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of $59.2 million, higher impairment charges of $14.8 million and increased other taxes of $7.3 million. The increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of $14.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to Lake Erie Land. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case. Operating expenses were $2,549.8 million in 2010, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable 2009 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $36.0 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, and lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $14.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $0.4 million compared with 2010. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010 compared to $16.0 million in 2009. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2011 reduced income $438.0 million compared to a reduction of $485.2 million in 2010. The increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $42.8 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Also, there was a decrease in interest expense of $15.5 million. Interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in November 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in December 2010 and a long term debt maturity of $681.8 million in November 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in November 2010, the issuance of $500.0 million of long term debt in November 2011, $400.0 million in June 2011 and $250.0 million in December 2010, and higher average short term borrowings and rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.1 million in other, net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year. Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the Companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the Companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 35.0%, 32.2%, and 41.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2.8% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording $6.8 million in tax expense in the second quarter, and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. The effect of the rate settlements also was the primary 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2009, 2010 and 2011, and estimates for 2012. 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 Gas Distribution Operations $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 431.6 301.5 302.0 287.4 Electric Operations 413.6 267.7 190.3 162.6 Corporate and Other Operations 21.8 22.0 9.6 5.4 Total $ 1,400.0 $ 1,130.6 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 For 2012, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,400.0 million, which is $269.4 million higher than the 2011 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Existing resources are expected to be sufficient, assuming favorable outcomes for environmental upgrades, to meet customers needs for the next decade. Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 25.3 $ 28.0 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 Maintenance and Other 388.3 239.7 164.5 129.9 Total $ 413.6 $ 267.7 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 were higher by $77.4 million versus 2010. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter of 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Financial Management of the Balance Sheet NiSource remains committed to maintaining its liquidity position through management of capital spending, working capital and operational requirements, and its financing needs. NiSource has executed on its plan by taking the following actions: On November 23, 2011, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 4.45% senior unsecured notes that mature December 1, 2021 and $250.0 million of 5.80% senior unsecured notes that mature February 1, 2042. On November 14, 2011, NiSource Finance commenced a cash tender offer for up to $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 and 6.15% notes due 2013. A condition of the offering was that all validly tendered 2016 notes would be accepted for purchase before any 2013 notes were accepted. On December 13, 2011, NiSource Finance announced that approximately $125.3 million of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 were validly tendered and accepted for purchase. In addition, approximately $228.7 million of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.15% notes due 2013 were validly tendered, of which $124.7 million were accepted for purchase. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 470, Debt, NiSource Finance determined the debt issued on November 23, 2011, was substantially different from the tendered notes, and therefore the transaction qualified as a debt extinguishment. NiSource Finance recorded a $53.9 million loss on early extinguishment of long term debt, primarily attributable to early redemption premiums and unamortized discounts and fees. During July 2011, Northern Indiana redeemed $18.7 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.30%. On June 10, 2011, NiSource Finance issued $400.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes that mature June 15, 2041. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility has a termination date of March 3, 2015 and replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility, which would have expired during July 2011. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Process and Expense Management Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on process and expense management. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Ethics and Controls NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the Companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Results of Operations The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource as discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $303.8 million, or $1.08 per basic share, compared to $285.2 million, or $1.03 per basic share in 2010. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $229.8 million, or $0.84 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2011 net income of $299.1 million, or $1.06 per basic share, 2010 net income of $282.6 million, or $1.02 per basic share, and 2009 net income of $217.0 million, or $0.79 per basic share. Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations. A decrease in operating expenses of $40.4 million for the 2011 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs. In the 2010 period, a decrease in operating expenses of $7.6 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These changes from 2010 to 2011 were largely attributable to fluctuations in recoveries associated with low income assistance programs. Immaterial Restatement As discussed further below, NiSource is making certain correcting adjustments to its historical financial statements for the quarters of 2011 and 2010 and for the years of 2010 and 2009, as well as to other selected financial data for the years 2008 and 2007. NiSource does not believe these corrections are material individually or in the aggregate to its financial condition or its financial results for any reported period. Refer to the tables below for the effects of these corrections on prior periods. Deferred revenue In the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource identified a deferred revenue regulatory asset of $25.2 million that was not recoverable. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease in electric revenue of $7.4 million and an increase of $1.0 million, respectively, with an offset to deferred revenue regulatory assets. The remaining decrease in electric revenue of $18.2 million was corrected prior to 2009. The correction reduced electric revenue by a total of $0.6 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011. There was no impact to customers as a result of this correction. Environmental asset recovery NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $3.4 million in operation and maintenance expense and $4.6 million in depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory environmental asset that was not recoverable, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase to expense of $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $5.6 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB over reimbursement In the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource identified an over reimbursement of $8.0 million received by NiSource from an insurer related to other post employment benefits. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, with an offset to other accruals. The remaining increase in expense of $5.4 million was corrected prior to 2009. The correction increased expense by a total of $0.5 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Environmental accrual In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded an out of period reduction to expense of $6.0 million to reduce an environmental liability that was incorrectly recorded in a prior year. To reverse the liability in the proper periods, NiSource recorded an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $6.0 million in 2010 and a decrease of $0.2 million in 2009 with an offset to legal and environmental accruals. The remaining decrease to expense of $5.8 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB regulatory asset NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $2.4 million in operation and maintenance expense in the second quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory asset related to OPEB that was not probable of recovery, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease to operation and maintenance expense of $0.2 million and an increase of $0.1 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $2.3 million was corrected prior to 2009. Healthcare claims In 2008, NiSource recorded an out of period credit of $13.3 million to correct the allocation of healthcare claims expense to active employees and retired participants in its other post employment benefits. As this error arose in 2007, NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2008 and 2007 for the impact of this error. Unbilled revenue In 2007, NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $25.5 million to correct an error that arose in prior years in its unbilled electric and gas revenue calculation. NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2007 for the impact of this error.

Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, were $3,462.7 million, a $22.2 million increase compared with 2010. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $56.4 million and increased Electric Operations net revenues of $7.6 million partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $21.3 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues increased primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during 2010. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were $3,440.5 million, a $106.9 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $113.1 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues were higher primarily as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, operating revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,572.2 million in 2011, an increase of $22.4 million from the comparable 2010 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of $59.2 million, higher impairment charges of $14.8 million and increased other taxes of $7.3 million. The increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of $14.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to Lake Erie Land. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case. Operating expenses were $2,549.8 million in 2010, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable 2009 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $36.0 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, and lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $14.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $0.4 million compared with 2010. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010 compared to $16.0 million in 2009. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2011 reduced income $438.0 million compared to a reduction of $485.2 million in 2010. The increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $42.8 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Also, there was a decrease in interest expense of $15.5 million. Interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in November 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in December 2010 and a long term debt maturity of $681.8 million in November 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in November 2010, the issuance of $500.0 million of long term debt in November 2011, $400.0 million in June 2011 and $250.0 million in December 2010, and higher average short term borrowings and rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.1 million in other, net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year. Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the Companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the Companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 35.0%, 32.2%, and 41.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2.8% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording $6.8 million in tax expense in the second quarter, and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. The effect of the rate settlements also was the primary 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2009, 2010 and 2011, and estimates for 2012. 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 Gas Distribution Operations $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 431.6 301.5 302.0 287.4 Electric Operations 413.6 267.7 190.3 162.6 Corporate and Other Operations 21.8 22.0 9.6 5.4 Total $ 1,400.0 $ 1,130.6 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 For 2012, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,400.0 million, which is $269.4 million higher than the 2011 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Financial Management of the Balance Sheet NiSource remains committed to maintaining its liquidity position through management of capital spending, working capital and operational requirements, and its financing needs. NiSource has executed on its plan by taking the following actions: On November 23, 2011, NiSource Finance issued $250.0 million of 4.45% senior unsecured notes that mature December 1, 2021 and $250.0 million of 5.80% senior unsecured notes that mature February 1, 2042. On November 14, 2011, NiSource Finance commenced a cash tender offer for up to $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 and 6.15% notes due 2013. A condition of the offering was that all validly tendered 2016 notes would be accepted for purchase before any 2013 notes were accepted. On December 13, 2011, NiSource Finance announced that approximately $125.3 million of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 were validly tendered and accepted for purchase. In addition, approximately $228.7 million of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.15% notes due 2013 were validly tendered, of which $124.7 million were accepted for purchase. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 470, Debt, NiSource Finance determined the debt issued on November 23, 2011, was substantially different from the tendered notes, and therefore the transaction qualified as a debt extinguishment. NiSource Finance recorded a $53.9 million loss on early extinguishment of long term debt, primarily attributable to early redemption premiums and unamortized discounts and fees. During July 2011, Northern Indiana redeemed $18.7 million of its medium term notes, with an average interest rate of 7.30%. On June 10, 2011, NiSource Finance issued $400.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes that mature June 15, 2041. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility has a termination date of March 3, 2015 and replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility, which would have expired during July 2011. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Ethics and Controls NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the Companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Results of Operations The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource as discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $303.8 million, or $1.08 per basic share, compared to $285.2 million, or $1.03 per basic share in 2010. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $229.8 million, or $0.84 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2011 net income of $299.1 million, or $1.06 per basic share, 2010 net income of $282.6 million, or $1.02 per basic share, and 2009 net income of $217.0 million, or $0.79 per basic share. Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations. A decrease in operating expenses of $40.4 million for the 2011 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs. In the 2010 period, a decrease in operating expenses of $7.6 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These changes from 2010 to 2011 were largely attributable to fluctuations in recoveries associated with low income assistance programs. Immaterial Restatement As discussed further below, NiSource is making certain correcting adjustments to its historical financial statements for the quarters of 2011 and 2010 and for the years of 2010 and 2009, as well as to other selected financial data for the years 2008 and 2007. NiSource does not believe these corrections are material individually or in the aggregate to its financial condition or its financial results for any reported period. Refer to the tables below for the effects of these corrections on prior periods. Deferred revenue In the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource identified a deferred revenue regulatory asset of $25.2 million that was not recoverable. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease in electric revenue of $7.4 million and an increase of $1.0 million, respectively, with an offset to deferred revenue regulatory assets. The remaining decrease in electric revenue of $18.2 million was corrected prior to 2009. The correction reduced electric revenue by a total of $0.6 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011. There was no impact to customers as a result of this correction. Environmental asset recovery NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $3.4 million in operation and maintenance expense and $4.6 million in depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory environmental asset that was not recoverable, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase to expense of $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $5.6 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB over reimbursement In the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource identified an over reimbursement of $8.0 million received by NiSource from an insurer related to other post employment benefits. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, with an offset to other accruals. The remaining increase in expense of $5.4 million was corrected prior to 2009. The correction increased expense by a total of $0.5 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Environmental accrual In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded an out of period reduction to expense of $6.0 million to reduce an environmental liability that was incorrectly recorded in a prior year. To reverse the liability in the proper periods, NiSource recorded an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $6.0 million in 2010 and a decrease of $0.2 million in 2009 with an offset to legal and environmental accruals. The remaining decrease to expense of $5.8 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB regulatory asset NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $2.4 million in operation and maintenance expense in the second quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory asset related to OPEB that was not probable of recovery, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease to operation and maintenance expense of $0.2 million and an increase of $0.1 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $2.3 million was corrected prior to 2009. Healthcare claims In 2008, NiSource recorded an out of period credit of $13.3 million to correct the allocation of healthcare claims expense to active employees and retired participants in its other post employment benefits. As this error arose in 2007, NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2008 and 2007 for the impact of this error. Unbilled revenue In 2007, NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $25.5 million to correct an error that arose in prior years in its unbilled electric and gas revenue calculation. NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2007 for the impact of this error. The following tables set forth the effects of the correcting adjustments to Net Income, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and for the quarterly periods in 2011 and 2010: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) in Net Income 2010 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Previously reported Net Income $ 292.0 $ 217.7 $ 79.0 $ 321.4 Deferred revenue (7.4 ) 1.0 2.7 (5.7 ) Environmental asset recovery (1.4 ) (1.0 ) (1.2 ) (1.8 ) OPEB over reimbursement (1.0 ) (1.1 ) (1.2 ) (1.1 ) Environmental accrual (6.0 ) 0.2 1.1 0.5 OPEB regulatory asset 0.2 (0.1 ) 0.1 0.2 Healthcare claims (13.3 ) 13.3 Unbilled revenue 25.5 Total corrections (15.6 ) (1.0 ) (11.8 ) 30.9 Income taxes (6.2 ) (0.3 ) (4.4 ) 12.0 Corrected Net Income $ 282.6 $ 217.0 $ 71.6 $ 340.3 Three Months Ended Increase (Decrease) in Net Income September 30,2011 June 30,2011 March 31,2011 December 31,2010 September 30,2010 June 30,2010 March 31,2010 (in millions) Previously reported Net Income $ 34.7 $ 38.9 $ 205.2 $ 33.4 $ 33.2 $ 28.1 $ 197.3 Deferred revenue (0.6 ) (2.1 ) (2.4 ) (1.0 ) (1.9 ) Environmental asset recovery 8.0 (0.5 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) OPEB over reimbursement (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) Environmental accrual (6.4 ) 0.2 0.2 OPEB regulatory asset 2.4 0.1 0.1 Total corrections (0.1 ) 2.2 7.2 (2.7 ) (9.3 ) (1.3 ) (2.3 ) Income taxes (0.1 ) 0.9 2.9 (1.1 ) (3.7 ) (0.5 ) (0.9 ) Corrected Net Income $ 34.7 $ 40.2 $ 209.5 $ 31.8 $ 27.6 $ 27.3 $ 195.9 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, were $3,462.7 million, a $22.2 million increase compared with 2010. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $56.4 million and increased Electric Operations net revenues of $7.6 million partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $21.3 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues increased primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during 2010. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were $3,440.5 million, a $106.9 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $113.1 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues were higher primarily as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, operating revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,572.2 million in 2011, an increase of $22.4 million from the comparable 2010 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of $59.2 million, higher impairment charges of $14.8 million and increased other taxes of $7.3 million. The increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of $14.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to Lake Erie Land. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case. Operating expenses were $2,549.8 million in 2010, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable 2009 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $36.0 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, and lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $14.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $0.4 million compared with 2010. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010 compared to $16.0 million in 2009. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2011 reduced income $438.0 million compared to a reduction of $485.2 million in 2010. The increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $42.8 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Also, there was a decrease in interest expense of $15.5 million. Interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in November 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in December 2010 and a long term debt maturity of $681.8 million in November 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in November 2010, the issuance of $500.0 million of long term debt in November 2011, $400.0 million in June 2011 and $250.0 million in December 2010, and higher average short term borrowings and rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.1 million in other, net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year. Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the Companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the Companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 35.0%, 32.2%, and 41.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2.8% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording $6.8 million in tax expense in the second quarter, and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. The effect of the rate settlements also was the primary 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2009, 2010 and 2011, and estimates for 2012. 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 Gas Distribution Operations $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 431.6 301.5 302.0 287.4 Electric Operations 413.6 267.7 190.3 162.6 Corporate and Other Operations 21.8 22.0 9.6 5.4 Total $ 1,400.0 $ 1,130.6 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 For 2012, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,400.0 million, which is $269.4 million higher than the 2011 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. Existing resources are expected to be sufficient, assuming favorable outcomes for environmental upgrades, to meet customers needs for the next decade. Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 25.3 $ 28.0 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 Maintenance and Other 388.3 239.7 164.5 129.9 Total $ 413.6 $ 267.7 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 were higher by $77.4 million versus 2010. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Ethics and Controls NiSource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the development of this Form 10 K and the monitoring of the Companys internal control structure and performance. In addition, NiSource will continue its mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Results of Operations The following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by NiSource as discussed in Other Information of this Item 7. Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $303.8 million, or $1.08 per basic share, compared to $285.2 million, or $1.03 per basic share in 2010. Income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $229.8 million, or $0.84 per basic share. Including results from discontinued operations, NiSource reported 2011 net income of $299.1 million, or $1.06 per basic share, 2010 net income of $282.6 million, or $1.02 per basic share, and 2009 net income of $217.0 million, or $0.79 per basic share. Comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations. A decrease in operating expenses of $40.4 million for the 2011 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs. In the 2010 period, a decrease in operating expenses of $7.6 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. These changes from 2010 to 2011 were largely attributable to fluctuations in recoveries associated with low income assistance programs. Immaterial Restatement As discussed further below, NiSource is making certain correcting adjustments to its historical financial statements for the quarters of 2011 and 2010 and for the years of 2010 and 2009, as well as to other selected financial data for the years 2008 and 2007. NiSource does not believe these corrections are material individually or in the aggregate to its financial condition or its financial results for any reported period. Refer to the tables below for the effects of these corrections on prior periods. Deferred revenue In the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource identified a deferred revenue regulatory asset of $25.2 million that was not recoverable. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease in electric revenue of $7.4 million and an increase of $1.0 million, respectively, with an offset to deferred revenue regulatory assets. The remaining decrease in electric revenue of $18.2 million was corrected prior to 2009. The correction reduced electric revenue by a total of $0.6 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011. There was no impact to customers as a result of this correction. Environmental asset recovery NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $3.4 million in operation and maintenance expense and $4.6 million in depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory environmental asset that was not recoverable, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase to expense of $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $5.6 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB over reimbursement In the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource identified an over reimbursement of $8.0 million received by NiSource from an insurer related to other post employment benefits. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, with an offset to other accruals. The remaining increase in expense of $5.4 million was corrected prior to 2009. The correction increased expense by a total of $0.5 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Environmental accrual In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded an out of period reduction to expense of $6.0 million to reduce an environmental liability that was incorrectly recorded in a prior year. To reverse the liability in the proper periods, NiSource recorded an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $6.0 million in 2010 and a decrease of $0.2 million in 2009 with an offset to legal and environmental accruals. The remaining decrease to expense of $5.8 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB regulatory asset NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $2.4 million in operation and maintenance expense in the second quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory asset related to OPEB that was not probable of recovery, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease to operation and maintenance expense of $0.2 million and an increase of $0.1 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $2.3 million was corrected prior to 2009. Healthcare claims In 2008, NiSource recorded an out of period credit of $13.3 million to correct the allocation of healthcare claims expense to active employees and retired participants in its other post employment benefits. As this error arose in 2007, NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2008 and 2007 for the impact of this error. Unbilled revenue In 2007, NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $25.5 million to correct an error that arose in prior years in its unbilled electric and gas revenue calculation. NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2007 for the impact of this error. The following tables set forth the effects of the correcting adjustments to Net Income, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and for the quarterly periods in 2011 and 2010: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) in Net Income 2010 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Previously reported Net Income $ 292.0 $ 217.7 $ 79.0 $ 321.4 Deferred revenue (7.4 ) 1.0 2.7 (5.7 ) Environmental asset recovery (1.4 ) (1.0 ) (1.2 ) (1.8 ) OPEB over reimbursement (1.0 ) (1.1 ) (1.2 ) (1.1 ) Environmental accrual (6.0 ) 0.2 1.1 0.5 OPEB regulatory asset 0.2 (0.1 ) 0.1 0.2 Healthcare claims (13.3 ) 13.3 Unbilled revenue 25.5 Total corrections (15.6 ) (1.0 ) (11.8 ) 30.9 Income taxes (6.2 ) (0.3 ) (4.4 ) 12.0 Corrected Net Income $ 282.6 $ 217.0 $ 71.6 $ 340.3 Three Months Ended Increase (Decrease) in Net Income September 30,2011 June 30,2011 March 31,2011 December 31,2010 September 30,2010 June 30,2010 March 31,2010 (in millions) Previously reported Net Income $ 34.7 $ 38.9 $ 205.2 $ 33.4 $ 33.2 $ 28.1 $ 197.3 Deferred revenue (0.6 ) (2.1 ) (2.4 ) (1.0 ) (1.9 ) Environmental asset recovery 8.0 (0.5 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) OPEB over reimbursement (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) Environmental accrual (6.4 ) 0.2 0.2 OPEB regulatory asset 2.4 0.1 0.1 Total corrections (0.1 ) 2.2 7.2 (2.7 ) (9.3 ) (1.3 ) (2.3 ) Income taxes (0.1 ) 0.9 2.9 (1.1 ) (3.7 ) (0.5 ) (0.9 ) Corrected Net Income $ 34.7 $ 40.2 $ 209.5 $ 31.8 $ 27.6 $ 27.3 $ 195.9 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, were $3,462.7 million, a $22.2 million increase compared with 2010. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $56.4 million and increased Electric Operations net revenues of $7.6 million partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $21.3 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues increased primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during 2010. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were $3,440.5 million, a $106.9 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $113.1 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues were higher primarily as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, operating revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,572.2 million in 2011, an increase of $22.4 million from the comparable 2010 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of $59.2 million, higher impairment charges of $14.8 million and increased other taxes of $7.3 million. The increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of $14.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to Lake Erie Land. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case. Operating expenses were $2,549.8 million in 2010, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable 2009 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $36.0 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, and lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $14.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $0.4 million compared with 2010. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010 compared to $16.0 million in 2009. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2011 reduced income $438.0 million compared to a reduction of $485.2 million in 2010. The increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $42.8 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Also, there was a decrease in interest expense of $15.5 million. Interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in November 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in December 2010 and a long term debt maturity of $681.8 million in November 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in November 2010, the issuance of $500.0 million of long term debt in November 2011, $400.0 million in June 2011 and $250.0 million in December 2010, and higher average short term borrowings and rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.1 million in other, net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year. Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the Companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the Companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 35.0%, 32.2%, and 41.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2.8% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording $6.8 million in tax expense in the second quarter, and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. The effect of the rate settlements also was the primary 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2009, 2010 and 2011, and estimates for 2012. 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 Gas Distribution Operations $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 431.6 301.5 302.0 287.4 Electric Operations 413.6 267.7 190.3 162.6 Corporate and Other Operations 21.8 22.0 9.6 5.4 Total $ 1,400.0 $ 1,130.6 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 For 2012, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,400.0 million, which is $269.4 million higher than the 2011 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service.

International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012.

The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012.

The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Environmental accrual In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded an out of period reduction to expense of $6.0 million to reduce an environmental liability that was incorrectly recorded in a prior year. To reverse the liability in the proper periods, NiSource recorded an increase in operation and maintenance expense of $6.0 million in 2010 and a decrease of $0.2 million in 2009 with an offset to legal and environmental accruals. The remaining decrease to expense of $5.8 million was corrected prior to 2009. OPEB regulatory asset NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $2.4 million in operation and maintenance expense in the second quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory asset related to OPEB that was not probable of recovery, which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year. The impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease to operation and maintenance expense of $0.2 million and an increase of $0.1 million, respectively, with an offset to regulatory assets. The remaining increase to expense of $2.3 million was corrected prior to 2009. Healthcare claims In 2008, NiSource recorded an out of period credit of $13.3 million to correct the allocation of healthcare claims expense to active employees and retired participants in its other post employment benefits. As this error arose in 2007, NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2008 and 2007 for the impact of this error. Unbilled revenue In 2007, NiSource recorded an out of period charge of $25.5 million to correct an error that arose in prior years in its unbilled electric and gas revenue calculation. NiSource is correcting the selected financial data for 2007 for the impact of this error.

Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, were $3,462.7 million, a $22.2 million increase compared with 2010. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $56.4 million and increased Electric Operations net revenues of $7.6 million partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $21.3 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues increased primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during 2010. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were $3,440.5 million, a $106.9 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $113.1 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues were higher primarily as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, operating revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,572.2 million in 2011, an increase of $22.4 million from the comparable 2010 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of $59.2 million, higher impairment charges of $14.8 million and increased other taxes of $7.3 million. The increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of $14.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to Lake Erie Land. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case. Operating expenses were $2,549.8 million in 2010, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable 2009 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $36.0 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, and lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $14.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $0.4 million compared with 2010. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010 compared to $16.0 million in 2009. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2011 reduced income $438.0 million compared to a reduction of $485.2 million in 2010. The increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $42.8 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Also, there was a decrease in interest expense of $15.5 million. Interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in November 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in December 2010 and a long term debt maturity of $681.8 million in November 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in November 2010, the issuance of $500.0 million of long term debt in November 2011, $400.0 million in June 2011 and $250.0 million in December 2010, and higher average short term borrowings and rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.1 million in other, net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year. Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the Companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the Companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 35.0%, 32.2%, and 41.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2.8% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording $6.8 million in tax expense in the second quarter, and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. The effect of the rate settlements also was the primary 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2009, 2010 and 2011, and estimates for 2012. 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 Gas Distribution Operations $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 431.6 301.5 302.0 287.4 Electric Operations 413.6 267.7 190.3 162.6 Corporate and Other Operations 21.8 22.0 9.6 5.4 Total $ 1,400.0 $ 1,130.6 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 For 2012, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,400.0 million, which is $269.4 million higher than the 2011 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, were $3,462.7 million, a $22.2 million increase compared with 2010. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $56.4 million and increased Electric Operations net revenues of $7.6 million partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $21.3 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues increased primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during 2010. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were $3,440.5 million, a $106.9 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $113.1 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues were higher primarily as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, operating revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,572.2 million in 2011, an increase of $22.4 million from the comparable 2010 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of $59.2 million, higher impairment charges of $14.8 million and increased other taxes of $7.3 million. The increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of $14.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to Lake Erie Land. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case. Operating expenses were $2,549.8 million in 2010, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable 2009 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $36.0 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, and lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $14.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $0.4 million compared with 2010. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010 compared to $16.0 million in 2009. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2011 reduced income $438.0 million compared to a reduction of $485.2 million in 2010. The increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $42.8 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Also, there was a decrease in interest expense of $15.5 million. Interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in November 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in December 2010 and a long term debt maturity of $681.8 million in November 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in November 2010, the issuance of $500.0 million of long term debt in November 2011, $400.0 million in June 2011 and $250.0 million in December 2010, and higher average short term borrowings and rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.1 million in other, net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year. Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the Companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the Companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 35.0%, 32.2%, and 41.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2.8% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording $6.8 million in tax expense in the second quarter, and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. The effect of the rate settlements also was the primary 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2009, 2010 and 2011, and estimates for 2012. 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 Gas Distribution Operations $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 431.6 301.5 302.0 287.4 Electric Operations 413.6 267.7 190.3 162.6 Corporate and Other Operations 21.8 22.0 9.6 5.4 Total $ 1,400.0 $ 1,130.6 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 For 2012, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,400.0 million, which is $269.4 million higher than the 2011 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, were $3,462.7 million, a $22.2 million increase compared with 2010. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $56.4 million and increased Electric Operations net revenues of $7.6 million partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $21.3 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues increased primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during 2010. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were $3,440.5 million, a $106.9 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $113.1 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues were higher primarily as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, operating revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,572.2 million in 2011, an increase of $22.4 million from the comparable 2010 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of $59.2 million, higher impairment charges of $14.8 million and increased other taxes of $7.3 million. The increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of $14.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to Lake Erie Land. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case. Operating expenses were $2,549.8 million in 2010, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable 2009 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $36.0 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, and lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $14.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $0.4 million compared with 2010. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010 compared to $16.0 million in 2009. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2011 reduced income $438.0 million compared to a reduction of $485.2 million in 2010. The increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $42.8 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Also, there was a decrease in interest expense of $15.5 million. Interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in November 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in December 2010 and a long term debt maturity of $681.8 million in November 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in November 2010, the issuance of $500.0 million of long term debt in November 2011, $400.0 million in June 2011 and $250.0 million in December 2010, and higher average short term borrowings and rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.1 million in other, net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year. Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the Companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the Companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 35.0%, 32.2%, and 41.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2.8% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording $6.8 million in tax expense in the second quarter, and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. The effect of the rate settlements also was the primary 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2009, 2010 and 2011, and estimates for 2012. 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 Gas Distribution Operations $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 431.6 301.5 302.0 287.4 Electric Operations 413.6 267.7 190.3 162.6 Corporate and Other Operations 21.8 22.0 9.6 5.4 Total $ 1,400.0 $ 1,130.6 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 For 2012, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,400.0 million, which is $269.4 million higher than the 2011 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, were $3,462.7 million, a $22.2 million increase compared with 2010. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $56.4 million and increased Electric Operations net revenues of $7.6 million partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $21.3 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues increased primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during 2010. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were $3,440.5 million, a $106.9 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $113.1 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues were higher primarily as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, operating revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,572.2 million in 2011, an increase of $22.4 million from the comparable 2010 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of $59.2 million, higher impairment charges of $14.8 million and increased other taxes of $7.3 million. The increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of $14.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to Lake Erie Land. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case. Operating expenses were $2,549.8 million in 2010, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable 2009 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $36.0 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, and lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $14.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $0.4 million compared with 2010. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010 compared to $16.0 million in 2009. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2011 reduced income $438.0 million compared to a reduction of $485.2 million in 2010. The increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $42.8 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Also, there was a decrease in interest expense of $15.5 million. Interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in November 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in December 2010 and a long term debt maturity of $681.8 million in November 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in November 2010, the issuance of $500.0 million of long term debt in November 2011, $400.0 million in June 2011 and $250.0 million in December 2010, and higher average short term borrowings and rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.1 million in other, net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year. Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the Companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the Companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 35.0%, 32.2%, and 41.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2.8% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording $6.8 million in tax expense in the second quarter, and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. The effect of the rate settlements also was the primary 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2009, 2010 and 2011, and estimates for 2012. 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 Gas Distribution Operations $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 431.6 301.5 302.0 287.4 Electric Operations 413.6 267.7 190.3 162.6 Corporate and Other Operations 21.8 22.0 9.6 5.4 Total $ 1,400.0 $ 1,130.6 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 For 2012, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,400.0 million, which is $269.4 million higher than the 2011 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012.

The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment.

Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

Net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization). NiSource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, were $3,462.7 million, a $22.2 million increase compared with 2010. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $56.4 million and increased Electric Operations net revenues of $7.6 million partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $21.3 million. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues increased primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during 2010. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were $3,440.5 million, a $106.9 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $113.1 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues were higher primarily as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, operating revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,572.2 million in 2011, an increase of $22.4 million from the comparable 2010 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of $59.2 million, higher impairment charges of $14.8 million and increased other taxes of $7.3 million. The increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of $14.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to Lake Erie Land. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case. Operating expenses were $2,549.8 million in 2010, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable 2009 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $36.0 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, and lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $14.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $0.4 million compared with 2010. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010 compared to $16.0 million in 2009. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2011 reduced income $438.0 million compared to a reduction of $485.2 million in 2010. The increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $42.8 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Also, there was a decrease in interest expense of $15.5 million. Interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in November 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in December 2010 and a long term debt maturity of $681.8 million in November 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in November 2010, the issuance of $500.0 million of long term debt in November 2011, $400.0 million in June 2011 and $250.0 million in December 2010, and higher average short term borrowings and rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.1 million in other, net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year. Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the Companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the Companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 35.0%, 32.2%, and 41.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2.8% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording $6.8 million in tax expense in the second quarter, and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. The effect of the rate settlements also was the primary 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2009, 2010 and 2011, and estimates for 2012. 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 Gas Distribution Operations $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 431.6 301.5 302.0 287.4 Electric Operations 413.6 267.7 190.3 162.6 Corporate and Other Operations 21.8 22.0 9.6 5.4 Total $ 1,400.0 $ 1,130.6 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 For 2012, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,400.0 million, which is $269.4 million higher than the 2011 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million.

Existing resources are expected to be sufficient, assuming favorable outcomes for environmental upgrades, to meet customers needs for the next decade. Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 25.3 $ 28.0 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 Maintenance and Other 388.3 239.7 164.5 129.9 Total $ 413.6 $ 267.7 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 were higher by $77.4 million versus 2010. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations net revenues increased primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 were $3,440.5 million, a $106.9 million increase compared with 2009. Net revenues increased primarily due to increased Electric Operations net revenues of $113.1 million and increased Gas Transmission and Storage Operations operating revenues of $18.5 million, partially offset by lower Gas Distribution Operations net revenues of $6.9 million. Electric Operations net revenues were higher primarily as a result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. Within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations, operating revenues increased primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. Gas Distribution Operations net revenues decreased primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. Expenses Operating expenses were $2,572.2 million in 2011, an increase of $22.4 million from the comparable 2010 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of $59.2 million, higher impairment charges of $14.8 million and increased other taxes of $7.3 million. The increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at Gas Transmission and Storage Operations. As provided by its rate cases, GAAP pension 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of $14.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to Lake Erie Land. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case. Operating expenses were $2,549.8 million in 2010, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable 2009 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $36.0 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, and lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $14.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $0.4 million compared with 2010. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010 compared to $16.0 million in 2009. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2011 reduced income $438.0 million compared to a reduction of $485.2 million in 2010. The increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $42.8 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Also, there was a decrease in interest expense of $15.5 million. Interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in November 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in December 2010 and a long term debt maturity of $681.8 million in November 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in November 2010, the issuance of $500.0 million of long term debt in November 2011, $400.0 million in June 2011 and $250.0 million in December 2010, and higher average short term borrowings and rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.1 million in other, net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year. Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the Companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the Companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 35.0%, 32.2%, and 41.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2.8% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording $6.8 million in tax expense in the second quarter, and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. The effect of the rate settlements also was the primary 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt.

On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012.

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet.

Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the Companys MGP sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers. Higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of $14.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to Lake Erie Land. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58.9 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at Northern Indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case. Operating expenses were $2,549.8 million in 2010, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable 2009 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $36.0 million in payroll and benefits expense, an increase of $20.0 million in maintenance costs, including integrity management pipeline costs, and an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of $27.2 million, lower impairment charges of $21.3 million, and lower uncollectible costs of $12.8 million. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $14.6 million in 2011, a decrease of $0.4 million compared with 2010. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates includes investments in Millennium and Hardy Storage which are integral to the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations business. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium. Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were $15.0 million in 2010 compared to $16.0 million in 2009. Equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. Other Income (Deductions) Other Income (Deductions) in 2011 reduced income $438.0 million compared to a reduction of $485.2 million in 2010. The increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $42.8 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Also, there was a decrease in interest expense of $15.5 million. Interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in November 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in December 2010 and a long term debt maturity of $681.8 million in November 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in November 2010, the issuance of $500.0 million of long term debt in November 2011, $400.0 million in June 2011 and $250.0 million in December 2010, and higher average short term borrowings and rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $11.1 million in other, net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year. Other Income (Deductions) in 2010 reduced income $485.2 million compared to a reduction of $405.2 million in 2009. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $96.7 million loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $7.0 million. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the $681.8 million November 2010 long term debt maturity, the $385.0 million December 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the Companys $417.6 million November 2009 floating rate note, and lower short term interest rates. The interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long term debt in December 2010, the issuance of the $500.0 million December 2009 long term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the Companys accounts receivable facilities. Additionally, other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 35.0%, 32.2%, and 41.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2.8% increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in Indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording $6.8 million in tax expense in the second quarter, and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates. The effect of the rate settlements also was the primary 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2009, 2010 and 2011, and estimates for 2012. 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 Gas Distribution Operations $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 431.6 301.5 302.0 287.4 Electric Operations 413.6 267.7 190.3 162.6 Corporate and Other Operations 21.8 22.0 9.6 5.4 Total $ 1,400.0 $ 1,130.6 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 For 2012, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,400.0 million, which is $269.4 million higher than the 2011 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia.

Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Existing resources are expected to be sufficient, assuming favorable outcomes for environmental upgrades, to meet customers needs for the next decade. Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 25.3 $ 28.0 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 Maintenance and Other 388.3 239.7 164.5 129.9 Total $ 413.6 $ 267.7 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 were higher by $77.4 million versus 2010. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. cause of the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010. Moreover, in 2009 the Company recorded the impact of certain nondeductible expenses, which increased tax expense $5.3 million and additional deferred income tax expense of $9.7 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes. On May 12, 2011, the governor of Indiana signed into law House Bill 1004, which among other things, lowers the corporate income tax rate from 8.5% to 6.5% over four years beginning on July 1, 2012. The reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process. In addition, other deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax assets related to Indiana net operating loss carry forward, will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized. In the second quarter 2011, NiSource recorded tax expense of $6.8 million to reflect the effect of this rate change. The expense is largely attributable to the re measurement of the Indiana net operating loss at the 6.5% rate. The majority of the Companys tax temporary differences are related to Northern Indianas utility plant. The re measurement of these temporary differences at 6.5% was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset. On August 19, 2011, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2011 43, which provided a safe harbor method that taxpayers may use to determine whether certain expenditures related to electric transmission and distribution assets must be capitalized. This Revenue Procedure provided procedures for obtaining automatic consent from the IRS to adopt the safe harbor method for the first or second taxable year beginning after December 30, 2010. NiSource changed its method of tax accounting related to certain expenditures, including those related to electric transmission and distribution assets in 2008. As a result of the issuance of the Revenue Procedure, NiSource revised its estimates and recorded tax benefits of $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. During the third quarter of 2009, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year. Under the new tax accounting method, NiSource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of $295.7 million. In October 2009, $263.5 million of these refunds were received. The remaining refunds were received in December 2009 and throughout 2010. The loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in $1.2 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of Section 199 deductions. The impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of $5.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource received permission from the IRS to change its method of accounting for capitalized overhead costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. The change is effective for the 2009 tax year. The Company recorded a net long term receivable of $31.5 million, net of uncertain tax positions, in the fourth quarter of 2010 to reflect this change. There was no material impact on the effective tax rate as a result of this method change. In 2011, the Company revised its calculation related to the change in method and recorded an increase to the net long term receivable of $3.3 million, net of uncertain tax positions, to reflect the change in estimate. Excluding minor amounts of interest, the revision of estimate did not impact total income tax expense. In the third quarter of 2010, NiSource recorded a $15.2 million reduction to income tax expense in connection with the Pennsylvania PUC approval of the Columbia of Pennsylvania base rate case settlement on August 18, 2010. The adjustment to income tax expense resulted from the settlement agreement to flow through in current rates the tax benefits related to a tax accounting method change for certain capitalized costs approved by the IRS. As a result of the Pennsylvania Commission Order on October 14, 2011, Columbia of Pennsylvania will continue to flow through in rates unamortized tax benefits of approximately $30 million through January 2014 related to the unit of property tax method change. The amortization of excess tax benefits was $6.0 million in 2011. On a prospective basis, Columbia of Pennsylvania will recognize deferred tax expense rather than flow through in rates the tax benefits resulting from this method change. The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes requires the impact of a change in 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2009, 2010 and 2011, and estimates for 2012. 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 Gas Distribution Operations $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 431.6 301.5 302.0 287.4 Electric Operations 413.6 267.7 190.3 162.6 Corporate and Other Operations 21.8 22.0 9.6 5.4 Total $ 1,400.0 $ 1,130.6 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 For 2012, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,400.0 million, which is $269.4 million higher than the 2011 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates.

Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service.

International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012.

The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Existing resources are expected to be sufficient, assuming favorable outcomes for environmental upgrades, to meet customers needs for the next decade. Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012.

The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment.

Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations reflected a loss of $4.7 million, or $0.02 loss per basic share, in 2011, a loss of $2.6 million, or $0.01 loss per basic share, in 2010, and a loss of $12.8 million, or $0.05 loss per basic share, in 2009. The losses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 include activities associated with CER, and other former subsidiaries where NiSource has retained certain liabilities, as well as for impairment charges in 2009 associated with certain properties to be sold by NDC Douglas Properties. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of NiSources operations, most notably in the gas distribution, gas transportation and electric businesses, are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. During the heating season, which is primarily from November through March, cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements. During the summer months, cash on hand, together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external short term and long term financing, is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities. NiSource believes that through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under its short term revolver, commercial paper program, long term debt agreements and NiSources ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2012. Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $870.2 million, an increase of $144.8 million from a year ago. During 2011, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $127.5 million source of working capital related to under recovered gas costs. The $219.6 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011. These sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $141.8 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate. Additionally, there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of $154.8 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in December 2011 compared to December 2010. Net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $725.4 million, a decrease of $940.8 million from the prior year. During 2010, the refunding of the 2009 over recovered gas costs resulted in a $243.0 million use of working capital. During 2009, gas price decreases and the collection of the 2008 under recovered gas cost resulted in a $323.4 million source of working capital. Although there were no changes in the operation of the accounts receivable securitization programs, the application of new accounting guidance, ASC 860, attributed to substantially all of the $243.9 million use of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2010. Furthermore, higher gas prices and volumes attributed to the higher than normal accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 creating a $258.9 million source of working capital when collected in 2009. This same pricing and volume scenario contributed to higher than normal accounts payable at December 31, 2008, resulting in a $191.4 million use of working capital when paid in 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2011, NiSource contributed $393.5 million to its pension plans and $53.6 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. At December 31, 2011, NiSources pension and other post retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $472.9 million and $456.5 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Investing Activities The tables below reflect actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2009, 2010 and 2011, and estimates for 2012. 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 Gas Distribution Operations $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 Gas Transmission and Storage Operations 431.6 301.5 302.0 287.4 Electric Operations 413.6 267.7 190.3 162.6 Corporate and Other Operations 21.8 22.0 9.6 5.4 Total $ 1,400.0 $ 1,130.6 $ 911.6 $ 798.6 For 2012, the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be $1,400.0 million, which is $269.4 million higher than the 2011 capital program. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service.

International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Existing resources are expected to be sufficient, assuming favorable outcomes for environmental upgrades, to meet customers needs for the next decade. Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet.

Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet in the Electric Operations segment and increased expenditures at the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment for integrity management pipeline spending and planned pipeline replacements. The program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, equity, and short term debt. For 2011, the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,130.6 million, an increase of $219.0 million compared to 2010. This increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment and increased growth expenditures in the Electric Operations segment which is primarily due to the FGD project. For 2010, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $911.6 million, an increase of $113.0 million compared to 2009. A significant amount of the increase was due to increased capital expenditures within Gas Distribution Operations of $66.5 million, due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Additionally, capital expenditures increased within Electric Operations and Gas Transmission and Storage Operations by $27.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The increase within Electric Operations was the result of maintenance spending on generation, distribution, and transmission projects. The increase within Gas Transmission and Storage Operations was primarily due to higher expenditures on maintenance projects. Restricted cash was $160.6 million and $202.9 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in restricted cash was a result of the settlement of positions at MF Global as a result of MF Global filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Additionally, restricted cash decreased due to the winding down of NiSources unregulated natural gas marketing business. NiSource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of $5.0 million and $62.7 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2010 and 2009, respectively. No insurance proceeds for capital repairs were received in 2011. Contributions to equity investees were $6.4 million, $87.9 million, and $26.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2010 was the result of cash required for Millenniums long term debt refinancing. Financing Activities Long term Debt. Refer to Note 16, Long term Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on long term debt. Credit Facilities. On March 3, 2011, NiSource Finance entered into a new $1.5 billion four year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Barclays Capital. The new facility replaced an existing $1.5 billion five year credit facility which would have expired during July 2011. The purpose of the new facility is to fund ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including supporting liquidity for the Companys commercial paper program, and provides for the issuance of letters of credit. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2011 and their maturities were: (in millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After Long term debt (a) $ 6,569.7 $ 315.8 $ 489.2 $ 557.8 $ 230.1 $ 421.5 $ 4,555.3 Capital leases (b) 147.8 14.3 12.8 12.5 12.2 9.9 86.1 Interest payments on long term debt 3,803.3 392.7 354.0 334.8 369.2 289.1 2,063.5 Operating leases 162.0 41.2 34.0 29.1 19.0 14.1 24.6 Energy commodity contracts 582.4 239.3 130.4 120.2 85.1 1.5 5.9 Service obligations: Pipeline service obligations 1,493.3 256.9 225.3 185.7 138.9 121.3 565.2 IBM service obligations 271.9 78.4 77.4 75.1 35.8 3.4 1.8 Vertex Outsourcing LLC service obligations 42.6 12.3 12.2 12.1 6.0 Other service obligations 373.5 132.2 82.0 78.3 81.0 Other liabilities 55.0 55.0 Total contractual obligations $ 13,501.5 $ 1,538.1 $ 1,417.3 $ 1,405.6 $ 977.3 $ 860.8 $ 7,302.4 (a) Long term debt balance excludes unamortized discounts of $37.4 million and non recourse debt of $11.3 million related to NDC Douglas Properties. (b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service.

International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The plan evaluates demand side and supply side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet Northern Indiana customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years. Existing resources are expected to be sufficient, assuming favorable outcomes for environmental upgrades, to meet customers needs for the next decade. Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 25.3 $ 28.0 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 Maintenance and Other 388.3 239.7 164.5 129.9 Total $ 413.6 $ 267.7 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 were higher by $77.4 million versus 2010. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. During June 2011, NiSource Finance implemented a new commercial paper program with a program limit of up to $500.0 million with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. Commercial paper issuances are supported by available capacity under NiSource Finances $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in March 2015. NiSource Finance had outstanding credit facility borrowings of $725.0 million at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.99%, and borrowings of $1,107.5 million at December 31, 2010, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. In addition, NiSource Finance had $402.7 million in commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.01%. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $231.7 million and $275.0 million, respectively, of short term borrowings recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash from financing activities in the same amount relating to its accounts receivable securitization facilities. See Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, NiSource had $37.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of stand by letters of credit outstanding of which $19.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $353.1 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. Forward Agreements. On September 14, 2010, NiSource and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as forward seller, closed an underwritten registered public offering of 24,265,000 shares of NiSources common stock. All of the shares sold were borrowed and delivered to the underwriters by the forward seller. NiSource did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares, but NiSource will receive proceeds upon settlement of the Forward Agreements. If the equity forward had been settled by delivery of shares at December 31, 2011, the Company would have received approximately $357.2 million based on a forward price of $14.7224 for the 24,265,000 shares. The Company currently anticipates settling the equity forward by delivering shares in 2012. Debt Covenants. NiSource is subject to one financial covenant under its four year revolving credit facility. This covenant requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires NiSource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2011, the ratio was 61.4%. NiSource is also subject to certain other non financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $150 million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, lease and or transfer of NiSources assets to no more than 10% of its consolidated total assets and dispositions for a price not materially less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of that do not impair the ability of NiSource and NiSource Finance to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that, together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of NiSource or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount of $50 million or more. NiSources indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, NiSources indentures are generally subject to cross default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $5 million to $50 million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on NiSources assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at 10% of NiSources consolidated net tangible assets. Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 19, Transfers of Financial Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable. Credit Ratings. On December 13, 2011, Fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at BBB , and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Fitchs outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On November 18, 2011, Moodys Investors Service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource at Baa3, and the 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing.

(b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Existing resources are expected to be sufficient, assuming favorable outcomes for environmental upgrades, to meet customers needs for the next decade. Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 25.3 $ 28.0 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 Maintenance and Other 388.3 239.7 164.5 129.9 Total $ 413.6 $ 267.7 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 were higher by $77.4 million versus 2010. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. existing ratings of all other subsidiaries. Moodys outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. On February 24, 2011, Standard & Poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for NiSource and its subsidiaries at BBB . Standard & Poors outlook for NiSource and all of its subsidiaries is stable. Although all ratings continue to be investment grade, a downgrade by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade. Certain NiSource affiliates have agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of NiSource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below BBB by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. The collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $21.0 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. Under Northern Indianas trade receivables sales program, an event of termination occurs if Northern Indianas debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys or falls below BB or Ba2 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Likewise, under Columbia of Ohios and Columbia of Pennsylvanias trade receivables sales programs, an event of termination occurs if NiSources debt rating is withdrawn by either Standard & Poors or Moodys, or falls below BB or Ba3 at either Standard & Poors or Moodys, respectively. Contractual Obligations. NiSource has certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and service obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and IBM outsourcing.

(b) Capital leases payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $58.4 million. Also included are minimum lease payments for an office building that the Company will not occupy until 2014. NiSource calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows: for the fixed rate debt, interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates; for variable rate debt, interest rates are used that are in place as of December 31, 2011. For 2012, NiSource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately $425.9 million, which includes $392.7 million of interest payments related to its long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, NiSource also had $1,359.4 million in short term borrowings outstanding. NiSource Corporate Services has a license agreement with Rational Systems, LLC for pipeline business software requiring annual payments of $5.8 million, which is recorded as a capital lease. NiSources subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantities of these commodities NiSource is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. In July 2008, the IURC issued an order approving Northern Indianas purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of Iberdrola Renewables, Buffalo Ridge I LLC and Barton Windpower LLC. These agreements provide Northern Indiana the opportunity and obligation to purchase up to 100 mw of wind power commencing in early 2009. The 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012.

Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. contracts extend 15 and 20 years, representing 50 mw of wind power each. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity production from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon any termination of the agreements by Northern Indiana for any reason (other than material breach by Buffalo Ridge I LLC or Barton Windpower LLC), Northern Indiana may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. Northern Indiana began purchasing wind power in April 2009. NiSource has pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2045, require NiSource to pay fixed monthly charges. NiSource Corporate Services continues to pay IBM to provide business process and support functions to NiSource for amended services under a combination of fixed or variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the actual need for such services. Under the amended agreement, at December 31, 2011, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $272 million to IBM in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. In December 2011, NiSource elected to extend certain information technology services. Upon any termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason, other than material breach by IBM, NiSource may be required to pay IBM a termination charge that could include a breakage fee, repayment of IBMs unrecovered capital investments, and IBM wind down expense. This termination fee could be a material amount depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. NiSource Corporate Services signed a service agreement with Vertex Outsourcing LLC, a business process outsourcing company, to provide customer contact center services for NiSource subsidiaries through June 2015. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 2008, and NiSource Corporate Services pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on actual need for such services. Based on the currently projected usage of these services, NiSource Corporate Services expects to pay approximately $42.6 million to Vertex Outsourcing LLC in service fees over the remaining three and a half year term. Upon termination of the agreement by NiSource for any reason (other than material breach by Vertex Outsourcing LLC), NiSource may be required to pay a termination charge not to exceed $10.8 million. Northern Indiana has contracts with four major rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through 2015 and are included within Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. Northern Indiana has a service agreement with Pure Air, a general partnership between Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and First Air Partners LP, under which Pure Air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for Units 7 and 8 at the Bailly Generating Station. Services under this contract commenced on July 1, 1992, and Northern Indiana pays for the services under a combination of fixed and variable charges. The agreement provides that, assuming various performance standards are met by Pure Air, a termination payment would be due if Northern Indiana terminated the agreement prior to the end of the twenty year contract period. Estimated minimum payments for this agreement are included within, Other service obligations, in the table of contractual obligations. With the expiration of this contract occurring on June 30, 2012, Northern Indiana is currently evaluating long term strategic options, including negotiations to renew this contract. NiSources expected payments included within Other liabilities, in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2012. Plan contributions beyond 2012 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated. In 2012, NiSource expects to make contributions of approximately $3.3 million to its pension plans and approximately $51.7 million to its postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Not included in the table above are $4.8 million of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities, including interest. If or when such amounts may be settled is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service.

International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Existing resources are expected to be sufficient, assuming favorable outcomes for environmental upgrades, to meet customers needs for the next decade. Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 25.3 $ 28.0 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 Maintenance and Other 388.3 239.7 164.5 129.9 Total $ 413.6 $ 267.7 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 were higher by $77.4 million versus 2010. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. In the fourth quarter of 2008, NiSource received final approval by the West Virginia Circuit Court for Roane County regarding a settlement agreement regarding the Tawney proceeding. NiSources share of the settlement liability was $338.8 million. NiSource complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement to fund $85.5 million in the qualified settlement fund by January 13, 2009. Additionally, NiSource provided a letter of credit on January 13, 2009 in the amount of $254.0 million and thereby complied with its obligation to secure the unpaid portion of the settlement. As of December 31, 2010, NiSource had contributed a total of $330.5 million into the qualified settlement fund. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource had fully paid the settlement liability. NiSource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long term obligations classified as, Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above. NiSource also has obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately $322.7 million in 2012, which are not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Items As a part of normal business, NiSource and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand by letters of credit. NiSource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately $148 million of commodity related payments for its current and former subsidiaries involved in energy marketing activities. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity. To the extent liabilities exist under the commodity related contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NiSource has purchase and sales agreement guarantees totaling $250 million, which guarantee performance of the sellers covenants, agreements, obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sales agreement guarantees are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management believes that the likelihood NiSource would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. NiSource has other guarantees outstanding. Refer to Note 20 A, Guarantees and Indemnities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about NiSources off balance sheet arrangements. Market Risk Disclosures Risk is an inherent part of NiSources energy businesses. The extent to which NiSource properly and effectively identifies, assesses, monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability. NiSource seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in NiSources energy businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management at NiSource is a multi faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. NiSources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, NiSources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor NiSources market and credit risks, including VaR. VaR represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment.

Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Commodity Price Risk NiSource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, NiSources subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. NiSource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity. Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at NiSources rate regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. Some of NiSources rate regulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products. These subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. All derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness, with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate. During 2011 and 2010, no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges. During 2009, NiSource reclassified $126.4 million ($75.1 million, net of tax) related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that NiSource had planned to sell. NiSource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource recorded a reserve of $22.6 million on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business. It is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $0.7 million of loss, net of taxes. Refer to Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on NiSources various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk. NiSource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, which are reflected in NiSources restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets. Interest Rate Risk NiSource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates. NiSource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of long term debt. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $16.5 million and $14.7 million for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the 5.25% notes and 5.45% notes issued September 16, 2005, NiSource Finance settled $900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties. NiSource paid an aggregate settlement payment of $35.5 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.67% and 5.88% respectively. NiSource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding long term debt from fixed to variable. On May 12, 2004, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $660 million with six counterparties having a 6 1/2 year term. NiSource Finance received payments based upon a fixed 7.875% interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 3.08% per annum. On September 15, 2008, as a result of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy filing the previous day, NiSource Finance terminated a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with Lehman Brothers having a notional amount of $110.0 million. On November 15, 2010, the term of the remaining $550.0 million of interest rate swaps expired, and the swaps were terminated. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012.

Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 25.3 $ 28.0 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 Maintenance and Other 388.3 239.7 164.5 129.9 Total $ 413.6 $ 267.7 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 were higher by $77.4 million versus 2010. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK NISOURCE INC. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk are reported in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Risk Disclosures. 63 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. On July 22, 2003, NiSource Finance entered into fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of $500 million with four counterparties with an 11 year term. NiSource Finance receives payments based upon a fixed 5.40% interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on U.S. 6 month BBA LIBOR plus an average of 0.78% per annum. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps. In addition, each party has the right to cancel the swaps on July 15, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, $500.0 million of NiSource Finances existing long term debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixed to variable interest rate swap transactions. Credit Risk Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of NiSources business activities. NiSources extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For forward commodity contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to NiSource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support. NiSource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties. NiSource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of market based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. On October 31, 2011, cash and derivatives broker dealer MF Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MF Global brokered NYMEX hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of NiSource affiliates. At the date of bankruptcy, NiSource affiliates had contracts open with MF Global with settlement dates ranging from November 2011 to February 2014. On November 3, 2011, these contracts were measured at a mark to market loss of approximately $46.4 million. NiSource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of $6.9 million and additional maintenance margin for mark to market losses, for a total cash balance of $53.3 million. Within the first week after the filing, at the direction of the Bankruptcy Court, a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of NiSource affiliates to a court designated replacement broker for future trade activity. The existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of November 3, 2011. Initial margin on deposit at MF Global of $5.7 million was transferred to the court designated replacement broker. The maintenance margin was retained by MF Global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on November 3, 2011. NiSource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the Courts direction. As of December 31, 2011, NiSource affiliates reserved the $1.2 million difference between the initial margin posted with MF Global and the cash transferred to the court designated replacement broker as a loss contingency. Fair Value Measurement NiSource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NiSources financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities, available for sale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation. Exchange traded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. Certain non exchange traded derivatives are valued using broker or over the counter, on line exchanges. In such cases, these non exchange traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non exchange based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. NiSource uses a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 25.3 $ 28.0 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 Maintenance and Other 388.3 239.7 164.5 129.9 Total $ 413.6 $ 267.7 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 were higher by $77.4 million versus 2010. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability, and market corroborated inputs, i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized in Level 3. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures. Price risk management assets also include fixed to floating interest rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, as a means to achieve its targeted level of variable rate debt as a percent of total debt. NiSource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements, which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility. As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap. Refer to Note 18, Fair Value Disclosures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on NiSources fair value measurements. Market Risk Measurement Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio. NiSource calculates a one day VaR at a 95% confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variance/covariance methodology. The daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average, high and low basis was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and zero during 2011, respectively. Prospectively, management has set the VaR limit at $0.8 million for gas marketing. Exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies included in this Item 7 and Note 1 U, Accounting for Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, and Note 9, Risk Management and Energy Marketing Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of NiSources risk management. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies NiSource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on NiSources results of operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Basis of Accounting for Rate Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,147.9 million and $1,775.9 million at December 31, 2011, and $1,791.8 million and $1,688.7 million at December 31, 2010, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for NiSource to recover its costs in the future, all or a portion of NiSources regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write down of all or a portion of NiSources existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, NiSource would 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 25.3 $ 28.0 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 Maintenance and Other 388.3 239.7 164.5 129.9 Total $ 413.6 $ 267.7 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 were higher by $77.4 million versus 2010. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980 20, Discontinuation of Rate Regulated Accounting. In managements opinion, NiSources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future. Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, NiSource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $147.5 million at December 31, 2011. If NiSource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts. Accounting for Risk Management Activities. Under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), earnings, or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives. For subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. As a result of the rate making process, the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows. These gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although NiSource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks. NiSource generally uses NYMEX exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses. NiSource had $348.5 million and $399.8 million of price risk management assets, of which $56.7 million and $61.1 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $306.7 million and $355.5 million of price risk management liabilities, of which $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to hedges, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. NiSource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. For further discussion of NiSources pensions and other postretirement benefits see Note 12, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill. NiSources goodwill assets at December 31, 2011 were $3,677.3 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. In addition, Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations goodwill assets at December 31, 2011, related to the purchase of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light in March 1993 and Kokomo Gas in February 1992, were $18.8 million. As required, NiSource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. NiSources annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of June 30, 2011. The goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach. In performing the goodwill test, NiSource made certain required key assumptions, such as long term growth rates, discount rates and fair market values. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012.

Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Existing resources are expected to be sufficient, assuming favorable outcomes for environmental upgrades, to meet customers needs for the next decade. Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 25.3 $ 28.0 $ 25.8 $ 32.7 Maintenance and Other 388.3 239.7 164.5 129.9 Total $ 413.6 $ 267.7 $ 190.3 $ 162.6 The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2011 were higher by $77.4 million versus 2010. The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. These key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forward looking in nature. To assist in making these judgments, NiSource utilized third party valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis. NiSource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. NiSource used discount rates of 6.00% for both Columbia Transmission Operations and Columbia Distribution Operations, resulting in excess fair values of approximately $1,092 million and $412 million, respectively. The results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test. Goodwill at Northern Indiana Gas Distribution Operations related to the acquisition of Northern Indiana Fuel and Light and Kokomo Gas of $18.8 million was also tested for impairment as of June 30, 2011. The income approach was used to determine the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas Distribution reporting unit. Key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 6.00% and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations. These cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives. The step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the Northern Indiana Gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by $319 million. Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of June 30, 2011, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if NiSources market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 1 J and 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Long lived Asset Impairment Testing. NiSources Consolidated Balance Sheets contain long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. As a result, NiSource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired. When an assets carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying value. Refer to Note 1 K, Long lived Assets, and Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Contingencies. A contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental, tax, legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. Accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability. Estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available, including present laws and regulations. Managements assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available. Actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on NiSources results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 20, Other Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asset Retirement Obligations. Entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. In the absence of quoted market prices, fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques, using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free rates. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The rate regulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected, or expected to be collected, in rates. Refer to Note 7, Asset Retirement Obligations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered. Utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed. Taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates. Additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes. Regulatory assets or liabilities, corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities, may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process. Amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards In December 2011, the SEC Chief Accountant, and in January 2012, the SEC Chairman both indicated that a determination on IFRS would be made in the next few months. In February 2010, the SEC expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of IFRS for the U.S. In October 2010, the SEC staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in May 2011, a Staff Paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system, as opposed to a single date approach, if the SEC were to decide that incorporation of IFRS is in the best interest of U.S. investors. Under this possible framework, IFRS would be incorporated into GAAP during a transition period (e.g., five to seven years) and the FASB would be retained as the United States standard setter. The SEC staff issued its third report on IFRS in November 2011, detailing an analysis of IFRS in practice. In the fourth quarter of 2010, NiSource completed a comprehensive assessment of IFRS to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to U.S. GAAP and to assess the potential organizational, process and system impacts that would be required. The accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS are complex and significant in many aspects, and conversion to IFRS would have broad impacts across NiSource. In addition to financial statement and disclosure changes, converting to IFRS would involve changes to processes and controls, regulatory and management reporting, financial reporting systems, and other areas of the organization. As a part of the IFRS assessment project, a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting IFRS. This IFRS conversion roadmap, and NiSources strategy for addressing a potential mandate of IFRS, will be re assessed when the SEC makes its determination on whether to require the use of IFRS and by what method. Environmental Matters NiSource is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. NiSource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to NiSources business and operations. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters. Bargaining Unit Contract As of December 31, 2011 NiSource had 7,957 employees of whom 3,295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011. Ten additional collective bargaining contracts, covering approximately 513 employees, are set to expire during 2012. To date, an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts. The remaining nine agreements, covering approximately 437 employees, expire between March 1, 2012 and June 18, 2012. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Existing resources are expected to be sufficient, assuming favorable outcomes for environmental upgrades, to meet customers needs for the next decade. Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012.

The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. 2010 Health Care Act The 2010 Health Care Act includes a provision eliminating, effective January 1, 2013, the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the Retiree Drug Subsidy program. When the Retiree Drug Subsidy was created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, NiSource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future Retiree Drug Subsidy from taxable income. At the same time, an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect NiSources obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date. In the first quarter of 2010, NiSource reversed its deferred tax asset of $6.2 million related to previously excludable Retiree Drug Subsidy payments expected to be received after January 1, 2013, which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability. There was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income for the period ended December 31, 2010. A provision of the 2010 Health Care Act requires the elimination, effective January 1, 2011, of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans. The NiSource Consolidated Flex Medical Plan (the Consolidated Flex Plan), a component welfare benefit plan of the NiSource Life and Medical Benefits Program, covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees. NiSource examined the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of March 31, 2010. Effective September 1, 2010, NiSource amended the Consolidated Flex Plan and established the NiSource Post 65 Retiree Medical Plan (the Post 65 Retiree Plan) as a separate ERISA plan. In accordance with the amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan, Medicare supplement plan options for NiSource post age 65 retirees and their eligible post age 65 dependents are now offered under the Post 65 Retiree Plan, a retiree only plan, and not under the Consolidated Flex Plan. The Post 65 Retiree Plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 Health Care Act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits. The amendment of the Consolidated Flex Plan and the establishment of the Post 65 Retiree Plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of September 1, 2010. The effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of $31.0 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and AOCI of $29.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately $2.2 million. Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010 and was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Act, among other things, establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments, as well as the protection of consumers. The FSOC may submit comments to the SEC and any standard setting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle, standard or procedure. The Act also creates increased oversight of the over the counter derivative market, requiring certain OTC transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions. Some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the Act over the next six months. NiSource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the Act. Although the Act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally, NiSource does not expect the Act to have any material effect on its operations. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NISOURCE INC. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Presentation of Segment Information Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The NiSource Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker. NiSources operations are divided into three primary business segments. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Indiana and Massachusetts. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012.

Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012.

The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions.

Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost, coal fired generation. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, similar gas provider competition is also common. Gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the Massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which, over time, has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 82.5 $ 81.5 $ 94.1 $ 86.1 Maintenance and Other 450.5 457.9 315.6 257.1 Total $ 533.0 $ 539.4 $ 409.7 $ 343.2 The Gas Distribution Operations segments capital expenditures and other investing activities were $539.4 million in 2011 and are projected to be $533.0 million in 2012. Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012.

Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet.

Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Market Conditions During 2011, Gas Distribution Operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year. Spot prices at the Henry Hub for the winter of 2011 2012 have primarily been in the $2.80 $3.70/Dth range compared to prices in the $3.20 $4.70/Dth range experienced during the winter of 2010 2011. Year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 2009 2010 lows, but the combination of strong supplies, unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range. Entering the 2011 2012 winter season, national storage levels were 6 Bcf below the prior year but 215 Bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels (based on 11/10/2011 Energy Information Administration storage report as published in the 11/11/2011 Gas Daily). During the summer of 2011, prices ranged between $3.40 and $4.92/Dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010. All NiSource Gas Distribution Operations companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under recovered or over recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. The Gas Distribution Operations companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies service territory, the sale of products and services in the companies service territories, and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on system services are offered by NiSource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations company system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers. Certain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012.

Capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately $129.7 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. The estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts. Capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately $66.5 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects. Bear Garden Station In August 2008, Columbia of Virginia entered into an agreement with Dominion Virginia Power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in Buckingham County, VA, known as the Bear Garden station. The project required approximately 13.3 miles of 24 inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station. In March 2009, the VSCC approved Dominion Virginia Power Companys planned Bear Garden station. Columbia of Virginias facilities constructed to serve the Bear Garden station were placed into service in July 2010. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Customer Usage. The NiSource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers, due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices. A significant portion of the LDCs operating costs are fixed in nature. Historically, rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput, rather than in a fixed charge. In addition, increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer. Columbia of Ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a de coupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. In regulatory proceedings in 2009, Columbia of Massachusetts and Columbia of Virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor. In its 2011 rate case, Columbia of Pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge. Each of the states in which the NiSource LDCs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges. In its 2010 rate case, Northern Indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design. This rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three Indiana LDCs; Northern Indiana, Kokomo Gas and Northern Indiana Fuel and Light. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Distribution Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Distribution Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Weather In general, NiSource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the NiSource distribution region. While the temperature base for measuring heating degree days (i.e. the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins) varies slightly across the region, the NiSource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees. NiSource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated NiSource composite heating degree day comparison. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2011 was about 4% warmer than normal and was about 2% warmer than 2010, decreasing net revenues by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2010 was about 2% warmer than normal and was about 1% warmer than 2009, decreasing net revenues by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Throughput Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 917.9 MMDth, compared to 883.6 MMDth for 2010. This increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy. NiSource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of Gas Distribution Operations. 53 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Distribution Operations (continued) Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 883.6 MMDth, compared to 831.0 MMDth for 2009. This increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher off system sales. Net Revenues Net revenues for 2011 were $1,581.2 million, a decrease of $21.3 million from the same period in 2010, due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of $51.8 million, which are offset in expense, lower off system sales of $18.8 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at Columbia of Ohio in the second quarter of 2010, and a decrease in industrial margins of $7.6 million. The decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of $30.3 million for other regulatory and service programs, including impacts from the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various NiSource LDCs. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.1 million in residential and commercial margins. Net revenues also increased $5.7 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010, $2.8 million from Bear Garden Station which was placed into service in July of 2010, and $2.5 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010. Net revenues for 2010 were $1,602.5 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from 2009. This decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of $20.4 million, offset in expense, and decreased residential and commercial margins of $20.1 million. Additionally, there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at Columbia of Massachusetts of $5.7 million, additional customer credits of $5.6 million issued as the result of a rate case, a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of $5.0 million, and the impact of warmer weather of approximately $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of $51.7 million. This includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities, the implementation of new rates under Columbia of Ohios approved infrastructure replacement program, and for the revenue normalization program at Columbia of Virginia. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustments to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of $180.3 million and a revenue increase of $270.6 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2011, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $392.8 million, an increase of $60.5 million from the comparable 2010 period. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased $81.8 million as a result of a decrease of $65.3 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at Northern Indiana and $55.0 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers, which are offset in net revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of $25.8 million as a result of the increase in estimated MGP remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of $13.3 million. For 2010, operating income for the Gas Distribution Operations segment was $332.3 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of $12.0 million, partially offset by decreased net revenues described above. Operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers, offset in revenue, of $20.4 million, decreased uncollectible expenses of $10.1 million and lower depreciation costs of $8.8 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of $20.1 million and environmental costs of $3.3 million. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment executed three separate projects totaling approximately $80 million in the Majorsville, PA vicinity to aggregate Marcellus Shale gas production for downstream transmission. Fully contracted, the pipeline and compression assets allow the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment to gather and deliver more than 325,000 Dth per day of Marcellus production gas to the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plants developed by MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources L.L.C. In 2010, Columbia Transmission received approval from the FERC to refunctionalize certain transmission assets to gathering and transferred these pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate, NiSource Midstream Services, LLC. These facilities are included in providing non FERC jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the Majorsville, PA vicinity. Two of the three projects were completed and placed into service on August 1, 2010, creating an integrated gathering and processing system serving Marcellus production in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were superseded by the execution of long term service agreements in August and September 2010. In the fourth quarter, construction began on the third project on a pipeline to deliver residue gas from the Majorsville MarkWest Liberty processing plant to the Texas Eastern Wind Ridge compressor station in southwestern Pennsylvania to provide significant additional capacity to eastern markets. This project was placed into service in April 2011. Clendenin Project. Construction began on this approximately $18 million capital project in 2010 to modify existing facilities in the Clendenin, West Virginia area to move Marcellus production to liquid market centers. The Clendenin project provides the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment the ability to meet incremental transportation demand of up to 150,000 Dth per day. Long term firm transportation contracts for 133,100 Dth have been executed, some of which began in the third quarter 2010 and others that began in June 2011. Cobb Compressor Station Project. This project continued the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment strategy to meet producers near term, incremental transportation demand in the Appalachian Basin. Shippers executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25,500 Dth per day of long term firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at Cobb Compressor Station in Kanawha County, West Virginia. The Cobb Expansion totaled approximately $15 million in construction costs and was placed into service in May 2010. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) East Lateral Project. In 2010, the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment initiated a $5 million project to modify existing facilities on the Columbia Gulf East Lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300,000 Dth per day. Firm transportation contracts for 250,000 Dth per day were executed for five year terms. This FERC approved project was completed and put into service in May 2011. Southern Appalachian Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment invested nearly $4 million to expand Line SM 116 to transport approximately 38,500 Dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of Marcellus and Appalachian gas. This additional capacity is supported by executed, binding precedent agreements. These additional facilities were placed in service in April 2011. Growth Projects in Progress Power Plant Generation Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment is planning to spend nearly $35 million on an expansion project, which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets, with Virginia Power Services Energy Corporation, Inc., the energy manager for Virginia Electric Power Company. This project will expand the Columbia Transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250,000 Dth per day of transportation capacity under a long term, firm contract. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid 2014. Line WB Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment expanded its WB system through investment in additional facilities, which provide transportation service on a firm basis from Loudoun, Virginia to Leach, Kentucky. The expansion totaled approximately $14 million, allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the Marcellus/Appalachian Basin. Binding precedent agreements for approximately 175,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed, some which began in January 2011. Final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012. Smithfield Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment made approximately $14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150,000 Dth per day of additional Marcellus gas from connections near Smithfield, West Virginia and Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Three anchor shippers agreed to long term, firm transportation contracts, one contract that began in April 2011 and others that began in August 2011. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012. Rimersburg Expansion Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $6 million for this project that will add capacity to north central Pennsylvania to meet the growing demands of producers in the area. The project will consist of the expansion of Line 134 from the Brinker compressor station to the Iowa regulator, adding approximately 19,000 Dth per day of additional capacity, all of which has been sold through precedent agreements. The project is expected to go into service in the first quarter of 2012. Pennsylvania Marcellus Pipeline Project. The Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment has approved an investment of approximately $150 million, which will include right of way acquisitions and constructing new pipeline with an initial combined capacity of 300,000 Dth per day. Natural gas will initially be sourced from a new third party processing plant and delivered to Columbia Transmission and two other third party pipelines in Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be placed in service in late 2012. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on regulatory matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) (in millions) 2012E 2011 2010 2009 System Growth $ 221.0 $ 81.5 $ 152.4 $ 171.2 Maintenance and Other 210.6 220.0 149.6 116.2 Total $ 431.6 $ 301.5 $ 302.0 $ 287.4 Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2011 decreased by $0.5 million relative to 2010. The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Existing resources are expected to be sufficient, assuming favorable outcomes for environmental upgrades, to meet customers needs for the next decade. Northern Indiana continues to monitor and assess economic, regulatory and legislative activity, and will update its resource plan as appropriate. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment.

Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

The capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately $431.6 million, which is an increase of $130.1 million over 2011. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the Marcellus Shale area. Capital expenditures in the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment in 2010 increased by $14.6 million relative to 2009, primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects. Sales and Percentage of Physical Capacity Sold Columbia Transmission and Columbia Gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, available capacity and price. Columbia Gulf and Columbia Transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts, with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts. Firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points. Firm customers generally pay a capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used. Annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used. The high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment due to changes in near term supply and demand conditions. For 2011, approximately 91.7% of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 6.1% of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 91.2% and 5.6% respectively, for 2010. Interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported. The ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively, of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts. Hartsville Compressor Station In 2008, tornados damaged Columbia Gulfs Hartsville Compressor Station in Tennessee and immediately thereafter, construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored. Damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008. Late in 2009, construction of a permanent compression solution was completed. In early 2010, testing was completed and permanent, environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient, cleaner burning and quieter was placed into service. Replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010. Columbia Gulf incurred $0.4 million, $6.2 million and $12.2 million in reconstruction costs in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled $45.3 million in 2009. No proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of $22.9 million and an increase of $8.3 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was a $5.6 million increase in regulatory trackers, which are offset in expense, $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the period, and a $3.5 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of $23.1 million and a decrease of $9.1 million in mineral rights leasing revenues. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Operating Income Operating income was $360.0 million for 2011, a decrease of $16.6 million from the comparable period in 2010. Operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher operating revenues, as described above. Operating expenses increased $72.6 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of $50.8 million, driven largely by pension contributions, higher environmental costs of $12.4 million, and higher regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in net revenues. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.9 million in software costs and $4.1 million in separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million in outside service costs. Equity earnings decreased $0.4 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at Millennium. Operating income of $376.6 million in 2010 decreased $11.3 million from 2009, primarily due to increased operating expenses of $28.8 million and lower equity earnings of $1.0 million, partly offset by higher net operating revenues described above. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher maintenance and outside service costs of $22.0 million, including pipeline integrity management costs. Additionally, employee and administration expenses increased $18.5 million, primarily due to increased pension contributions, depreciation increased $9.2 million as a result of increased capital expenditures, regulatory trackers, which are offset in revenue, increased $5.6 million, and materials and supplies cost increased $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.9 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and lower environmental costs of $2.9 million. Equity earnings decreased $1.0 million primarily resulting from lower earnings from Columbia Transmissions investment in Millennium, driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to Millenniums August 2010 debt refinancing. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production.

The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Gas Transmission and Storage Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment. Restructuring Plan Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Throughput Columbia Transmission provides transportation and storage services for LDCs and other customers within its market area, which covers portions of northeastern, mid Atlantic, midwestern, and southern states and the District of Columbia. Billed throughput for Columbia Transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery. Billed throughput for Columbia Gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals. Crossroads Pipelines throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern Indiana and Ohio. Intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,635.7 MMDth for 2011, compared to 1,397.5 MMDth for the same period in 2010. The increase of 238.2 MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation from the Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the LDCs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal. Additionally, there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011. Throughput for the Gas Transmission and Storage Operations segment totaled 1,397.5 MMDth for 2010, compared to 1,391.4 MMDth in 2009. The increase of 6.1 MMDth is due to increased production from the Marcellus Shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system. A warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009. On the Columbia Gulf system, increased throughput out of the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Barnett shales have offset declining volumes from Gulf of Mexico area receipts. At the same time, the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from Columbia Gulf to Columbia Transmission comparable with 2009. Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $1,005.6 million for 2011, an increase of $56.4 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of $32.3 million as a result of new growth projects. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.8 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at Columbia Gulf. Net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of $10.6 million, higher mineral rights royalty revenues of $8.4 million, increased regulatory trackers of $5.9 million, which are offset in expense, and a one time settlement of $2.8 million. These increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of $8.3 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of $6.7 million and the impact of $5.4 million of fees received from a contract buy out during the second quarter of 2010. Operating revenues were $949.2 million for 2010, an increase of $18.5 million from 2009.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Market Conditions Northern Indianas mwh sales to steel related industries accounted for approximately 64.0% and 63.6% of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Northern Indianas industrial sales volumes and revenues improved in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the economic recovery of the steel industry from its 2008 2009 recession lows. The U.S. steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions. Predominant factors are global and domestic manufacturing demand and industry consolidation. Steel related mwh volumes and demands have stabilized considerably since the volatility of the 2008 2009 period and the steel producers in Northern Indianas service territory continue to see modest increases in production. Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities The table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009, 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012.

The increase in capital was primarily attributable to increased environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. Capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately $413.6 million in 2012, which is an increase of $145.9 million. This increase is mainly due to environmental tracker capital for FGD projects in the generation fleet. The Electric Operations capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 increased by $27.7 million compared to 2009. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily attributable to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet. Regulatory Matters Refer to Note 8, Regulatory Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on significant rate developments, MISO, and cost recovery and trackers for the Electric Operations segment. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Electric Operations segment. As of December 31, 2011, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20 D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Electric Operations segment. Restructuring Refer to Note 3, Impairments, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives. Sales Electric Operations sales were 17,487.7 gwh for the year 2011, an increase of 479.7 gwh compared to 2010. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Electric Operations sales were 17,008.0 gwh for the year 2010, an increase of 1,482.3 gwh compared to 2009. The increase occurred primarily from higher industrial volumes as a result of improvement in overall economic conditions. Additionally, warmer weather in 2010 resulted in an increase in sales. 61 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NISOURCE INC. Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $886.6 million for 2011, an increase of $7.6 million from the same period in 2010, primarily due to increased industrial usage and margins of $18.7 million resulting from improved economic conditions, $9.5 million in lower revenue credits compared to the prior year, and higher environmental trackers of $5.5 million, which are offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in residential and commercial margins of $12.2 million, and lower environmental cost recovery of $12.0 million due to a decrease in net plant eligible for a return and a decrease in the allowed rate of return. Net revenues were $879.0 million for 2010, an increase of $113.1 million from 2009. This increase was primarily the result of higher industrial usage and margins of $45.1 million due to improved economic conditions, warmer weather of approximately $35 million, and a $17.1 million increase in environmental trackers, which are partially offset in operating expenses. Additionally, there was an increase of $14.6 million in off system sales, including a reduction of $8.2 million in off system sales in 2009 resulting from a FAC settlement. At Northern Indiana, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a revenue decrease of $20.6 million and a revenue increase of $46.5 million, respectively. Operating Income Operating income for 2011 was $209.5 million, a decrease of $11.3 million from the same period in 2010 due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses increased $18.9 million due primarily to increased employee and administrative costs of $14.8 million and higher outside service costs of $8.4 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 million one time inventory adjustment recorded in the prior period. Operating income for 2010 was $220.8 million, an increase of $103.9 million from 2009. The increase in operating income was due to increased net revenues described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $9.2 million. The increase in operating expenses was the result of an increase of $7.8 million in other taxes, primarily property, a charge of $5.9 million for inventory disposal and other costs associated with the rate case, higher electric generation costs of $5.5 million, and an increase of $5.6 million in depreciation costs. These were partially offset by $10.0 million for a legal reserve which was recorded in 2009, $3.6 million for lower restructuring costs, and $3.2 million in lower uncollectible costs. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.
