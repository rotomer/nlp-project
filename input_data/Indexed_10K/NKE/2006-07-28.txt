Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview NIKE designs, develops and markets high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts, NIKE owned retail stores, independent distributors and licensees, in the United States and over 160 countries worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable portfolio of global footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories brands. Our strategy for building this portfolio is focused in four key areas: Deepening our relationship with consumers; Delivering superior, innovative products to the marketplace; Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, through operational discipline and excellence; and Accelerating growth through focused execution. By executing this strategy, we aim to deliver the following long term financial goals: High single digit revenue growth; Mid teens earnings per share growth; Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows; and Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. In fiscal 2006, we met most of these financial goals. Our revenues grew 9% to $15 billion, net income grew 15% to $1.4 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $5.28, an 18% increase versus fiscal 2005. These reported results included a $51.9 million charge related to an unfavorable arbitration ruling involving our Converse subsidiary (see Note 5 Accrued Liabilities in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Converse arbitration charge). Excluding this charge, our net income grew 17% and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $5.39, a 20% increase versus fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2006, our consolidated gross margin percentage decreased 50 basis points to 44.0% primarily due to lower in line net pricing margins (net revenue for current product offerings minus product costs) partially offset by improvements in year over year currency hedge rates. The decline in the gross margin percentage and the Converse arbitration charge were more than offset by 80 basis points of selling and administrative expense leverage (due entirely to slowing the growth of operating overhead spending), and higher interest income resulting in a higher pre tax income margin in fiscal 2006 than in fiscal 2005. In addition, we increased free cash flow from operations and 20 Table of Contents continued to return larger amounts of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases. Our return on invested capital declined slightly as compared to fiscal 2005. Although we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above in any particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, we continue to believe these are appropriate long term goals.

Results of Operations Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions, except per share data) Revenues $ 14,954.9 $ 13,739.7 9 % $ 12,253.1 12 % Cost of sales 8,367.9 7,624.3 10 % 7,001.4 9 % Gross margin 6,587.0 6,115.4 8 % 5,251.7 16 % Gross margin % 44.0 % 44.5 % 42.9 % Selling and administrative expense 4,477.8 4,221.7 6 % 3,702.0 14 % % of Revenues 29.9 % 30.7 % 30.2 % Income before income taxes 2,141.6 1,859.8 15 % 1,450.0 28 % Net income 1,392.0 1,211.6 15 % 945.6 28 % Diluted earnings per share 5.28 4.48 18 % 3.51 28 % Consolidated Operating Results Revenues Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) Revenues $ 14,954.9 $ 13,739.7 9 % $ 12,253.1 12 % Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In fiscal 2006, changes in currency exchange rates reduced the reported consolidated revenue growth by 1 percentage point. The U.S. Region contributed 4 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006. Excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, revenue growth in our international regions contributed 4 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006, as all of our international regions posted higher revenues. Sales in our Other businesses drove the remainder of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006. Revenues for our Other businesses are comprised substantially of results from Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter Brands Group, Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey and NIKE Golf. 21 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 In fiscal 2005, 3 percentage points of the revenue growth were attributed to changes in currency exchange rates, primarily the stronger euro. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency, revenue growth in our international regions contributed 4 percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth, as all of our international regions posted higher revenues. The U.S. Region contributed 3 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2005. Sales in our Other businesses drove the remainder of the improvement of consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2005. Converse was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The comparison of a full year of Converse results in fiscal 2005 versus a partial year in fiscal 2004 contributed 1 percentage point to the consolidated revenue growth. See the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 15 Acquisitions) for additional information related to the acquisition. Gross Margin 2006 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 Change 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 Change (In millions) Gross Margin $ 6,587.0 $ 6,115.4 8% $ 5,251.7 16% Gross Margin % 44.0 % 44.5 % (50 ) bps 42.9 % 160 bps Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 During fiscal 2006, our consolidated gross margin percentage declined 50 basis points versus the prior year. The primary factors contributing to the reduced gross margin percentage for fiscal 2006 were as follows: (1) Lower footwear in line net pricing margins in the U.S., Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific regions. The lower footwear in line net pricing margins were due to higher product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices; additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand in the U.S.; higher sales incentives in EMEA and Asia Pacific; strategies to improve consumer value in EMEA and Japan; and a shift in the mix of footwear models sold towards models with lower margins within EMEA and Japan. (2) A shift in the mix of revenues reported from our operating segments towards regions and subsidiaries with lower margins. The factors driving a reduced gross margin percentage were partially offset by: (1) Year over year currency hedge rate improvements, primarily for the euro. (2) Improved gross margin percentages in our Other businesses driven by improvements at Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 During fiscal 2005, our consolidated gross margin percentage improved 160 basis points versus the prior year. The primary factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage for fiscal 2005 were as follows: (1) Higher gross margins in our international regions, driven primarily by our EMEA Region. This improvement was driven by changes in currency hedge rates, primarily the euro, partially offset by lower in line net pricing margins and a higher percentage of less profitable closeout sales (non current product offerings) in our EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. The lower in line net pricing margins were due to strategies to improve consumer value. The increased levels of closeout sales and lower closeout pricing were the result of the liquidation of higher footwear and apparel closeout inventories in our EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. 22 Table of Contents (2) Higher gross margins in the U.S. Region primarily due to fewer, more profitable closeouts in footwear partially offset by increased sales discounts and higher costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand. (3) Improved gross margin percentages in our Other businesses driven by the addition of Converse (acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2004) and Exeter Brands Group (formed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005). Both Exeter Brands Group and the international portion of Converses business operate on a licensing model, which carries higher gross margins and lower operating expenses than the remainder of our Other businesses. Selling and Administrative Expense Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 Change (In millions) Demand creation expense* $ 1,740.2 $ 1,600.7 9% $ 1,377.9 16% Operating overhead expense 2,737.6 2,621.0 4% 2,324.1 13% Selling and administrative expense 4,477.8 4,221.7 6% 3,702.0 14% % of Revenues 29.9 % 30.7 % (80) bps 30.2 % 50 bps * Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In fiscal 2006, selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues by 80 basis points for the year driven by operating overhead leverage. Changes in currency exchange rates reduced selling and administrative expense growth by 1 percentage point. In fiscal 2006, changes in currency exchange rates reduced the rate of growth in demand creation by 1 percentage point. The growth in demand creation spending in fiscal 2006 was in line with our revenue growth. The year over year increase in demand creation spending was primarily due to increased spending on sports marketing endorsement contracts and events, increased spending on retail marketing programs (in store marketing at our retail partners), and advertising primarily around the global World Cup and Winter Olympics campaigns and for the global Air Max 360 footwear launch. While consolidated revenues grew 9% in fiscal 2006, operating overhead for fiscal 2006 increased only 4% over fiscal 2005 as a result of expense management strategies to slow the growth of operating overhead spending. Changes in currency exchange rates reduced the rate of growth in operating overhead by 1 percentage point. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the increase in operating overhead for fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 was mainly attributable to higher personnel costs (both increased headcount and higher compensation) to support the growth of our business, including our Other businesses and new NIKE owned retail stores. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 In fiscal 2005, 3 percentage points of the selling and administrative expense increase were due to changes in currency exchange rates. The impact of a full fiscal year for Converse and the formation of Exeter Brands Group added 1 percentage point of growth. In fiscal 2005, 3 percentage points of the increase in demand creation were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates, the increase in demand creation spending for the fiscal year was attributable to higher spending on sports marketing endorsement contracts and 23 Table of Contents events primarily in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, higher advertising spending primarily in the EMEA Region, and increased spending on retail marketing programs in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. The addition of Converse and formation of Exeter Brands Group also contributed to the demand creation increase for the year. Changes in currency exchange rates contributed 3 percentage points of the increase to operating overhead expense in fiscal 2005. Excluding the effects of foreign currency, operating overhead increases for fiscal 2005 were mainly attributable to higher personnel costs (both increased headcount and higher compensation), investments in emerging markets (such as China, India and our Central Europe, Middle East and Africa unit) and our Other businesses, increased costs due to sales and leadership events and higher spending associated with new NIKE owned retail stores. Other Expense, net Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) Other Expense, net $ 4.4 $ 29.1 (85 )% $ 74.7 (61 )% Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 The significant reduction in Other expense, net for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily driven by foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal 2006 compared to foreign currency hedge losses in the prior year, partially offset by the Converse arbitration charge. The fiscal 2006 hedge gains primarily reflected that the euro had weakened since we entered into these hedge contracts and are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment presentation of pre tax income in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 17 Operating Segments and Related Information). In fiscal 2006, these net foreign currency hedge gains were partially offset by unfavorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most significantly in the EMEA Region. We estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge gains in other expense, net, and the unfavorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits resulted in an increase to consolidated income before income taxes of approximately $55 million for fiscal 2006 compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 The most significant component of other expense, net, of $29.1 million for fiscal 2005 was foreign currency hedge losses. The hedge losses reflected that the euro had strengthened since we entered into these hedge contracts. In fiscal 2004, foreign currency hedge losses were also the most significant component of other expense, net, of $74.7 million. The year over year improvement in other expense, net, for fiscal 2005 was mainly due to lower foreign currency hedge losses and lower net losses on asset disposals compared to those recorded in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, these net foreign currency losses in other expense, net, were more than offset by favorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most significantly in the EMEA Region. We estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge losses in other expense, net, and the favorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits resulted in an increase to consolidated income before income taxes of approximately $95 million for fiscal 2005 compared to the prior year. 24 Table of Contents Income Taxes Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 Change Effective Tax Rate 35.0 % 34.9 % 10 bps 34.8 % 10 bps Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was consistent with the rate reported for fiscal 2005. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, our CEO and Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan as required by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) to repatriate $500 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the U.S. by providing an 85% dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. A $500 million repatriation was made during the quarter ending May 31, 2006 comprised of both foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes has previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested. Accordingly, the provisions made did not have a material impact on the Companys income tax expense or effective tax rate for the year. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was slightly higher than the fiscal 2004 rate primarily due to decreases in tax credits partially offset by lower taxes on foreign earnings in fiscal 2005. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we decided to repatriate $500 million of foreign earnings during fiscal 2006 under the Act. As discussed above, because we elected to repatriate a combination of foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes had previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested, the provisions made did not have a material impact on our income tax expense or our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005. Futures Orders Worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2006 were 5.0% higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2005. This futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. The net effect from changes in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on this reported growth versus the same period last year. Slightly higher average selling prices for both footwear and apparel contributed approximately 1 percentage point of the growth in overall futures and advance orders. The remaining 4 percentage points of the increase were due to volume increases for both footwear and apparel. The reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at once orders. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders, and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at once and closeout sales of NIKE footwear and apparel, wholesale sales of equipment, U.S. licensed team apparel, Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter Brands Group, Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey, NIKE Golf and retail sales across all brands. 25 Table of Contents Operating Segments The breakdown of revenues follows: Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) U.S. Region Footwear $ 3,832.2 $ 3,358.2 14 % $ 3,070.4 9 % Apparel 1,591.6 1,457.7 9 % 1,433.5 2 % Equipment 298.7 313.4 (5 )% 277.9 13 % Total U.S 5,722.5 5,129.3 12 % 4,781.8 7 % EMEA Region Footwear 2,454.3 2,500.0 (2 )% 2,232.2 12 % Apparel 1,559.0 1,497.1 4 % 1,333.8 12 % Equipment 313.3 284.5 10 % 261.7 9 % Total EMEA 4,326.6 4,281.6 1 % 3,827.7 12 % Asia Pacific Region Footwear 1,044.1 962.9 8 % 855.3 13 % Apparel 815.6 755.5 8 % 612.3 23 % Equipment 194.1 178.9 8 % 143.2 25 % Total Asia Pacific 2,053.8 1,897.3 8 % 1,610.8 18 % Americas Region Footwear 635.3 478.6 33 % 408.2 17 % Apparel 201.8 169.1 19 % 159.5 6 % Equipment 67.8 48.1 41 % 36.8 31 % Total Americas 904.9 695.8 30 % 604.5 15 % 13,007.8 12,004.0 8 % 10,824.8 11 % Other 1,947.1 1,735.7 12 % 1,428.3 22 % Total Revenues $ 14,954.9 $ 13,739.7 9 % $ 12,253.1 12 % The breakdown of income before income taxes (pre tax income) follows: Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) U.S. Region $ 1,244.5 $ 1,127.9 10 % $ 1,007.3 12 % EMEA Region 960.7 917.5 5 % 744.0 23 % Asia Pacific Region 412.5 399.8 3 % 352.3 13 % Americas Region 172.6 116.5 48 % 97.4 20 % Other 151.6 151.4 % 75.3 101 % Corporate (800.3 ) (853.3 ) 6 % (826.3 ) (3 )% Total Pre tax Income $ 2,141.6 $ 1,859.8 15 % $ 1,450.0 28 % ** Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal year 2006 presentation.

We have reported pre tax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. As discussed in Note 17 Operating Segments and Related Information in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in pre tax income of our operating segments. U.S. Region Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 3,832.2 $ 3,358.2 14 % $ 3,070.4 9 % Apparel 1,591.6 1,457.7 9 % 1,433.5 2 % Equipment 298.7 313.4 (5 )% 277.9 13 % Total Revenues $ 5,722.5 $ 5,129.3 12 % $ 4,781.8 7 % Pre tax Income $ 1,244.5 $ 1,127.9 10 % $ 1,007.3 12 % Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 The increase in footwear revenues was due to a strong increase in unit sales, accounting for 12 percentage points of the growth, and an increase in the average selling price per pair, accounting for 2 percentage points of the growth. The strong unit increase was driven by increased consumer demand across a majority of the footwear product categories, most significantly high demand for our Jordan branded and sport culture products. The higher average selling price per pair was primarily due to increased consumer demand for products with a suggested retail price over $100, driven by Jordan branded products as well as NIKE branded sport performance and sport culture products. The increase in U.S. apparel sales for fiscal 2006 was driven by increased unit sales in NIKE and Jordan branded apparel, partially offset by sales declines in licensed apparel, primarily due to the expiration of our license agreement with the NBA in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The increases in NIKE branded apparel were primarily due to increased sales of sport performance products. For the U.S. Region, the increase in pre tax income for fiscal 2006 as compared to 2005 was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, more than offsetting a lower gross margin percentage. The lower gross margin percentage was primarily the result of lower in line net pricing margins for footwear due to higher product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices, and additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2005, but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage. The increase in selling and administrative costs was due to increases in both demand creation and operating overhead. The increase in demand creation was primarily driven by increased spending on sports marketing endorsements and events and increased advertising, primarily due to the global campaigns discussed above. The increase in operating overhead spending was driven by increased spending for new NIKE owned retail stores, higher personnel costs and higher travel and meeting expenses. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 The increase in footwear revenue was due to a 5 percentage point increase in unit sales and a 4 percentage point increase in the average price per pair. The increases in unit sales and the average price per pair were due to increased consumer demand for sport performance products, especially those with a suggested retail price over $100. 27 Table of Contents The increase in apparel sales for fiscal 2005 was driven by volume increases in branded apparel, partially offset by a decline in revenue from sales of licensed apparel. The decline in revenue from licensed apparel was due to the expiration of our license agreement with the NBA, in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, and a shift in consumer preference towards branded apparel. For fiscal 2005, higher revenues, an improved gross margin percentage, and slightly lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues drove the U.S. Region pre tax income increase. The improved gross margin percentage was primarily the result of fewer, more profitable closeout sales partially offset by increased sales discounts (the result of increased sales to high volume accounts) and higher costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2004, but represented a slightly smaller percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage. The increase in selling and administrative costs was due to increases in both demand creation and operating overhead. The increase in demand creation was primarily driven by increased spending on sports marketing endorsements and events and increased retail marketing spending. The increase in operating overhead spending was driven by increased spending on personnel costs and new NIKE owned retail stores and higher costs related to sales and leadership events. EMEA Region Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 2,454.3 $ 2,500.0 (2 )% $ 2,232.2 12 % Apparel 1,559.0 1,497.1 4 % 1,333.8 12 % Equipment 313.3 284.5 10 % 261.7 9 % Total Revenues $ 4,326.6 $ 4,281.6 1 % $ 3,827.7 12 % Pre tax Income $ 960.7 $ 917.5 5 % $ 744.0 23 % Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 For the EMEA Region, changes in currency exchange rates reduced revenue growth by 4 percentage points in fiscal 2006. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, all three product business units grew. Excluding currency changes, the increase in footwear revenues reflected increased unit sales partially offset by declines in the average selling price per pair. The increased unit sales were driven by increased demand for sport culture products. The declines in the average selling price per pair were due in part to changes in the mix of in line products sold towards products with a lower average selling price and higher sales incentives as a result of a difficult retail environment in Western Europe. The increase in EMEA apparel revenue was driven by increased unit sales and average selling prices of NIKE branded apparel, primarily increased unit sales of sport performance products, including soccer products driven by the World Cup, and increased average selling prices across most apparel categories. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, sales increases in the emerging markets of our Central Europe, Middle East and Africa unit led the revenue growth, while sales increases in Western and Northern Europe also contributed to the EMEA sales growth for fiscal 2006. The increase in pre tax income for the EMEA Region for fiscal 2006 was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues more than offsetting a lower gross margin percentage and unfavorable foreign currency translation versus fiscal 2005. The lower gross margin percentage was primarily the result of lower in line net pricing margins in footwear and apparel, partially offset by improved year over year hedge rates. The lower in line net pricing margins for footwear were due to higher product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices, higher sales incentives, strategies to improve consumer value, and a shift in the mix of products sold towards products with lower margins. The reduced in line net pricing margins for 28 Table of Contents apparel were primarily due to higher product costs and higher sales incentives. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 were higher than in fiscal 2005 but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage. Excluding currency changes, the increase in selling and administrative costs was driven by higher demand creation expenses partially offset by slightly lower operating overhead expenses. The higher demand creation expenses were primarily due to spending related to the World Cup campaign and increased spending on retail marketing programs. The slightly lower operating overhead expenses were due to lower spending on travel and meeting expenses, lower bad debt expense and slightly lower personnel costs related to our wholesale business, partially offset by increased spending to support the growth of NIKE owned retail stores. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 For EMEA, changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for 7 percentage points of the reported revenue growth in fiscal 2005. Excluding the effects of foreign currency, all three product business units grew. Excluding currency changes, the increase over the prior year was primarily driven by increased unit sales of footwear, apparel and equipment partially offset by declines in the average prices in each of the product business units. For fiscal 2005, excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, sales increases in the emerging markets in our Central Europe, Middle East and Africa unit, along with sales increases in the UK and Italy, drove the growth. These increases were partially offset by lower sales in France, Germany and Northern Europe. The increase in pre tax income in the EMEA region in fiscal 2005 was driven by higher revenues and gross margin improvements, more than offsetting increased selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues. The improved gross margins were primarily the result of improved year over year hedge rates partially offset by reduced in line net pricing margins (due to strategies to improve consumer value) and higher, less profitable closeout sales (the result of the liquidation of higher footwear and apparel closeout inventories). The increase in selling and administrative expenses was driven by increases in both demand creation and operating overhead. The increase in demand creation was primarily driven by increased advertising and higher spending on sports marketing endorsements and events. The increase in operating overhead spending was driven by increased spending on personnel costs to support the growth of our wholesale business and new NIKE owned retail stores and higher costs related to sales and leadership events. Asia Pacific Region Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 1,044.1 $ 962.9 8 % $ 855.3 13 % Apparel 815.6 755.5 8 % 612.3 23 % Equipment 194.1 178.9 8 % 143.2 25 % Total Revenues $ 2,053.8 $ 1,897.3 8 % $ 1,610.8 18 % Pre tax Income $ 412.5 $ 399.8 3 % $ 352.3 13 % Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates reduced revenue growth by 1 percentage point for fiscal 2006. Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for each Asia Pacific product business unit were higher than fiscal 2005. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenues reflected increased unit sales (driven by increased unit sales across most countries and categories), partially offset by lower average selling prices (due to strategies to improve consumer value in Japan). The increase in apparel revenues was driven by increases across sport performance and sport culture categories. Increased revenue in 29 Table of Contents China (driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand) was the primary growth driver for fiscal 2006, partially offset by lower sales in Japan driven by lower average selling prices due to investments in consumer value and a challenging retail marketplace. The increase in fiscal 2006 pre tax income for the Asia Pacific Region was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage. The lower gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to lower in line net pricing margins due to higher footwear product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices; strategies to improve consumer value for footwear in Japan; and a shift in the mix of footwear and apparel products sold in Japan toward products with lower margins. Selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 were higher than fiscal 2005, but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage. The increased selling and administrative expenses were due to increases in demand creation, primarily driven by spending related to the World Cup campaign, and slightly higher operating overhead, primarily due to higher personnel costs to support growth in China. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 In the Asia Pacific Region, 4 percentage points of reported revenue growth for fiscal 2005 were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, sales in each Asia Pacific product business unit grew versus fiscal 2004 with the growth primarily due to unit volume; average price per unit increased slightly. Excluding currency changes, significant revenue increases in China (driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand) and increases in every other country in the region except Australia and New Zealand were the key growth drivers for fiscal 2005. The increase in pre tax income for the Asia Pacific Region in fiscal 2005 was driven by higher revenues, partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage and increased selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues. The reduced gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to less profitable closeout sales and lower in line net pricing margins due to strategies to improve the consumer value in Japan, partially offset by better year over year currency hedge rates. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was due to increases in both demand creation (driven by higher spending on sports marketing endorsements and events and increased spending on retail marketing programs) and operating overhead (driven by increased spending on personnel costs to support the growth of our business and higher costs related to sales and leadership events). Americas Region Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 635.3 $ 478.6 33 % $ 408.2 17 % Apparel 201.8 169.1 19 % 159.5 6 % Equipment 67.8 48.1 41 % 36.8 31 % Total Revenues $ 904.9 $ 695.8 30 % $ 604.5 15 % Pre tax Income $ 172.6 $ 116.5 48 % $ 97.4 20 % Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In the Americas Region, 11 percentage points of the revenue growth for fiscal 2006 were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Even excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, sales in each Americas product business unit grew in fiscal 2006. The revenue growth was driven by increased sales in every country in the region, with significant sales increases in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. 30 Table of Contents The increase in fiscal 2006 pre tax income for the Americas Region was attributable to higher revenues, an improved gross margin percentage, lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues and favorable currency translation. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2005, but represented a lower percentage of revenues for fiscal 2006. The increased selling and administrative expenses were due to increases in both demand creation (due to increased sports marketing endorsement contracts, and increased advertising spending and retail marketing programs primarily related to the World Cup campaign) and operating overhead (driven by increased personnel costs as a result of continued expansion of the business across the region). Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 In the Americas Region, 1 percentage point of the revenue growth for fiscal 2005 was due to changes in currency exchange rates. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency, sales in each Americas product business unit grew in fiscal 2005. The revenue growth was driven primarily by higher sales in Central and South America, partially offset by lower sales in Canada. The increase in fiscal 2005 pre tax income for the Americas Region was attributable to higher revenues and an improved gross margin percentage, partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues. The increased selling and administrative expenses were due to increases in both demand creation (due to increased spending on sports marketing endorsement contract and events, advertising and retail marketing programs) and operating overhead (driven by increased personnel costs). Other Businesses Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change Fiscal 2004 FY05 vs. FY04 % Change (In millions) Revenues $ 1,947.1 $ 1,735.7 12 % $ 1,428.3 22 % Pre tax Income $ 151.6 $ 151.4 % $ 75.3 101 % Converse arbitration charge 51.9 Pre tax Income, excluding the Converse arbitration charge $ 203.5 $ 151.4 34 % $ 75.3 101 % We are providing pre tax income excluding the Converse arbitration charge to enhance the visibility of the underlying earnings trend excluding this identifiable expense. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenue increases for our Other businesses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 were driven primarily by growth at Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf. Pre tax income from the Other businesses for fiscal 2006 was consistent with fiscal 2005 and included a $51.9 million charge related to the unfavorable arbitration ruling involving a licensing agreement contract dispute with our Converse subsidiary and a former South American licensee. This charge reduced reported pre tax income for the Other businesses by 34 percentage points. Excluding the Converse arbitration charge, the pre tax income improvement was driven by improved profitability at Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf, partially offset by a loss at NIKE Bauer Hockey. The loss at NIKE Bauer Hockey was largely the result of costs incurred in connection with a re branding initiative. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 For fiscal 2005, the addition of Converse, acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, and the formation of Exeter Brands Group, formed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 to develop the Companys business in retail 31 Table of Contents channels serving value conscious consumers and to operate the business obtained in the acquisition of Official Starter Properties LLC and Official Starter LLC (collectively Official Starter), together drove 12 percentage points of the Other business revenue increase of 22% over fiscal 2004. The remainder of the increase was driven by revenue growth at Cole Haan, Hurley and NIKE Golf. The year over year improvement in fiscal 2005 pre tax income from the Other businesses was driven by the addition of Converse, improved results from Cole Haan and NIKE Bauer Hockey and the formation of the Exeter Brands Group. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal 2006 Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2006, compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2005. Our primary source of operating cash flow was net income of $1.4 billion. For fiscal 2006, our net investment in working capital increased $43.2 million as compared to an increase of $13.0 million in fiscal 2005. This increased investment in working capital was largely attributable to a larger increase in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The increase in inventories reflects higher in transit inventories (due primarily to growth in reported futures and other orders, and earlier product ordering compared to last year) and higher inventories to support the expansion of NIKE owned retail stores. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased in fiscal 2006 compared to a decrease in the prior year, primarily due to the timing of payments, including earlier payments of income taxes in certain foreign locations. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is primarily due to the timing of payments and inventory receipts compared to the prior year. Cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2006 was $1.3 billion, compared to $360.4 million invested during fiscal 2005. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to a higher net increase in short term investments (purchases net of maturities), which increased from $35.3 million in fiscal 2005 to $909.9 million in fiscal 2006, and increased net additions to property, plant and equipment. The additions to property, plant and equipment primarily reflect capital expenditures on computer equipment and software (to support both normal business operations and our supply chain systems upgrade), and continued investment in NIKE owned retail stores. In fiscal 2006, we purchased approximately 9.5 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for $781.2 million. The share repurchases were part of a four year, $1.5 billion share repurchase program that was approved by the Board of Directors in June 2004. Since the inception of this program, we have repurchased 16.4 million shares, at a total cost of $1.3 billion. In June 2006, the Board of Directors approved a new four year, $3.0 billion share repurchase program, to commence upon completion of the $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We expect to fund share repurchases from operating cash flow, excess cash, and or debt. The timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the programs will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal 2006 were $1.18, compared to $0.95 in fiscal 2005. We have paid a dividend every quarter since February 1984. Our current dividend policy is to provide an annual dividend equal to 20% to 30% of the trailing twelve months earnings per share, paid out on a quarterly basis. We review our dividend policy from time to time, and based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements, we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items that fall under the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and 32 Table of Contents Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our long term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2006 are as follows: Cash Payments Due During the Year Ended May 31, Description of Commitment 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 229.0 $ 190.6 $ 158.8 $ 129.9 $ 116.9 $ 599.3 $ 1,424.5 Long term Debt 255.9 31.0 6.0 30.9 6.0 341.8 671.6 Endorsement Contracts(1) 476.5 349.6 241.2 160.8 108.0 306.0 1,642.1 Product Purchase Obligations(2) 1,850.4 1.0 1,851.4 Other(3) 196.3 53.0 39.5 12.6 10.6 1.3 313.3 Total $ 3,008.1 $ 625.2 $ 445.5 $ 334.2 $ 241.5 $ 1,248.4 $ 5,902.9 (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish the endorsers with NIKE products for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. (2) We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2006. (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2006. Excluded from the table above is a commitment to an outsourcing contractor that provides us with information technology operations management services through fiscal 2008. The amount of the payments in future years depends on our level of monthly use of the different elements of the contractors services. If we were to terminate the entire contract as of May 31, 2006, we would be required to provide the contractor with four months notice and pay a termination fee of $18.7 million. Our monthly payments to the contractor currently approximate $6 million. 33 Table of Contents We also have the following outstanding short term debt obligations as of May 31, 2006. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 6 Short term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as of May 31, 2006 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed upon dates, generally ninety days from issuance or on demand $ 43.4 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 69.7 As of May 31, 2006, letters of credit of $347.6 million were outstanding, generally for the purchase of inventory. Most letters of credit expire within one year. Capital Resources In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which $1 billion in debt securities may be issued. In May 2002, we commenced a medium term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to $500 million in medium term notes, as our capital needs dictate. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements and since commencement of the medium term note program we have issued $240.0 million in medium term notes. During fiscal 2006, there were no medium term notes issued under the program. We may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2007 depending on general corporate needs. As of May 31, 2006, we had a multi year $750 million revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks, and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the facility. The maturity date is November 20, 2008 and the facility can be extended for one additional year on the anniversary date. Based on our current long term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A2 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.18%. The facility fee is 0.07% of the total commitment. If our long term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, and set a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2006, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which there was no amount outstanding at May 31, 2006 or May 31, 2005. We currently have short term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively. We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 34 Table of Contents (FAS 151). FAS 151 clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are required to be recognized as current period charges. The provisions of FAS 151 are effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2006. We have evaluated the provisions of FAS 151 and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. On December 16, 2004, the FASB finalized SFAS No. 123R Share Based Payment, (FAS 123R) which, after the SEC amended the compliance dates on April 15, 2005, is effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2006. The new standard will require us to record compensation expense for stock options using a fair value method. On March 29, 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107), which provides the Staffs views regarding interactions between FAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies. We plan to adopt the new requirements under FAS 123R and SAB 107 beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2007 using the modified prospective transition method and the Black Scholes fair value model. As a result of the adoption of FAS 123R, we will recognize additional compensation expense of approximately $0.36 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. The amount of expense that will be recognized is largely dependent on several variables, including the level of share based payments that will be granted during the fiscal year in addition to the assumptions used in the valuation model. Accordingly, the actual effect per diluted share could differ from this estimate. The effect on our results of operations of expensing stock options for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 using the Black Scholes model is presented in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies). Under certain conditions, stock options granted by the Company are eligible for accelerated vesting upon the retirement of the employee. The FASB clarified in FAS 123R that the fair value of such stock options should be expensed based on the applicable accelerated vesting schedule, rather than ratably over the vesting period stated in the grant. Our pro forma disclosure currently reflects the expense of such options ratably over the stated vesting period, expensing all unvested shares upon actual retirement. The SEC clarified that companies should continue to follow the vesting method they have been using until adoption of FAS 123R, then apply the accelerated vesting schedule to all subsequent grants to those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement. Had we been accounting for such stock options using the accelerated vesting schedule for those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement, we would have recognized additional stock based compensation expense in our pro forma disclosure of the effect of expensing stock options presented in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies) of $0.01 per diluted share in fiscal 2006 and $0.05 per diluted share in fiscal 2005 and 2004. We usually grant the majority of stock options in a single grant in the first three months of each fiscal year. As a result, accelerated vesting will normally result in higher expense in the first three months and lower expense in the last nine months of each fiscal year, as compared to the pro forma expense we disclosed under our current policy of expensing such options ratably over the stated vesting period. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FIN 48. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 35 Table of Contents We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Reserve for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. In the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our 36 Table of Contents inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and is depreciated over its estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property, plant and equipment may be impaired, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value. Any impairment charges are recorded as other expense, net. We estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance. Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142), goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in 37 Table of Contents the fourth fiscal quarter, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. As required by FAS 142, in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value, we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value. Our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors, including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units. Our estimates may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological change, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods. Any impairment charge related to goodwill would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and any impairment charge related to other indefinite lived intangible assets would be classified as other expense, net. Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. In these cases, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value. Any impairment charges would be classified as other expense, net. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions, as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance. When specific criteria required by SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted (FAS 133) have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions changes significantly, we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other expense, net during the quarter in which such changes occur. Once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carryforwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. 38 Table of Contents We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding significant or infrequently occurring items, to determine the year to date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. We disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Therefore, actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other expense, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party and intercompany transactions. When we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months, although at May 31, 2006 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 18 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our European and Japanese subsidiaries. We use forward contracts to hedge 39 Table of Contents non functional currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros, Japanese yen, Korean won, Canadian dollars and Mexican pesos. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of medium and long term fixed rate debt, commercial paper, and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value at Risk (VaR). Our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the SEC, are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only, and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $17.5 million and $25.7 million at May 31, 2006 and May 31, 2005, respectively. The decrease in VaR as of May 31, 2006 occurred due to a lower notional value of outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments as of May 31, 2006 compared to May 31, 2005. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $34.9 million and $37.2 million for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. 40 Table of Contents Details of other market sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the VaR calculation above are provided in the table below, except the interest rate swaps which are described below. These instruments include intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

Accordingly, the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries. There were no significant changes in debt market risks during fiscal 2006. We did not issue any long term fixed rate corporate bonds during fiscal 2006 or 2005; however, in previous years we issued a total of $490 million in long term fixed rate corporate bonds that mature between August 2006 and October 2015. Fixed interest rates on these bonds range from 4.7% to 5.66%. For each of the bonds issued, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the three month or six month LIBOR plus a spread. As a result of the interest rate swap agreements the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was 6.07% at May 31, 2006 and 4.17% at May 31, 2005. For $440 million of the issued bonds, the associated swaps have the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond. These interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges, so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt. The remaining $50 million bond matures in October 2013 whereas the associated interest rate swap expires in October 2006. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded to net income each period. The recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges was a net $5.6 million loss at May 31, 2006 and a $9.0 million gain at May 31, 2005. The change in fair value of the $50 million interest rate swap expiring October 2006 was not material for the years ended May 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. In fiscal 2003 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a Japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our Japanese subsidiaries. The Japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on 3 month LIBOR plus a spread. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at 0.8% and receives variable interest payments based on 3 month LIBOR plus a spread based on a notional amount of 8 billion Japanese yen. This interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge, accordingly changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period. The change in fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended May 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.
