Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview NIKE designs, develops and markets high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts, NIKE owned retail, including stores and e commerce, and independent distributors and licensees in the United States and worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories. Through this diverse portfolio of brands, our strategy is to create long term revenue growth by connecting with consumers across geographies. We strive to convert revenue growth to value in three key areas: Creating the marketplace: Delivering premium experiences to our consumers Delivering superior, innovative products to the marketplace Operational and organizational excellence: Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, through operational discipline and excellence Reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing designed to eliminate waste Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin Improving working capital efficiency Deploying capital effectively: Utilizing capital capacity to create value for our shareholders By executing this strategy, we aim to deliver the following long term financial goals: High single digit revenue growth; Mid teens earnings per share growth; 22 Table of Contents Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows; and Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. In fiscal 2007, we met the majority of these financial goals. Our revenues grew 9% to $16.3 billion, net income grew 7% to $1.5 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $2.93, an 11% increase versus fiscal 2006. These reported results included a $141.9 million pre tax charge, related to stock based compensation expense recognized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R Share Based Payment (FAS 123R), which we adopted during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 (see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 10 Common Stock in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the adoption of FAS 123R), and the effects of the Converse arbitration ruling in fiscal 2006 and subsequent settlement in fiscal 2007. Excluding these items, our net income grew 11% and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $3.10, a 15% increase versus fiscal 2006 (see Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding the Converse Arbitration and Stock Based Compensation Expense below). Fiscal 2007 results were positively affected by a reduction in our effective tax rate of 2.8 percentage points as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily as a result of the European tax agreement the Company finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. For the year, the increase in net income was below our rate of revenue growth due to higher selling and administrative expenses versus the same period in the prior year. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was attributable to the adoption of FAS 123R and higher investments in growth drivers such as demand creation and operating overhead. Our earnings per share for the year grew at a higher rate than net income given lower outstanding shares due to repurchases made under our share repurchase program. In addition, we increased cash flow from operations and continued to return larger amounts of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases. Our return on invested capital declined slightly as compared to fiscal 2006 as a result of the adoption of FAS 123R. Although we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above in any particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, we continue to believe these are appropriate long term goals.

Consolidated Operating Results Revenues Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) Revenues $ 16,325.9 $ 14,954.9 9 % $ 13,739.7 9 % Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 During fiscal 2007, changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed 2 percentage points of consolidated revenue growth. Strong demand for NIKE brand products continued to drive revenue growth, as all four of our geographic regions and, on a consolidated basis, all three of our product business units delivered revenue growth. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, both the U.S. Region and our international regions each contributed more than 2.5 percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2007. Our Other businesses, comprised of results from Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter Brands Group, Hurley International, NIKE Bauer Hockey, and NIKE Golf contributed the remaining 2 percentage points of the consolidated constant currency revenue growth, as each business within the group posted higher revenues. By product group, our worldwide NIKE brand footwear revenue grew 7% and contributed nearly $550 million of incremental revenue for fiscal 2007. Our worldwide NIKE brand equipment and apparel businesses reported revenue growth of 12% and 10% for the year, respectively, and combined added more than $500 million of incremental revenue. 24 Table of Contents Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In fiscal 2006, changes in currency exchange rates reduced reported consolidated revenue growth by 1 percentage point. The U.S. Region contributed 4 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006. Excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, revenue growth in our international regions contributed 4 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006, as all of our international regions posted higher revenues. Sales in our Other businesses drove the remainder of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006. Gross Margin Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 Change (In millions) Gross Margin $ 7,160.5 $ 6,587.0 9% $ 6,115.4 8% Gross Margin % 43.9 % 44.0 % (10) bps 44.5 % (50) bps Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 During fiscal 2007, the primary factors contributing to the 10 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage versus the prior year were as follows: (1) Lower footwear net pricing margins in the U.S. and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Regions, primarily due to sales discounts, combined with a higher closeout mix; partially offset by (2) Favorable hedge results relative to the prior year, primarily in the Asia Pacific Region; (3) Better inventory management, most notably in our Asia Pacific Region; and (4) Improved gross margins in our Other businesses, driven primarily by the growth in Converses international licensing business, partially offset by the expected effects of the transition in Exeters business from a licensing model to a wholesale model. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 During fiscal 2006, our consolidated gross margin percentage declined 50 basis points versus the prior year. The primary factors contributing to the reduced gross margin percentage for fiscal 2006 were as follows: (1) Lower footwear in line net pricing margins in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific Regions. The lower footwear in line net pricing margins were due to higher product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices; additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand in the U.S.; higher sales incentives in EMEA and Asia Pacific; strategies to improve consumer value in EMEA and Japan; and a shift in the mix of footwear models sold towards models with lower margins within EMEA and Japan. (2) A shift in the mix of revenues reported from our operating segments towards regions and subsidiaries with lower margins. The factors driving a reduced gross margin percentage were partially offset by: (1) Year over year currency hedge rate improvements, primarily for the euro. (2) Improved gross margin percentages in our Other businesses driven by improvements at Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf. 25 Table of Contents Selling and Administrative Expense Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 Change (In millions) Operating overhead expense, excluding stock based compensation expense $ 2,974.4 $ 2,737.6 9% $ 2,621.0 4% Stock based compensation expense(1) 141.9 Operating overhead expense, as reported 3,116.3 2,737.6 14% 2,621.0 4% Demand creation expense(2) 1,912.4 1,740.2 10% 1,600.7 9% Selling and administrative expense 5,028.7 4,477.8 12% 4,221.7 6% % of Revenues 30.8 % 29.9 % 90 bps 30.7 % (80) bps * This schedule is intended to satisfy the quantitative reconciliation for non GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G of the SEC. In addition, this schedule is provided to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding this identifiable expense by presenting our results for fiscal 2007 using the same accounting policy for stock based compensation expense applied during the comparable prior year periods. (1) This charge relates to stock based compensation associated with stock options and ESPP shares issued to employees and expensed in accordance with FAS 123R. We adopted FAS 123R during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 using the modified prospective transition method. While this expense was not reflected in our results of operations for fiscal 2006 and 2005, it will continue to be reflected in future accounting periods. (2) Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In fiscal 2007, selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues by 90 basis points; however, excluding the $141.9 million pre tax charge relating to the change in accounting for stock based compensation, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was consistent with the prior year. On a constant currency basis, demand creation expense increased 7% versus the prior year. The year over year increase was primarily attributable to investments in the NIKE Air&reg;, NIKE+, NIKE Pro, and Force Basketball campaigns. For fiscal year 2007, constant currency growth in demand creation expense was consistent with our constant currency revenue growth. Excluding stock based compensation expense and the effects of changes in exchange rates, operating overhead increased 7%, which was in line with our constant currency revenue growth. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in growth drivers such as NIKE owned retail and non NIKE brands, as well as normal wage inflation. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In fiscal 2006, selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues by 80 basis points for the year driven by operating overhead leverage. Changes in currency exchange rates reduced selling and administrative expense growth by 1 percentage point. In fiscal 2006, changes in currency exchange rates reduced the rate of growth in demand creation by 1 percentage point. The growth in demand creation spending in fiscal 2006 was in line with our revenue growth. The year over year increase in demand creation spending was primarily due to increased spending on sports 26 Table of Contents marketing endorsement contracts and events, increased spending on retail marketing programs (in store marketing at our retail partners), and advertising primarily around the global World Cup and Winter Olympics campaigns and for the global Air Max 360 footwear launch. While consolidated revenues grew 9% in fiscal 2006, operating overhead for fiscal 2006 increased only 4% over fiscal 2005 as a result of expense management strategies to slow the growth of operating overhead spending. Changes in currency exchange rates reduced the rate of growth in operating overhead by 1 percentage point. Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the increase in operating overhead for fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 was mainly attributable to higher personnel costs (both increased headcount and higher compensation) to support the growth of our business, including our Other businesses and new NIKE owned retail stores. Other (Income) Expense, net Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) Other (income) expense, net $ (0.9 ) $ 4.4 (120 )% $ 29.1 (85 )% Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Other (income) expense, net is comprised substantially of gains and losses associated with the conversion of non functional currency receivables and payables, the re measurement of foreign currency derivative instruments, disposals of fixed assets, as well as other unusual or non recurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business. For fiscal 2007, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of the $14.7 million gain on the sale leaseback of our Oregon footwear distribution center and the $14.2 million benefit from the settlement of the Converse arbitration, offset by foreign currency hedge losses. The foreign currency hedge losses recognized in fiscal 2007 primarily reflect the strengthening of the euro since we entered into these hedge contracts. The change in other (income) expense, net versus the prior year period was primarily the result of foreign currency hedge losses in fiscal 2007, which were more than offset by the Converse arbitration settlement and gain on the sale of our Oregon footwear distribution center discussed above, compared to foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal 2006, which were more than offset by the $51.9 million charge taken during the fourth quarter as a result of the Converse arbitration. Foreign currency hedge gains and losses reported in other (income) expense, net are reflected in the Corporate line, the gain on the sale of the Oregon footwear distribution center is reflected in the U.S. Region line, and the Converse arbitration settlement is reflected in the Other line in our segment presentation of pre tax income in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 17 Operating Segments and Related Information). In fiscal 2007, the net foreign currency hedge losses discussed above were partially offset by favorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most notably in the EMEA Region. We estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge losses in other (income) expense, net, and the favorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits did not have a significant impact on consolidated income before income taxes for fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 The significant reduction in other (income) expense, net for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily driven by foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal 2006 compared to foreign currency hedge losses in the prior year, partially offset by the Converse arbitration charge. The fiscal 2006 hedge gains primarily reflected that the euro had weakened since we entered into these hedge contracts. 27 Table of Contents In fiscal 2006, these net foreign currency hedge gains were partially offset by unfavorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most significantly in the EMEA Region. We estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge gains in other (income) expense, net, and the unfavorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits resulted in an increase to consolidated income before income taxes of approximately $55 million for fiscal 2006 compared to the prior year. Income Taxes Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 Change Effective tax rate 32.2 % 35.0 % (280) bps 34.9 % 10 bps Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In fiscal 2007, our effective tax rate reflects tax benefits from our operations outside the United States; our tax rate on these operations is generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. These benefits included the 10 year European tax agreement finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, which is effective for fiscal years 2006 through 2015. This agreement, which provided a retroactive tax benefit for fiscal 2006 and the first quarter of fiscal 2007, favorably impacted our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was consistent with the rate reported for fiscal 2005. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, our CEO and Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan as required by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) to repatriate $500 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the U.S. by providing an 85% dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. A $500 million repatriation was made during the quarter ended May 31, 2006 comprised of both foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested. Accordingly, the provisions made did not have a material impact on the Companys income tax expense or effective tax rate for the year. Futures Orders Worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2007 were nearly 12% higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2006. This futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. The net effect from changes in currency exchange rates contributed approximately 1 percentage point to this reported futures growth versus the same period in the prior year. Excluding this currency impact, unit sales volume increases for both footwear and apparel drove the growth in overall futures and advance orders. The reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at once orders. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders, and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at once and closeout sales of NIKE footwear and apparel, wholesale sales of equipment, Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter Brands Group, Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey, NIKE Golf and retail sales across all brands. 28 Table of Contents Operating Segments The breakdown of revenues follows: Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) U.S. Region Footwear $ 4,067.2 $ 3,832.2 6 % $ 3,358.2 14 % Apparel 1,716.1 1,591.6 8 % 1,457.7 9 % Equipment 323.8 298.7 8 % 313.4 (5 )% Total U.S 6,107.1 5,722.5 7 % 5,129.3 12 % EMEA Region Footwear 2,608.0 2,454.3 6 % 2,500.0 (2 )% Apparel 1,757.2 1,559.0 13 % 1,497.1 4 % Equipment 358.1 313.3 14 % 284.5 10 % Total EMEA 4,723.3 4,326.6 9 % 4,281.6 1 % Asia Pacific Region Footwear 1,159.2 1,044.1 11 % 962.9 8 % Apparel 909.3 815.6 11 % 755.5 8 % Equipment 214.9 194.1 11 % 178.9 8 % Total Asia Pacific 2,283.4 2,053.8 11 % 1,897.3 8 % Americas Region Footwear 679.6 635.3 7 % 478.6 33 % Apparel 193.9 201.8 (4 )% 169.1 19 % Equipment 79.0 67.8 17 % 48.1 41 % Total Americas 952.5 904.9 5 % 695.8 30 % 14,066.3 13,007.8 8 % 12,004.0 8 % Other 2,259.6 1,947.1 16 % 1,735.7 12 % Total Revenues $ 16,325.9 $ 14,954.9 9 % $ 13,739.7 9 % The breakdown of income before income taxes (pre tax income) follows: Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006(1) FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005(1) FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) U.S. Region $ 1,300.3 $ 1,244.5 4 % $ 1,127.9 10 % EMEA Region 1,000.7 960.7 4 % 917.5 5 % Asia Pacific Region 483.7 412.5 17 % 399.8 3 % Americas Region 187.4 172.6 9 % 116.5 48 % Other 303.7 153.6 98 % 154.8 (1 )% Corporate (1,075.9 ) (802.3 ) (34 )% (856.7 ) 6 % Total Pre tax Income $ 2,199.9 $ 2,141.6 3 % $ 1,859.8 15 % (1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal year 2007 presentation.

We have reported pre tax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. As discussed in Note 17 Operating Segments and Related Information in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in pre tax income of our operating segments. U.S. Region Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 4,067.2 $ 3,832.2 6 % $ 3,358.2 14 % Apparel 1,716.1 1,591.6 8 % 1,457.7 9 % Equipment 323.8 298.7 8 % 313.4 (5 )% Total Revenues $ 6,107.1 $ 5,722.5 7 % $ 5,129.3 12 % Pre tax Income $ 1,300.3 $ 1,244.5 4 % $ 1,127.9 10 % Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 During fiscal 2007, the increase in U.S. footwear revenue was attributable to high single digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was driven by higher demand for our NIKE brand sport culture products; kids product, including boys and girls sport culture; Brand Jordan products; and mens running products, due to the growth of our Nike+ performance models. The decrease in average selling price per pair compared to the prior year was the result of a higher mix of off price products, combined with growth in lower priced kids product. The year over year increase in U.S. apparel revenues during fiscal 2007 reflected mid single digit growth in unit sales combined with a low single digit increase in average price per unit. The increase in unit sales versus the prior year was driven by double digit growth in NIKE brand sport performance apparel, while the improvement in average selling prices was driven by team and licensed apparel and Brand Jordan products. Pre tax income for the U.S. Region grew at a slower rate than revenue in fiscal 2007 as a result of lower gross margins. The gross margin decline was primarily attributable to a higher level of closeout sales and sales discounts compared to the prior year, most notably in our footwear business. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2006, but represented a lower percentage of revenue due to operating overhead leverage. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 During fiscal 2006, the increase in footwear revenues was due to a double digit growth in unit sales, combined with low single digit growth in the average selling price per pair. The strong unit increase was driven by increased consumer demand across a majority of the footwear product categories, most significantly high demand for our Jordan branded and sport culture products. The higher average selling price per pair was primarily due to increased consumer demand for products with a suggested retail price over $100, driven by Jordan branded products as well as NIKE branded sport performance and sport culture products. The increase in U.S. apparel sales for fiscal 2006 was driven by increased unit sales in NIKE and Jordan branded apparel, partially offset by sales declines in licensed apparel, primarily due to the expiration of our license agreement with the NBA in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The increases in NIKE branded apparel were primarily due to increased sales of sport performance products. 30 Table of Contents For the U.S. Region, the increase in pre tax income for fiscal 2006 as compared to 2005 was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, more than offsetting a lower gross margin percentage. The lower gross margin percentage was primarily the result of lower in line net pricing margins for footwear due to higher product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices, and additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2005, but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage. The increase in selling and administrative costs was due to increases in both demand creation and operating overhead. The increase in demand creation was primarily driven by increased spending on sports marketing endorsements and events and increased advertising, primarily due to the global campaigns discussed above. The increase in operating overhead spending was driven by increased spending for new NIKE owned retail stores, higher personnel costs and higher travel and meeting expenses. EMEA Region Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 2,608.0 $ 2,454.3 6 % $ 2,500.0 (2 )% Apparel 1,757.2 1,559.0 13 % 1,497.1 4 % Equipment 358.1 313.3 14 % 284.5 10 % Total Revenues $ 4,723.3 $ 4,326.6 9 % $ 4,281.6 1 % Pre tax Income $ 1,000.7 $ 960.7 4 % $ 917.5 5 % Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 For the EMEA Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 6 percentage points of the revenue growth during fiscal 2007. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, all markets within the region except the U.K. and France increased revenues during the year. The emerging markets in the region grew over 30%, driven by strong results in Greece, Russia, Turkey and South Africa. Increases in Northern Europe, Italy and Spain also contributed significantly to the revenue growth. After experiencing challenging retail conditions in the U.K. and France during fiscal 2007, we have started to see signs of improvement in these markets, including year over year futures growth. Excluding changes in exchange rates, footwear revenues increased 1 percentage point during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. The increase in footwear revenue was attributable to low single digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for our NIKE brand sport culture products, most notably metro and outdoor products. The growth in unit sales more than offset a decline in the average selling price per pair, which resulted from a shift in product mix from higher priced to lower priced product styles, combined with an increase in closeout sales. Excluding changes in exchange rates, apparel revenues increased 7 percentage points during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. The year over year increase reflected high single digit growth in unit sales, driven by both sports culture and sports performance products, combined with a low single digit increase in average price per unit. The increase in pre tax income for the EMEA Region during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the increase in revenues and favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expenses, which on a currency neutral basis, increased 4 percentage points versus fiscal 2006. The lower gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007 was attributable to an increase in warehousing costs and lower in line net pricing margins, primarily in footwear, 31 Table of Contents attributable to sales discounts, higher product costs and a shift in product mix to lower priced models. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by an increase in operating overhead, most notably normal wage inflation and growth in the emerging markets, combined with a slight increase in demand creation. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 For the EMEA Region, changes in currency exchange rates reduced revenue growth by 4 percentage points in fiscal 2006. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, all three product business units grew. Excluding currency changes, the increase in footwear revenues reflected increased unit sales partially offset by declines in the average selling price per pair. The increased unit sales were driven by increased demand for sport culture products. The declines in the average selling price per pair were due in part to changes in the mix of in line products sold towards products with a lower average selling price and higher sales incentives as a result of a difficult retail environment in Western Europe. The increase in EMEA apparel revenue was driven by increased unit sales and average selling prices of NIKE branded apparel, primarily increased unit sales of sport performance products, including soccer products driven by the World Cup, and increased average selling prices across most apparel categories. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, sales increases in the emerging markets of our Central Europe, Middle East and Africa unit led the revenue growth, while sales increases in Western and Northern Europe also contributed to the EMEA sales growth for fiscal 2006. The increase in pre tax income for the EMEA Region for fiscal 2006 was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues more than offsetting a lower gross margin percentage and unfavorable foreign currency translation versus fiscal 2005. The lower gross margin percentage was primarily the result of lower in line net pricing margins in footwear and apparel, partially offset by improved year over year hedge rates. The lower in line net pricing margins for footwear were due to higher product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices, higher sales incentives, strategies to improve consumer value, and a shift in the mix of products sold towards products with lower margins. The reduced in line net pricing margins for apparel were primarily due to higher product costs and higher sales incentives. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 were higher than in fiscal 2005 but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage. Excluding currency changes, the increase in selling and administrative costs was driven by higher demand creation expenses partially offset by slightly lower operating overhead expenses. The higher demand creation expenses were primarily due to spending related to the World Cup campaign and increased spending on retail marketing programs. The slightly lower operating overhead expenses were due to lower spending on travel and meeting expenses, lower bad debt expense and slightly lower personnel costs related to our wholesale business, partially offset by increased spending to support the growth of NIKE owned retail stores. Asia Pacific Region Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 1,159.2 $ 1,044.1 11 % $ 962.9 8 % Apparel 909.3 815.6 11 % 755.5 8 % Equipment 214.9 194.1 11 % 178.9 8 % Total Revenues $ 2,283.4 $ 2,053.8 11 % $ 1,897.3 8 % Pre tax Income $ 483.7 $ 412.5 17 % $ 399.8 3 % 32 Table of Contents Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth for fiscal 2007. While the majority of countries within the region reported double digit sales increases for the year, China continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region, as revenues increased nearly 26% on a currency neutral basis. The revenue growth in China is primarily due to expansion in both the number of stores selling NIKE product, as well as sales through existing doors. Constant currency revenues in Japan increased only slightly during fiscal 2007. Despite sustained softness in the Japan market, we are starting to see positive signs, including higher gross margins, improvements in sell through at retail and improving futures conversion trends. The growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2007 reflected increased unit sales, most notably in China and Korea, partially offset by lower average selling prices, which resulted primarily from strategies to improve consumer value in Japan and Korea, combined with a change in the mix of products sold across the region. The year over year increase in apparel revenue was also driven by increased demand in China and Korea. The increase in pre tax income for the Asia Pacific Region for fiscal 2007 was driven by higher revenues, improved gross margins and favorable foreign currency translation, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expenses. The gross margin improvement versus the prior year was primarily driven by better inventory management, improved year over year hedge rates and reduced warehousing costs. The improvement in margins was partially offset by higher sales incentives, most notably in Japan, combined with efforts to improve consumer value in Japan and Korea. The increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2007 was attributable to increased investments in demand creation, most notably the Just Do It and Force Basketball campaigns. Overall business growth across the region, combined with retail expansion in China and Korea, also contributed to an increase in operating overhead expenses. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates reduced revenue growth by 1 percentage point for fiscal 2006. Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for each Asia Pacific product business unit were higher than fiscal 2005. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenues reflected increased unit sales (driven by increased unit sales across most countries and categories), partially offset by lower average selling prices (due to strategies to improve consumer value in Japan). The increase in apparel revenues was driven by increases across sport performance and sport culture categories. Increased revenue in China (driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand) was the primary growth driver for fiscal 2006, partially offset by lower sales in Japan driven by lower average selling prices due to investments in consumer value and a challenging retail marketplace. The increase in fiscal 2006 pre tax income for the Asia Pacific Region was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage. The lower gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to lower in line net pricing margins due to higher footwear product costs, primarily the result of higher oil prices; strategies to improve consumer value for footwear in Japan; and a shift in the mix of footwear and apparel products sold in Japan toward products with lower margins. Selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 were higher than fiscal 2005, but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage. The increased selling and administrative expenses were due to increases in demand creation, primarily driven by spending related to the World Cup campaign, and slightly higher operating overhead, primarily due to higher personnel costs to support growth in China. 33 Table of Contents Americas Region Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 679.6 $ 635.3 7 % $ 478.6 33 % Apparel 193.9 201.8 (4 )% 169.1 19 % Equipment 79.0 67.8 17 % 48.1 41 % Total Revenues $ 952.5 $ 904.9 5 % $ 695.8 30 % Pre tax Income $ 187.4 $ 172.6 9 % $ 116.5 48 % Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In the Americas Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth for fiscal 2007. Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, growth in most markets within the region, led by constant currency revenue growth of 29% in Argentina, more than offset softer results in Brazil. While currency neutral footwear and equipment revenues increased 6% and 15%, respectively, versus the prior year, apparel revenues decreased 4% as a result of tough World Cup comparisons. We expect to return to apparel revenue growth in fiscal 2008 as a result of moving from a licensed to a wholesale apparel distribution model in Brazil. The increase in pre tax income for fiscal 2007 versus the prior year was primarily attributable to higher revenues and improved gross margins, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. The gross margin improvement was driven by higher in line net pricing margins resulting from fewer discounts being offered in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, combined with a change in product mix. The increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to investments in demand creation, most notably the Run Americas II and womens fitness campaigns, the World Cup and retail resources. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 In the Americas Region, 11 percentage points of the revenue growth for fiscal 2006 were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Even excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, sales in each Americas product business unit grew in fiscal 2006. The revenue growth was driven by increased sales in every country in the region, with significant sales increases in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. The increase in fiscal 2006 pre tax income for the Americas Region was attributable to higher revenues, an improved gross margin percentage, lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues and favorable currency translation. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2005, but represented a lower percentage of revenues for fiscal 2006. The increased selling and administrative expenses were due to increases in both demand creation (due to increased sports marketing endorsement contracts, and increased advertising spending and retail marketing programs primarily related to the World Cup campaign) and operating overhead (driven by increased personnel costs as a result of continued expansion of the business across the region). 34 Table of Contents Other Businesses Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs. FY06 % Change Fiscal 2005 FY06 vs. FY05 % Change (In millions) Revenues $ 2,259.6 $ 1,947.1 16 % $ 1,735.7 12 % Pre tax Income $ 303.7 $ 153.6 98 % $ 154.8 (1 )% Converse arbitration (14.2 ) 51.9 Pre tax Income, excluding the Converse arbitration $ 289.5 $ 205.5 41 % $ 154.8 33 % We are providing pre tax income excluding the Converse arbitration to enhance the visibility of the underlying earnings trend excluding these non recurring amounts. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 The increase in Other business revenues for fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by double digit revenue growth across nearly all businesses, led by Converse and NIKE Golf. In fiscal 2007, revenues at Converse increased more than 20% versus the prior year to over $550 million, driven by strong consumer demand in the United States and internationally, while NIKE Golf grew 12% to nearly $650 million. During fiscal 2007, improved profitability at Converse, driven by increased wholesale revenues in the United States and growth in our international licensing business, combined with growth at NIKE Golf, contributed to the increase in pre tax income versus fiscal 2006. As previously discussed, fiscal 2007 results include the benefit of the $14.2 million settlement of the arbitration ruling involving Converse and a former South American licensee, as discussed below. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenue increases for our Other businesses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 were driven primarily by growth at Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf. Pre tax income from the Other businesses for fiscal 2006 was consistent with fiscal 2005 and included a $51.9 million charge related to the unfavorable arbitration ruling involving a licensing agreement contract dispute with our Converse subsidiary and a former South American licensee. This charge reduced reported pre tax income for the Other businesses by 33 percentage points. Excluding the Converse arbitration charge, the pre tax income improvement was driven by improved profitability at Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf, partially offset by a loss at NIKE Bauer Hockey. The loss at NIKE Bauer Hockey was largely the result of costs incurred in connection with a re branding initiative. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal 2007 Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $1.9 billion in fiscal 2007, compared to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2006. Our primary source of operating cash flow was net income of $1.5 billion, and non cash depreciation and stock based compensation, offset by investments in working capital and other assets and liabilities to support growth in the business. The increase in working capital during fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the timing of payments, while the increase in inventories reflects year over year growth in reported futures and higher inventories to support the expansion of NIKE owned retail stores, slightly offset by better inventory management. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the timing of payments and inventory receipts compared to the prior year. 35 Table of Contents Cash provided by investing activities was $0.1 billion during fiscal 2007, compared to $1.3 billion used in investing activities during fiscal 2006. The year over year change was due to a net decrease of $382.4 million in short term investments during fiscal 2007, compared to a net increase of $909.9 million in short term investments during fiscal 2006. The decrease in short term investments was the result of a strategic shift to highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less. Cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion during fiscal 2007, compared to $0.9 billion used in fiscal 2006. The increase versus fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the $250 million repayment of corporate bonds, combined with an increase in share repurchases, discussed below, partially offset by an increase in notes payable, proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and exercise of stock options. In fiscal 2007, we purchased approximately 22.1 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for $975.3 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, 4.0 million of the shares repurchased completed the previous four year, $1.5 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2004. As of the end of fiscal 2007, we have repurchased 18.1 million shares for $812.7 million under the new $3 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in June 2006. We expect to fund share repurchases from operating cash flow, excess cash, and or debt. The timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the programs will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal 2007 were $0.71, compared to $0.59 in fiscal 2006. We have paid a dividend every quarter since February 1984. Our current dividend policy is to provide an annual dividend equal to 20% to 30% of the trailing twelve months earnings per share, paid out on a quarterly basis. We review our dividend policy from time to time, and based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements, we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items that fall under the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2007, and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, Description of Commitment 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 260.9 $ 219.9 $ 183.3 $ 156.7 $ 128.4 $ 587.0 $ 1,536.2 Long term Debt 30.5 5.5 30.5 5.5 133.0 236.5 441.5 Endorsement Contracts(1) 541.0 483.2 398.7 310.5 268.6 792.1 2,794.1 Product Purchase Obligations(2) 2,063.4 0.3 2,063.7 Other(3),(4) 269.8 51.3 10.7 3.2 1.1 0.9 337.0 Total $ 3,165.6 $ 760.2 $ 623.2 $ 475.9 $ 531.1 $ 1,616.5 $ 7,172.5 (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for 36 Table of Contents bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE products for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. (2) We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2007. (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2007. (4) Included in Other is a commitment to an outsourcing contractor that provides us with information technology operations management services for fiscal 2008 and part of fiscal 2009. The amount of future payments depends on our level of monthly usage of the different elements of the contractors services. If we were to terminate the entire contract as of May 31, 2007, we would be required to provide the contractor with four months notice and pay a termination fee of $16.3 million. Our monthly payments to the contractor currently approximate $5.3 million. We also have the following outstanding short term debt obligations as of May 31, 2007. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 6 Short Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as of May 31, 2007 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ 100.8 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 44.6 As of May 31, 2007, letters of credit of $165.9 million were outstanding, generally for the purchase of inventory. Capital Resources In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which $1 billion in debt securities may be issued. In May 2002, we commenced a medium term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to $500 million in medium term notes, as our capital needs dictate. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements and since commencement of the medium term note program we have issued $240.0 million in medium term notes. 37 Table of Contents During fiscal 2007, no medium term notes were issued under the program. We may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2008 depending on general corporate needs. During fiscal 2007, one of the Companys Japanese subsidiaries entered into a 3.0 billion yen (approximately $24.7 million as of May 31, 2007) loan facility that replaced certain intercompany borrowings. The interest rate on the facility is based on the six month Japanese Yen London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread, resulting in an all in rate of 0.805% at May 31, 2007. The facility expires on December 31, 2007 unless both parties agree to an extension. During fiscal 2007, the Companys same Japanese subsidiary entered into a 5.0 billion yen (approximately $41.1 million as of May 31, 2007) term loan that replaces certain intercompany borrowings and matures on February 14, 2012. The interest rate on the loan is approximately 1.5% and interest is paid semi annually. As of May 31, 2007, we had a multi year $1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks, and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the facility. The facility matures in December 2011, and can be extended for one additional year on both the first and second anniversary date. Based on our current long term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A2 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.15%. The facility fee is 0.05% of the total commitment. If our long term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, and set a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2007, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which there was no amount outstanding at May 31, 2007 or May 31, 2006. We currently have short term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively. We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation) (EITF 06 3). EITF 06 3 requires disclosure of the method of accounting for the applicable assessed taxes and the amount of assessed taxes that are included in revenues if they are accounted for under the gross method. EITF 06 3 was adopted in the fourth quarter ended May 31, 2007; however, since we present revenues net of any taxes collected from customers, no additional disclosures were required. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (FAS 158). FAS 158 requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with single employer defined benefit pension, retiree healthcare and other postretirement plans in their financial statements. We adopted the provisions of FAS 158 in the fourth quarter ended May 31, 2007. See Note 38 Table of Contents 12 Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the adoption of FAS 158. In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires public companies to quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement as material, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered. The adoption of SAB 108 at May 31, 2007 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2007. We have evaluated the provisions of FIN 48 and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on EITF Issue No. 06 2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43 (EITF 06 2). EITF 06 2 clarifies recognition guidance on the accrual of employees rights to compensated absences under a sabbatical or other similar benefit arrangement. The provisions of EITF 06 2 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2007 and will be applied through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. We have evaluated the provisions of EITF 06 2 and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of FAS 157 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (FAS 159). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The provisions of FAS 159 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 159. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since 39 Table of Contents our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. 40 Table of Contents Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and is depreciated over its estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property, plant and equipment may be impaired, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value. Any impairment charges are recorded within other (income) expense, net. We estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance. Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142), goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. As required by FAS 142, in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value, we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value. Our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors, including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units. Our estimates 41 Table of Contents may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological change, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods. Any impairment charge related to goodwill would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and any impairment charge related to other indefinite lived intangible assets would be classified within other (income) expense, net. Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. In these cases, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value. Any significant impairment charges would be classified within other (income) expense, net. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions, as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance. When specific criteria required by SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted (FAS 133), have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions changes significantly, we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which such changes occur. Once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction. Stock based Compensation As of the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we account for stock based compensation in accordance with FAS 123R. Under the provisions of FAS 123R, the fair value of stock based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods, stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carryforwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. 42 Table of Contents In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding significant or infrequently occurring items, to determine the year to date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. We disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Therefore, actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (income) expense, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. 43 Table of Contents We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party and intercompany transactions. When we begin hedging exposures, the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months, although at May 31, 2007 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 18 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our European subsidiary. We use forward contracts to hedge non functional currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros, British pounds, Japanese yen, Korean won, Canadian dollars and Mexican pesos. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of medium and long term fixed rate debt, commercial paper, and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value at Risk (VaR). Our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the SEC, are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only, and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $13.7 million and $17.5 million at May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006, respectively. The decrease in VaR as of May 31, 2007 occurred due to a lower notional value of outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments as of May 31, 2007 compared to May 31, 2006. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being 44 Table of Contents hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $36.5 million and $34.9 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Details of other market sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the VaR calculation above are provided in the table below, except the interest rate swaps which are described below. These instruments include intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.

Intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts with third parties, as discussed above. The fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries. Accordingly, the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary. There were no significant changes in debt market risks during fiscal 2007. We did not issue any long term fixed rate corporate bonds during fiscal 2007 or 2006; however, in previous years we issued a total of $240 million in long term fixed rate corporate bonds that mature between July 2007 and October 2015. Fixed interest 45 Table of Contents rates on these bonds range from 4.7% to 5.66%. For each of the bonds issued, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the three month or six month LIBOR plus a spread. As a result of the interest rate swap agreements, the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was 5.38% at May 31, 2007 and 6.07% at May 31, 2006. For $190 million of the issued bonds, the associated swaps have the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond. These interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges, so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt. The remaining $50 million bond matures in October 2013, whereas the associated interest rate swap expired in October 2006. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of this swap were recorded in net income each period. The recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges was a net loss of $2.6 million and $5.6 million at May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006, respectively, and a $9.0 million gain at May 31, 2005. The change in fair value of the $50 million interest rate swap that expired in October 2006 was not material for the years ended May 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. In fiscal 2003 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a Japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our Japanese subsidiaries. The Japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on 3 month LIBOR plus a spread. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at 0.8% and receives variable interest payments based on 3 month LIBOR plus a spread based on a notional amount of 8.0 billion Japanese yen. This interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period. The change in fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended May 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.
