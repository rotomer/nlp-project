Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview NIKE designs, develops and markets high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts, NIKE owned retail, including stores and e commerce, and independent distributors, franchisees and licensees in the United States and worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to create long term revenue growth by creating compelling consumer experiences by creating and delivering innovative, must have products; deep personal connections with our brands; and compelling retail presentation. We strive to convert revenue growth to shareholder value by driving operating excellence in several key areas: Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, through operational discipline Reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing and product design that strives to eliminate waste Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of brands to eliminate duplicative costs Improving working capital efficiency Deploying capital effectively to create value for our shareholders By executing this strategy, we aim to deliver the following long term financial goals: High single digit revenue growth; Mid teens earnings per share growth; 21 Table of Contents Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows; and Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. In fiscal 2008 we met or exceeded these financial goals. Our revenues grew 14% to $18.6 billion, net income grew 26% to $1.9 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $3.74, a 28% increase versus fiscal 2007. These reported results included combined gains from the sale of our Starter Brand and NIKE Bauer Hockey businesses of $35.4 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2008 and the gain recognized on the sale leaseback of the Oregon Footwear Distribution Center of $10.0 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2007, one time tax benefits of $105.4 million and $25.5 million recognized in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, operational losses of $13.3 million, net of tax, from Umbro, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, and a $9.6 million gain, net of tax, from the Converse arbitration ruling settlement in fiscal 2007. We estimate that the combination of favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits from international businesses and the foreign currency losses included in other (expense) income, net resulted in a year over year increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately 6%. For the year, the increase in net income was higher than our rate of revenue growth due to a reduction in our effective tax rate and improved gross margins, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. Fiscal 2008 results were positively affected by a reduction in our effective tax rate of 7.4 percentage points as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of the $105.4 million one time tax benefit received in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Also reflected in the year over year effective tax rate improvement was a reduction in our ongoing effective tax rate resulting from our profits earned outside of the United States; our effective tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Gross margins for the year grew 110 basis points versus the prior year as inventory management and strategic price increases were partially offset by higher product costs and increased close out sales. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was attributable to higher investments in growth drivers such as athlete and sport team endorsers of our products, spending around major sporting events, key product initiatives, investments in company owned retail and non NIKE brand businesses as well as normal wage increases. Our earnings per share for the year grew at a higher rate than net income given lower outstanding shares due to repurchases made under our share repurchase program. In addition, we increased cash flow from operations and continued to return larger amounts of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and increased cash paid for share repurchases. Our return on invested capital increased as compared to fiscal 2007. Although we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above in any particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year, we continue to believe these are appropriate long term goals.

Strong demand for NIKE brand products continued to drive revenue growth, as all four of our geographic regions and, on a consolidated basis, all three of our product business units delivered revenue growth. The U.S. Region contributed nearly 2 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2008. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, our international regions contributed nearly 7 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2008, as all of our international regions posted higher revenues. Our Other businesses, comprised of results from Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter Brands Group (whose primary business was the Starter brand business which was sold on December 17, 2007), Hurley International, NIKE Bauer Hockey (which was sold on April 17, 2008), NIKE Golf, and Umbro (which was acquired on March 3, 2008) contributed the remaining consolidated constant currency revenue growth, as Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf posted higher year over year revenues. By product group, our worldwide NIKE brand footwear revenue grew 14% and contributed more than $1.2 billion of incremental revenue for fiscal 2008. Our worldwide NIKE branded apparel and equipment businesses reported revenue growth of 14% and 10% for the year, respectively, and combined added approximately $750 million of incremental revenue. Our Other Businesses reported revenue growth of 15% and combined added more than $330 million of incremental revenue. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 During fiscal 2007, changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed 2 percentage points of consolidated revenue growth. All four of our geographic regions and, on a consolidated basis, all three of our product business units delivered revenue growth. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, both the U.S. Region and our international regions each contributed more than 2.5 percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2007. Sales in our Other businesses contributed the remaining 2 percentage points of the consolidated constant currency revenue growth, as each business within the group posted higher revenues. By product group, our worldwide NIKE brand footwear revenue grew 7% and contributed nearly $550 million of incremental revenue for fiscal 2007. Our worldwide NIKE branded apparel and equipment businesses reported revenue growth of 10% and 12% for the year, respectively, and combined added more than $500 million of incremental revenue. Gross Margin Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06Change (In millions) Gross Margin $ 8,387.4 $ 7,160.5 17% $ 6,587.0 9% Gross Margin % 45.0 % 43.9 % 110 bps 44.0 % (10)bps 23 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 During fiscal 2008, the primary factors contributing to the 110 basis point increase in the consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year were as follows: (1) Higher footwear in line gross pricing margins, most notably in the U.S. Region, primarily due to strategic price increases; (2) Improved hedge rates relative to the prior year, primarily in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Region; (3) Higher footwear close out net pricing margins, most notably in the EMEA Region, primarily due to better inventory management. The factors driving an increased gross margin percentage were partially offset by lower apparel in line gross pricing margins primarily driven by higher product costs, most notably in the U.S. and EMEA Regions, and increased apparel close out sales, primarily in the U.S. Region. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 During fiscal 2007, the primary factors contributing to the 10 basis point decrease in the consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year were as follows: (1) Lower footwear close out net pricing margins in the U.S. and EMEA Regions, primarily due to sales discounts, combined with a higher close out mix; partially offset by (2) Improved hedge rates relative to the prior year, primarily in the EMEA and Asia Pacific Regions; (3) Better inventory management, most notably in our Asia Pacific Region; and (4) Improved gross margins in our Other businesses, driven primarily by the growth in Converses international licensing business, partially offset by the expected effects of the transition in Exeters business from a licensing model to a wholesale model. Selling and Administrative Expense Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06Change (In millions) Operating overhead expense(1) 3,645.4 3,116.3 17% 2,737.6 14% Demand creation expense(2) 2,308.3 1,912.4 21% 1,740.2 10% Selling and administrative expense 5,953.7 5,028.7 18% 4,477.8 12% % of Revenues 32 % 30.8 % 120 bps 29.9 % 90 bps (1) Fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 operating overhead expense includes charges related to stock based compensation associated with stock options and ESPP shares issued to employees and expensed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R Share Based Payment (FAS 123R). We adopted FAS 123R during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 using the modified prospective transition method. This expense was not reflected in our results of operations for fiscal 2006. (See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) (2) Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. 24 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In fiscal 2008, selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues by 120 basis points, driven primarily by strategic investments in both demand creation and operating overhead. Changes in currency exchange rates increased selling and administrative expense growth by four percentage points. On a constant currency basis, demand creation expense increased 15% versus the prior year. The year over year increase was primarily attributable to investments in athlete and sport team endorsers of our products, spending around major sporting events including the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and the European Football Championships, key product initiatives such as Mens Training in the U.S. and retail presentation. Excluding the effects of changes in exchange rates, operating overhead increased 14% versus the prior year. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in growth drivers such as NIKE owned retail, non NIKE brand businesses, emerging markets and normal wage inflation and performance compensation. We believe total selling and administrative expenses will grow faster than our rate of revenue growth in fiscal 2009 driven primarily by strategic investments in demand creation, including spending around the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and the European Football Championships and increased investments in athlete and team endorsers of our products. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In fiscal 2007, selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues by 90 basis points; however, excluding the $141.9 million pre tax charge relating to the change in accounting for stock based compensation, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was consistent with the prior year. On a constant currency basis, demand creation expense increased 7% versus the prior year. The year over year increase was primarily attributable to investments in the NIKE Air&reg;, NIKE+, NIKE Pro, and Force Basketball campaigns. For fiscal year 2007, constant currency growth in demand creation expense was consistent with our constant currency revenue growth. Excluding stock based compensation expense and the effects of changes in exchange rates, operating overhead increased 7%, which was in line with our constant currency revenue growth. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in growth drivers such as NIKE owned retail and non NIKE brands, as well as normal wage inflation and performance based compensation. Other (Expense) Income, net Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06% Change (In millions) Other (expense) income, net $ (7.9 ) $ 0.9 978 % $ (4.4 ) 120 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Other (expense) income, net is comprised substantially of gains and losses from hedging and re measurement of non functional currency balances, disposals of fixed assets, as well as other unusual or non recurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business. Foreign currency hedge gains and losses reported in other (expense) income, net are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment presentation of pre tax income in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 17 Operating Segments and Related Information). In fiscal 2008, other (expense) income, net included foreign currency hedge losses that were partially offset by the $32.0 million gain on the sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey and the $28.6 million gain on the sale of the Starter 25 Table of Contents brand business. Other (expense) income, net in fiscal 2007 is primarily comprised of the $14.7 million gain on the sale leaseback of our Oregon footwear distribution center and the $14.2 million benefit from the settlement of the Converse arbitration, partially offset by foreign currency hedge losses. In fiscal 2008, we estimate that the combination of favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits from international businesses and the foreign currency losses included in other (expense) income, net resulted in a year over year increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately $122 million. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 For fiscal 2007, other (expense) income, net was primarily comprised of the $14.7 million gain on the sale leaseback of our Oregon footwear distribution center and the $14.2 million benefit from the settlement of the Converse arbitration, offset by foreign currency hedge losses. The foreign currency hedge losses recognized in fiscal 2007 primarily reflect the strengthening of the Euro since we entered into these hedge contracts. The change in other (expense) income, net versus the prior year period was primarily the result of foreign currency hedge losses in fiscal 2007, which were more than offset by the Converse arbitration settlement and gain on the sale of our Oregon footwear distribution center discussed above, compared to foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal 2006, which were more than offset by the $51.9 million charge taken during the fourth quarter as a result of the Converse arbitration. The gain on the sale of the Oregon footwear distribution center is reflected in the U.S. Region line and the Converse arbitration settlement is reflected in the Other line in our segment presentation of pre tax income in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 17 Operating Segments and Related Information). In fiscal 2007, the net foreign currency hedge losses discussed above were partially offset by favorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits, most notably in the EMEA Region. We estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge losses in other (expense) income, net, and the favorable U.S. dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits did not have a significant impact on consolidated income before income taxes for fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. Income Taxes Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06Change Effective tax rate 24.8 % 32.2 % (740) bps 35.0 % (280) bps Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 24.8%, 7.4 percentage points lower than the prior year. Over the last few years, several of our international entities generated losses for which we did not recognize the corresponding tax benefits, as the realization of those benefits was uncertain. In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we took steps necessary to realize these benefits, resulting in a one time tax benefit of $105.4 million. Also reflected in the year over year effective tax rate improvement was a reduction in our on going effective tax rate resulting from our profits earned outside the United States; our effective tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In fiscal 2007, our effective tax rate reflects tax benefits from our operations outside the United States; our tax rate on these operations is generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. These benefits included the 10 year European tax agreement finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, which is effective for fiscal years 2006 through 2015. This agreement, which provided a retroactive tax benefit for fiscal 2006 and the first quarter of fiscal 2007, favorably impacted our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007. 26 Table of Contents Futures Orders Worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2008 were more than 11% higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2007. This futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. The net effect from changes in currency exchange rates contributed approximately 3 percentage points to this reported futures growth versus the same period in the prior year. Excluding this currency impact, unit sales volume increases for both footwear and apparel drove the growth in overall futures and advance orders. The reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at once orders. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders, and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at once and close out sales of NIKE footwear and apparel, wholesale sales of equipment, Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, Umbro, NIKE Golf and retail sales across all brands.

U.S. Region Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 4,326.8 $ 4,067.2 6 % $ 3,832.2 6 % Apparel 1,745.1 1,716.1 2 % 1,591.6 8 % Equipment 306.1 323.8 (5 )% 298.7 8 % Total Revenues $ 6,378.0 $ 6,107.1 4 % $ 5,722.5 7 % Pre tax Income $ 1,391.9 $ 1,367.3 2 % $ 1,315.2 4 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 During fiscal 2008, the increase in U.S. footwear revenue was the result of low single digit growth in unit sales and a slight increase in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales and average selling price per pair was driven by higher demand for our NIKE brand sportswear products and Brand Jordan products, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our NIKE brand basketball products. The increase in average selling price per pair was also attributable to strategic price increases and an increased sales mix of higher priced NIKE brand sportswear and Brand Jordan products. The year over year increase in U.S. apparel revenues during fiscal 2008 reflected an increase in unit sales, mostly offset by lower average selling prices. The increase in unit sales was primarily driven by higher close out sales and increased demand for NIKE brand sports performance products, partially offset by lower unit sales of sportswear and Brand Jordan products. Average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of a higher mix of close out sales. The year over year decrease in U.S. equipment revenues during fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of lower unit sales of accessory products and fewer close out sales. 28 Table of Contents Pre tax income for the U.S. Region grew at a slower rate than revenue in fiscal 2008 as a result of higher demand creation and operating overhead expenses, partially offset by higher gross margins, driven by footwear. The increase in demand creation was driven by higher sports marketing expenses and investments in the retail presentation of our key wholesale customers. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in NIKE owned retail and normal wage inflation. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 During fiscal 2007, the increase in U.S. footwear revenue was attributable to high single digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was driven by higher demand for our NIKE brand sportswear products; kids product, including boys and girls sportswear; Brand Jordan products; and mens running products, due to the growth of our Nike+ performance models. The decrease in average selling price per pair compared to the prior year was the result of a higher mix of off price products, combined with growth in lower priced kids product. The year over year increase in U.S. apparel revenues during fiscal 2007 reflected mid single digit growth in unit sales combined with a low single digit increase in average price per unit. The increase in unit sales versus the prior year was driven by double digit growth in NIKE brand sport performance apparel, while the improvement in average selling prices was driven by team and licensed apparel and Brand Jordan products. Pre tax income for the U.S. Region grew at a slower rate than revenue in fiscal 2007 as a result of lower gross margins. The gross margin decline was primarily attributable to a higher level of close out sales and sales discounts compared to the prior year, most notably in our footwear business. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2006, but represented a lower percentage of revenue due to operating overhead leverage. EMEA Region Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 3,112.6 $ 2,608.0 19 % $ 2,454.3 6 % Apparel 2,083.5 1,757.2 19 % 1,559.0 13 % Equipment 424.3 358.1 18 % 313.3 14 % Total Revenues $ 5,620.4 $ 4,723.3 19 % $ 4,326.6 9 % Pre tax Income $ 1,266.2 $ 1,036.2 22 % $ 992.6 4 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 For the EMEA Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 11 percentage points of the revenue growth during fiscal 2008. Nearly all markets within the region increased revenues during the year. The emerging markets in the region grew nearly 25%, driven by strong results in Russia, Turkey and South Africa. Increases in Northern Europe and the U.K. also contributed significantly to the revenue growth. Excluding changes in exchange rates, footwear revenues increased 8 percentage points during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year. The increase in footwear revenue was attributable to double digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a low single digit decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for our NIKE brand soccer and sportswear products. The decrease in average selling price per pair resulted from a shift in product mix from higher priced to lower priced product models, most notably within our NIKE brand sportswear product lines. 29 Table of Contents On a currency neutral basis, EMEA apparel revenue increased 8 percentage points during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of increased unit sales and a slight increase in average selling prices. The increase in unit sales was driven primarily by increased demand for sports performance products, most notably soccer. The increase in pre tax income for the EMEA Region during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the increase in revenues, favorable foreign currency translation and a higher gross margin percentage, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to improved year over year hedge rates and improved margins on close out product. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was driven by an increase in demand creation spending, primarily attributable to spending around the European Football Championships. As a result of retail expansion and overall business growth across the region, operating overhead expenses increased for the year, but at a slower rate than revenue growth. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 For the EMEA Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 6 percentage points of the revenue growth during fiscal 2007. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, all markets within the region except the U.K. and France increased revenues during the year. The emerging markets in the region grew over 30%, driven by strong results in Greece, Russia, Turkey and South Africa. Increases in Northern Europe, Italy and Spain also contributed significantly to the revenue growth. After experiencing challenging retail conditions in the U.K. and France during fiscal 2007, we have started to see signs of improvement in these markets, including year over year futures growth. Excluding changes in exchange rates, footwear revenues increased 1 percentage point during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. The increase in footwear revenue was attributable to low single digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for our NIKE brand sport culture products, most notably metro and outdoor products. The growth in unit sales more than offset a decline in the average selling price per pair, which resulted from a shift in product mix from higher priced to lower priced product styles, combined with an increase in close out sales. Excluding changes in exchange rates, apparel revenues increased 7 percentage points during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. The year over year increase reflected high single digit growth in unit sales, driven by both sports culture and sports performance products, combined with a low single digit increase in average price per unit. The increase in pre tax income for the EMEA Region during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the increase in revenues and favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expenses, which on a currency neutral basis, increased 4 percentage points versus fiscal 2006. The lower gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007 was attributable to an increase in warehousing costs and lower in line net pricing margins, primarily in footwear, attributable to sales discounts, higher product costs and a shift in product mix to lower priced models. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by an increase in operating overhead, most notably normal wage inflation and growth in the emerging markets, combined with a slight increase in demand creation. 30 Table of Contents Asia Pacific Region Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 1,499.5 $ 1,159.2 29 % $ 1,044.1 11 % Apparel 1,140.0 909.3 25 % 815.6 11 % Equipment 242.2 214.9 13 % 194.1 11 % Total Revenues $ 2,881.7 $ 2,283.4 26 % $ 2,053.8 11 % Pre tax Income $ 692.6 $ 508.3 36 % $ 436.4 16 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 6 percentage points of revenue growth for fiscal 2008. Nearly all countries across the region delivered revenue growth on a currency neutral basis. China continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region as fiscal 2008 revenues increased 50% on a currency neutral basis, driven by the expansion in both the number of stores selling NIKE product and sales through existing stores. Constant currency revenues in Japan increased at a low single digit rate during fiscal 2008. Footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2008 reflected increased unit sales, most notably in China, partially offset by lower average selling prices driven primarily by a shift in mix from higher priced to lower priced models. The year over year increase in apparel revenue was driven by increased demand in China. The increase in pre tax income for the Asia Pacific Region for fiscal 2008 was driven by higher revenues, improved gross margins and favorable foreign currency translation, which more than offset slightly higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. The gross margin improvement versus the prior year was primarily driven by reduced warehousing costs, improved year over year currency hedge rates and improved margins on close out product. The increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to spending around the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Overall business growth across the region combined with retail expansion, primarily in China, also contributed to an increase in operating overhead expenses, which grew slightly slower than revenues. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth for fiscal 2007. While the majority of countries within the region reported double digit sales increases for the year, China continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region, as revenues increased nearly 26% on a currency neutral basis. The revenue growth in China is primarily due to expansion in both the number of stores selling NIKE product, as well as sales through existing doors. Constant currency revenues in Japan increased only slightly during fiscal 2007. Despite sustained softness in the Japan market, we are starting to see positive signs, including higher gross margins, improvements in sell through at retail and improving futures conversion trends. The growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2007 reflected increased unit sales, most notably in China and Korea, partially offset by lower average selling prices, which resulted primarily from strategies to improve consumer value in Japan and Korea, combined with a change in the mix of products sold across the region. The year over year increase in apparel revenue was also driven by increased demand in China and Korea. The increase in pre tax income for the Asia Pacific Region for fiscal 2007 was driven by higher revenues, improved gross margins and favorable foreign currency translation, which more than offset higher selling and 31 Table of Contents administrative expenses. The gross margin improvement versus the prior year was primarily driven by better inventory management, improved year over year hedge rates and reduced warehousing costs. The improvement in margins was partially offset by higher sales incentives, most notably in Japan, combined with efforts to improve consumer value in Japan and Korea. The increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2007 was attributable to increased investments in demand creation, most notably the Just Do It and Force Basketball campaigns. Overall business growth across the region, combined with retail expansion in China and Korea, also contributed to an increase in operating overhead expenses. Americas Region Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 792.7 $ 679.6 17 % $ 635.3 7 % Apparel 265.4 193.9 37 % 201.8 (4 )% Equipment 96.0 79.0 22 % 67.8 17 % Total Revenues $ 1,154.1 $ 952.5 21 % $ 904.9 5 % Pre tax Income $ 239.3 $ 192.7 24 % $ 177.6 9 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In the Americas Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 7 percentage points of revenue growth for fiscal 2008. Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Americas Region reported growth in all markets, led by Argentina, Mexico and Brazil. The increase in pre tax income for fiscal 2008 versus the prior year was primarily attributable to higher revenues, improved gross margins and operating overhead leverage, combined with favorable foreign currency translation. These factors were partially offset by higher demand creation spending as a percentage of revenue. The gross margin improvement was driven primarily by higher in line net pricing margins resulting from a better mix of products sold and fewer discounts offered in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The increase in demand creation spending during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to investments in sports marketing, most notably in soccer, brand events including spending around Run Americas III and investments in the retail presentation of NIKE + and NIKE Pro products. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 In the Americas Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth for fiscal 2007. Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, growth in most markets within the region, led by constant currency revenue growth of 29% in Argentina, more than offset softer results in Brazil. While currency neutral footwear and equipment revenues increased 6% and 15%, respectively, versus the prior year, apparel revenues decreased 4% as a result of tough World Cup comparisons. We expect to return to apparel revenue growth in fiscal 2008 as a result of moving from a licensed to a wholesale apparel distribution model in Brazil. The increase in pre tax income for fiscal 2007 versus the prior year was primarily attributable to higher revenues and improved gross margins, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. The gross margin improvement was driven by higher in line net pricing margins resulting from fewer discounts being offered in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, combined with a change in product mix. The increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to investments in demand creation, most notably the Run Americas II and womens fitness campaigns, the World Cup and retail resources. 32 Table of Contents Other Businesses Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change Fiscal 2006 FY07 vs.FY06% Change (In millions) Revenues $ 2,592.8 $ 2,259.6 15 % $ 1,947.1 16 % Pre tax Income $ 336.4 $ 299.7 12 % $ 153.6 95 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 The increase in Other business revenues was driven by higher revenues across all businesses, most notably Converse and NIKE Golf. In fiscal 2008, revenues at Converse increased more than 29% versus the prior year to approximately $729 million, driven by strong consumer demand in the United States and internationally, while NIKE Golf grew 12% to nearly $725 million. Revenues at Cole Haan increased 6% to $496 million, driven by strong results at company owned retail stores. Revenues at Hurley increased 14% to $171 million. During fiscal 2008, growth at Converse and NIKE Golf, combined with margin improvements across most businesses drove the year over year increase in pre tax income. Fiscal 2007 pre tax income included a $14.2 million benefit relating to the settlement of an arbitration ruling involving Converse and a former South American licensee. Fiscal 2008 pre tax income for our Other businesses would have increased approximately 18% versus fiscal 2007 excluding this favorable settlement. As part of our long term growth strategy, we continually evaluate our existing portfolio of businesses as well as new business opportunities to ensure the Company is investing in those businesses with the largest growth potential and highest returns. On March 3, 2008 we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Umbro Plc (Umbro), a leading United Kingdom based global soccer brand, for a purchase price of &pound;290.5 million in cash (approximately $576.4 million), inclusive of direct transaction costs. This acquisition is intended to significantly strengthen our market position in the United Kingdom and expand NIKEs global leadership in soccer, a key area of growth for the Company. This acquisition also provides scaled positions in emerging soccer markets such as China, Russia and Brazil. The results of Umbros operations have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and in the Other operating segment since the date of acquisition. Umbro, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange prior to our acquisition, reported in their 2006 annual report that revenues for calendar year 2006 were approximately $276 million (&pound;149.5 million), and estimated that the combination of Umbros calendar year 2006 wholesale revenue and estimated sales revenue earned by Umbros licensees from the sale of Umbro products totaled approximately $755 million (&pound;409.4 million). Following a strategic review of the Companys existing business portfolio, we concluded that the Starter and Bauer Hockey businesses did not align with our long term growth priorities. On December 17, 2007 we completed the sale of the Starter brand business for $60 million in cash. On April 17, 2008 we completed the sale of the Bauer Hockey business for net proceeds of $189.2 million after working capital adjustments. These transactions resulted in gains of approximately $28.6 million and $32.0 million, respectively, which are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment presentation of pre tax income in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 17 Operating Segments). Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 The increase in Other business revenues for fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by double digit revenue growth across nearly all businesses, led by Converse and NIKE Golf. In fiscal 2007, revenues at Converse increased more than 20% versus the prior year to over $550 million, driven by strong consumer demand in the United States and internationally, while NIKE Golf grew 12% to nearly $650 million. 33 Table of Contents During fiscal 2007, improved profitability at Converse, driven by increased wholesale revenues in the United States and growth in our international licensing business, combined with growth at NIKE Golf, contributed to the increase in pre tax income versus fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 results also include the benefit of the $14.2 million settlement of the arbitration ruling involving Converse and a former South American licensee. This dispute was settled during the first quarter ended August 31, 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Fiscal 2008 Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was approximately $1.9 billion in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. Our primary source of operating cash flow in fiscal 2008 was net income of $1.9 billion. Adjustments for non cash depreciation and stock based compensation were offset by increases in deferred income taxes as well as investments in working capital and other assets and liabilities to support growth in the business. The increase in working capital during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to an increase in inventories and accounts receivable, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable is attributable to higher sales in the last quarter of 2008. The increase in inventories reflects year over year growth in reported futures and higher inventories to support the expansion of NIKE owned retail stores, slightly offset by better inventory management. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the timing of payments and inventory receipts compared to the prior year. Cash used by investing activities was $0.4 billion during fiscal 2008, compared to $0.1 billion provided by investing activities during fiscal 2007. The year over year increase in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to our acquisition of Umbro for approximately $0.6 billion offset by proceeds from the divestitures of our NIKE Bauer Hockey and Starter brand businesses of $0.2 billion. Cash used in financing activities was $1.2 billion during fiscal 2008, compared to $1.1 billion used in fiscal 2007. The increase versus fiscal 2007 was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases and dividends paid, discussed below, partially offset by a decrease in payments of long term debt as we made a $250 million repayment of corporate bonds in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 20.6 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for $1.2 billion. As of the end of fiscal 2008, we have repurchased 38.6 million shares for $2.1 billion under the $3 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in June 2006. We expect to fund share repurchases from operating cash flow, excess cash and or debt. The timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the programs will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal 2008 were $0.875, compared to $0.71 in fiscal 2007. We have paid a dividend every quarter since February 1984. Our current dividend policy is to provide an annual dividend equal to 20% to 30% of the trailing twelve months earnings per share, paid out on a quarterly basis. We review our dividend policy from time to time, and based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements, we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items that fall under the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our significant long term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2008, and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, Description of Commitment 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 312.4 $ 264.4 $ 228.9 $ 192.1 $ 163.9 $ 692.3 $ 1,854.0 Long term Debt 6.3 31.3 6.3 153.4 46.3 197.5 441.1 Endorsement Contracts(1) 700.4 599.3 518.3 480.3 407.2 1,122.0 3,827.5 Product Purchase Obligations(2) 2,272.0 1.9 2,273.9 Other(3) 250.7 76.4 62.6 55.1 50.7 1.2 496.7 Total $ 3,541.8 $ 973.3 $ 816.1 $ 880.9 $ 668.1 $ 2,013.0 $ 8,893.2 (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE products for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. (2) We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2008. (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2008. The total long term liability for uncertain tax positions was $251.1 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2008. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. 35 Table of Contents We also have the following outstanding short term debt obligations as of May 31, 2008. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 6 Short Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as ofMay 31, 2008 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ 177.7 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 65.9 As of May 31, 2008, letters of credit of $193.4 million were outstanding, generally for the purchase of inventory. Capital Resources In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC under which $1 billion in debt securities may be issued. In May 2002, we commenced a medium term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to $500.0 million in medium term notes as our capital needs dictate. We entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements and since commencement of the program have issued $240.0 million in medium term notes. As of May 31, 2008, $215.0 million in medium term notes remained outstanding. We may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2009 depending on general corporate needs. During fiscal 2008, one of our Japanese subsidiaries entered into a total of &yen;5.0 billion (approximately $47.4 million as of May 31, 2008) in short term loans to meet general operating needs. The interest rates on the loans are based on the prevailing Tokyo Interbank Offer Rate of our election plus a spread, resulting in a weighted average all in rate of 1.06% at May 31, 2008. During fiscal 2007, another of our Japanese subsidiaries entered into a &yen;3.0 billion (approximately $28.5 million as of May 31, 2008) loan facility that replaced certain intercompany borrowings. The interest rate on the facility is based on the six month Japanese Yen London Interbank Offer Rate (JPY LIBOR) plus a spread resulting in an all in rate of approximately 1.12% at May 31, 2008. This loan facility was renewed during fiscal 2008. Subsequent to May 31, 2008, this loan facility expired and was replaced with intercompany borrowings. During fiscal 2007, the same Japanese subsidiary entered into a &yen;5.0 billion (approximately $47.4 million as of May 31, 2008) term loan that replaced certain intercompany borrowings and matures on February 14, 2012. The interest rate on the loan is approximately 1.5% and interest is paid semi annually. As of May 31, 2008, we had no amounts outstanding under our multi year, $1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks. The facility matures in December 2012 and can be extended for one additional year on its next anniversary date. Based on our current long term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.15%. The facility fee is 0.05% of the total commitment. If our long term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the 36 Table of Contents event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2008, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program, under which there was no amount outstanding at May 31, 2008 or May 31, 2007. We currently have short term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively. We currently believe that cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on June 1, 2007. See Note 8 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43 (EITF 06 2). EITF 06 2 clarifies recognition guidance on the accrual of employees rights to compensated absences under a sabbatical or other similar benefit arrangement. The adoption of EITF 06 2 on June 1, 2007 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of FAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities are effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008 and the provisions of FAS 157 for non financial assets and liabilities except for items recognized at fair value on a recurring basis are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions for non financial assets and liabilities. We have evaluated the provisions of FAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (FAS 159). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The provisions of FAS 159 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008. We have evaluated the provisions of FAS 159 and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141(R)) and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (FAS 160). These standards aim to improve, simplify, and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The provisions of FAS 141(R) and FAS 160 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of FAS 141(R) and FAS 160. 37 Table of Contents In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 161). FAS 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The provisions of FAS 161 are effective for the quarter ending February 28, 2009. We do not expect that the adoption of FAS 161 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. 38 Table of Contents Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and is depreciated over its estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result 39 Table of Contents in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property, plant and equipment may be impaired, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value. Any impairment charges are recorded within other (expense) income, net. We estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance. Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, and changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142), goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. As required by FAS 142, in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value, we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value. Our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset tests require the use of discounted cash flow valuation models. Those models require estimates of future revenue, profits, expenditures and working capital. These estimates are determined by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans and industry data. Our estimates may change in future periods due to, among other things, technological change, economic conditions, changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans. Such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods. Any impairment charge related to goodwill would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and any impairment charge related to other indefinite lived intangible assets would be classified within other (expense) income, net. Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. In these cases, we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value. Any significant impairment charges would be classified within other (expense) income, net. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions, as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance. When specific criteria required by SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted (FAS 133), have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions changes beyond the threshold allowed by FAS 133, we are 40 Table of Contents required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other (expense) income, net during the quarter in which such changes occur. Once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction. We use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When appropriately designated as a hedge in accordance with FAS 133, the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. In accordance with FAS 133, we consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred. Stock based Compensation As of the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we account for stock based compensation in accordance with FAS 123R. Under the provisions of FAS 123R, the fair value of stock based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods, stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists 41 Table of Contents that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year to date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate. We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FIN 48. On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (expense) income, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party and intercompany transactions. We also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. 42 Table of Contents When we begin hedging exposures, the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve to eighteen months, although at May 31, 2008 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 34 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by one of our European subsidiaries. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros, British pounds, and Japanese yen. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive fixed, pay variable interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value at Risk (VaR). Our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments, as defined by the SEC, are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only, and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $34.9 million and $13.7 million at May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007, respectively. The increase in VaR as of May 31, 2008 occurred due to a higher notional value of outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments coupled with increased foreign currency volatility as of May 31, 2008 compared to May 31, 2007. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $32.3 million and $36.5 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. 43 Table of Contents Details of other market sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the VaR calculation above are provided in the table below. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of May 31, 2008.

Intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts with third parties, as discussed above. The fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries. Accordingly, the monthly re measurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary. 44 Table of Contents In fiscal 2003 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a Japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our Japanese subsidiaries. The Japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on 3 month LIBOR plus a spread. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at 0.80% and receives variable interest payments based on 3 month LIBOR plus a spread based on a notional amount of 8.0 billion Japanese yen. This interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period. The change in fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended May 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.
