Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview NIKE designs, develops and markets high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts, NIKE owned retail, including stores and e commerce, independent distributors, franchisees and licensees worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long term revenue growth by creating innovative, must have products; building deep personal consumer connections with our brands; and delivering compelling retail presentation and experiences. We strive to convert revenue growth to shareholder value by driving operating excellence in several key areas: Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, through operational discipline Reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing and product design that strives to eliminate waste Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of brands to eliminate duplicative costs Improving working capital efficiency Deploying capital effectively to create value for our shareholders Through execution of this strategy, our long term financial goal is to achieve: High single digit revenue growth Mid teens earnings per share growth Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses 22 Table of Contents Since the adoption of this long term strategy in 2001, on an annual compounded basis, NIKE, Inc.s revenues and earnings per share have grown 9% and 14%, respectively. During the same period, our return on invested capital increased from 14% to 18%. In fiscal 2009, deteriorating macroeconomic conditions caused significant volatility in global financial markets and put significant pressure on discretionary consumer spending worldwide. NIKEs fiscal 2009 revenues grew 3% to $19.2 billion, net income decreased 21% to $1.5 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $3.03, a 19% decrease versus fiscal 2008. Our fiscal 2009 reported results also contain significant non comparable transactions, including after tax charges of $144.5 million for our restructuring activities, which were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and $240.7 million for the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro, which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Our fiscal 2008 reported results include combined gains from the sale of our Starter Brand and NIKE Bauer Hockey businesses of $35.4 million, net of tax, and a one time tax benefit of $105.4 million. Excluding these non comparable items, net income would have increased 7% to $1.9 billion and diluted earnings per share would have increased 10% to $3.81 compared to fiscal 2008 (see Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding Non Comparable items below). The increase in our net income excluding non comparable items was higher than our rate of revenue growth in fiscal 2009 due primarily to an increase in other (income) expense, net, which included foreign currency conversion gains of $43.4 million compared to foreign currency conversion losses of $76.6 million in fiscal 2008, and the recognition of licensing income of $24.0 million related to our fiscal 2008 sale of the NIKE Bauer Hockey business. Excluding non comparable items, our earnings per share for the year grew at a higher rate than net income given lower outstanding shares due to repurchases made under our share repurchase program in the first half of fiscal 2009. Our cash flows from operations and return on invested capital both declined as compared to fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2009, we took steps we believe prudent and necessary to identify and manage potential exposures and to position ourselves for sustainable, profitable long term growth. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we executed a plan of restructuring the organization to streamline our management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market, and establish a more scalable cost structure. As a result of these actions, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 5% and incurred pre tax restructuring charges of $195 million, primarily consisting of cash charges related to severance costs. As part of this restructuring plan, we also initiated a reorganization of the NIKE brand business into a new operating model consisting of six geographies. As a result of the reorganization, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, our new organizational structure will consist of the following geographies: North America, Western Europe, Central/Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Other steps taken in fiscal 2009 included reductions in planned selling and administrative expenses, including the implementation of a hiring freeze, reductions in planned spending for travel, meetings and demand creation, as well as tighter inventory purchasing and working capital management. We also placed increased focus on monitoring the financial health of suppliers and customers and continued to take proactive measures to consolidate production with our strongest, most efficient and innovative manufacturing contractors to ensure we maintain a healthy production base for the present and the future. These capacity consolidation actions could result in additional costs associated with production and logistics as well as supply chain disruptions in the first half of fiscal year 2010 as we transition production between manufacturing contractors; however, we do not believe these potential additional costs will have a material impact on our operating results. We continue to believe that the Company is well positioned from a business and financial perspective, but we are not immune to the current challenging global economic conditions. These conditions could continue to affect our business in a number of direct and indirect ways, including lower revenue from slowing consumer/customer demand for our products, reduced profit margins and or increased costs, changes in interest and currency exchange rates, lack of credit availability and business disruptions due to difficulties experiences by suppliers and customers. Our future performance is subject to the inherent uncertainty presented by the evolving macroeconomic conditions and our continued actions to respond to these conditions. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions, except per share data) Revenues $ 19,176.1 $ 18,627.0 3 % $ 16,325.9 14 % Cost of sales 10,571.7 10,239.6 3 % 9,165.4 12 % Gross margin 8,604.4 8,387.4 3 % 7,160.5 17 % Gross margin % 44.9 % 45.0 % 43.9 % Selling and administrative expense 6,149.6 5,953.7 3 % 5,028.7 18 % % of Revenues 32.1 % 32.0 % 30.8 % Restructuring charges 195.0 Goodwill impairment 199.3 Intangible and other asset impairment 202.0 Income before income taxes 1,956.5 2,502.9 22 % 2,199.9 14 % Net income 1,486.7 1,883.4 21 % 1,491.5 26 % Diluted earnings per share 3.03 3.74 19 % 2.93 28 % Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding Non Comparable Items(1) Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08Change (In millions, except per share data) Net income, as reported $ 1,486.7 $ 1,883.4 21 % Add: Restructuring charges, net of tax(2) 144.5 Umbro impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets, net of tax(3) 240.7 Gain recognized on sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey, net of tax (17.7 ) Gain recognized on sale of Starter Business, net of tax (17.7 ) One time tax benefits(4) (105.4 ) Net income, excluding non comparable items $ 1,871.9 $ 1,742.6 7 % Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 3.03 $ 3.74 19 % Add: Restructuring charges, net of tax(2) 0.29 Umbro impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets, net of tax(3) 0.49 Gain recognized on sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey,net of tax (0.04 ) Gain recognized on sale of Starter Business, net of tax (0.04 ) One time tax benefits(4) (0.21 ) Diluted earnings per share, excluding non comparable items $ 3.81 $ 3.45 10 % Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 490.7 504.1 ( 1) This schedule is intended to satisfy the quantitative reconciliation for non GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S K of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, this schedule is provided to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding these non comparable items for the years ended May 31, 2009 and 2008. 24 Table of Contents ( 2) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we took necessary steps to streamline our management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market, and establish a more scalable, long term cost structure. As a result, we incurred a $195 million pre tax restructuring charge primarily consisting of severance costs related to the workforce reduction. ( 3) We recorded a non cash impairment charge during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 to reduce the carrying value of Umbros goodwill, indefinite lived trademark and other assets. The impairment charge is a result of both the deteriorating global consumer markets, particularly in Umbros primary market, the United Kingdom, and managements decision to adjust planned investment in the brand. In addition, the deterioration of the financial markets has reduced both the present value of future cash flows and the market value of comparable businesses. ( 4) The tax benefit realized during fiscal 2008 relates to steps taken to realize losses generated by several international entities for which we had not previously recognized the offsetting tax benefit because the realization of those benefits had been uncertain. The necessary steps to realize those tax benefits were taken during fiscal 2008 resulting in a one time reduction of the effective tax rate. Consolidated Operating Results Revenues Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Revenues $ 19,176.1 $ 18,627.0 3 % $ 16,325.9 14 % Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 During fiscal 2009, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenues by 1 percentage point. The U.S. Region contributed nearly 1 percentage point of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2009. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, our international regions contributed over 3 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2009, as all of our international regions posted higher revenues on a currency neutral basis. By product group, our worldwide NIKE brand footwear business reported revenue growth of 6% and contributed $575 million of incremental revenue for fiscal 2009. Worldwide NIKE branded apparel revenues were in line with the prior year, while equipment revenues declined 2% or $20 million. Our Other businesses, comprised primarily of results from Cole Haan, Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE Golf, and Umbro in fiscal 2009, constituted the remaining revenue. In fiscal 2008, our Other businesses also included Exeter Brands Group (whose primary business was the Starter brand business which was sold on December 17, 2007) and NIKE Bauer Hockey (which was sold on April 17, 2008). Umbro was acquired on March 3, 2008. Revenues for these businesses declined 1% or $17 million. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 During fiscal 2008, changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed 5 percentage points of consolidated revenue growth. Strong demand for NIKE brand products continued to drive revenue growth, as all four of our geographic regions and, on a consolidated basis, all three of our product business units delivered revenue growth. The U.S. Region contributed nearly 2 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2008. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, our international regions contributed nearly 7 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2008, as all of our international regions posted higher revenues. Our Other businesses contributed the remaining consolidated constant currency revenue growth, as Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and NIKE Golf posted higher year over year revenues. 25 Table of Contents By product group, worldwide NIKE brand footwear revenue grew 14% and contributed more than $1.2 billion of incremental revenue for fiscal 2008. Worldwide NIKE branded apparel and equipment businesses reported revenue growth of 14% and 6% for the year, respectively, and combined added approximately $750 million of incremental revenue in fiscal 2008. Our Other businesses reported revenue growth of 17% and combined added more than $360 million of incremental revenue. Gross Margin Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Gross Margin $ 8,604.4 $ 8,387.4 3% $ 7,160.5 17% Gross Margin % 44.9 % 45.0 % (10 bps ) 43.9 % 110 bps Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 During fiscal 2009, the primary factors contributing to the 10 basis point decline in consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year were lower gross pricing margins and increased discounts which, when combined, decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 60 basis points. This decrease was partially offset by improved hedge rates relative to the prior year, primarily in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Region. Gross pricing margins were lower, primarily driven by higher product input costs, most notably for footwear products. Higher levels of discounts were provided across all businesses in fiscal 2009 to manage inventory levels. We anticipate our gross margins in fiscal 2010 will be negatively impacted by hedge rates that are unfavorable in comparison to the prior year. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 During fiscal 2008, the primary factors contributing to the 110 basis point increase in the consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year included: higher footwear in line gross pricing margins, most notably in the U.S. Region, primarily due to strategic price increases; improved currency hedge rates relative to the prior year, primarily in the EMEA Region; and higher footwear close out net pricing margins, most notably in the EMEA Region, primarily due to better inventory management. The factors driving an increased gross margin percentage were partially offset by lower apparel in line gross pricing margins primarily driven by higher product costs, most notably in the U.S. and EMEA regions, and increased apparel close out sales, primarily in the U.S. Region. Selling and Administrative Expense Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Operating overhead expense $ 3,798.2 $ 3,645.4 4% $ 3,116.3 17% Demand creation expense(1) 2,351.4 2,308.3 2% 1,912.4 21% Selling and administrative expense $ 6,149.6 $ 5,953.7 3% $ 5,028.7 18% % of Revenues 32.1 % 32.0% 10 bps 30.8 % 120 bps (1) Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. 26 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased selling and administrative expense by 2 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Excluding changes in exchange rates, operating overhead increased 6% during fiscal 2009. The increase in operating overhead in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to investments in growth drivers such as NIKE owned retail in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, infrastructure for emerging markets in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions and non NIKE brand businesses, which more than offset the steps taken to reduce operating overhead spending including implementation of a hiring freeze and reductions in spending for travel and meetings. On a constant currency basis, demand creation expense increased 3% during fiscal 2009. Demand creation spending decreased in the second half of fiscal 2009 as a result of actions taken to reduce spending across nearly all demand creation related activities, most notably traditional media and print advertising. The increase in demand creation the first half of fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to strategic investments in demand creation, including first quarter spending around the Beijing Summer Olympics and the European Football Championships, and increased investments in athlete and team endorsements across all regions. In fiscal 2010, we intend to reduce selling and administrative spending while shifting resources to fund initiatives that are critical to the achievement of our long term growth goals. We expect our selling and administrative expenses to decline in the first half of fiscal 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting both lower operating overhead and demand creation spending, with the latter driven partially by the comparison to the significant prior year demand creation investment around the Beijing Summer Olympics and European Football Championships. Future selling and administrative expense may vary from our current expectations due to changes in the rapidly evolving macroeconomic environment and our reaction to those changes. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In fiscal 2008, selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues by 120 basis points, driven primarily by strategic investments in both demand creation and operating overhead. Changes in currency exchange rates increased selling and administrative expense growth by 4 percentage points. On a constant currency basis, demand creation expense increased 15% versus the prior year. The year over year increase was primarily attributable to investments in athlete and sport team endorsers of our products, spending around major sporting events including the European Football Championships and the Beijing Summer Olympics, key product initiatives such as Mens Training in the U.S. and retail presentation. Excluding the effects of changes in exchange rates, operating overhead increased 14% versus the prior year. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in growth drivers such as NIKE owned retail, non NIKE brand businesses, emerging markets and normal wage inflation and performance based compensation. Restructuring Charges During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we executed a plan to restructure the organization to streamline our management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure. As a result of these actions, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 5% and incurred pre tax restructuring charges of $195 million, primarily consisting of cash charges related to severance costs. These charges are included in our Corporate category for segment reporting purposes. Goodwill, Intangible and Other Asset Impairment In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we recognized a $401.3 million pre tax non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Umbros goodwill, intangible and other assets. Although Umbros financial 27 Table of Contents performance for fiscal 2009 was slightly better than we had originally expected, projected future cash flows had fallen below the levels we expected at the time of acquisition. This erosion is a result of both the unprecedented decline in global consumer markets, particularly in the United Kingdom, and our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business. We measured the fair value of Umbro by using an equal weighting of the fair value implied by a discounted cash flow analysis and by comparisons with the market values of similar publicly traded companies. We believe the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis, and this combination is indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation. The fair value of Umbros indefinite lived trademark was estimated using the relief from royalty method, which assumes that the trademark has value to the extent that Umbro is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the trademark. Our assessments have resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of $199.3 million and $181.3 million related to Umbros goodwill and trademark, respectively, in fiscal 2009. In addition to the impairment analysis, we determined an equity investment held by Umbro was impaired, and recognized a charge of $20.7 million related to the impairment of this investment. These charges are included in our Other category for segment reporting purposes. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4 Acquisition, Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Other (Income) Expense, net Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For fiscal 2009, other (income) expense, net was a gain of $88.5 million compared to a loss of $7.9 million in fiscal 2008. Other (income) expense, net is primarily comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non functional currencies and results of foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as disposals of fixed assets and other unusual or non recurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business. For fiscal 2009, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of $43.4 million of foreign currency conversion gains and the recognition of $24.0 million of licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of the NIKE Bauer Hockey business. For fiscal 2008, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of a $32.0 million gain on the sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey and a $28.6 million gain on the sale of the Starter brand business, as well as foreign currency conversion losses of $76.6 million. Foreign currency conversion gains and losses reported in other (income) expense, net, with the exception of gains and losses generated by the EMEA Region and Other businesses, are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment presentation of pre tax income in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (Note 19 Operating Segments and Related Information). For fiscal 2009, we estimate that the combination of foreign currency conversion gains in other (income) expense, net and the modestly favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits from our international businesses resulted in a year over year increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately $124 million. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 For fiscal 2008, other (income) expense, net was a loss of $7.9 million compared to a gain of $0.9 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, other (income) expense, net included foreign currency conversion losses that were partially offset by the $32.0 million gain on the sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey and the $28.6 million gain on the sale of the Starter brand business. Other (income) expense, net in fiscal 2007 is primarily comprised of the $14.7 million gain on the sale leaseback of our Oregon footwear distribution center and the $14.2 million benefit from the settlement of the Converse arbitration, partially offset by foreign currency conversion losses. 28 Table of Contents In fiscal 2008, we estimate that the combination of favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits from international businesses and the foreign currency conversion losses included in other (income) expense, net resulted in a year over year increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately $122 million. Income Taxes Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change Effective tax rate 24.0 % 24.8 % (80 ) bps 32.2 % (740 ) bps Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 80 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 due primarily to the tax benefit related to the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro that had a favorable impact of 250 basis points. Profits earned outside of the U.S., the impact of the resolution of foreign audit items and the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit also favorably impacted our fiscal 2009 effective tax rate. Reflected in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was a one time tax benefit of $105.4 million, which had a favorable impact of 420 basis points on our effective tax rate. We estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2010 will be approximately 25.5%. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 24.8%, 740 basis points lower than the prior year. Over the last few years, several of our international entities generated losses for which we did not recognize the corresponding tax benefits, as the realization of those benefits was uncertain. In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we took steps necessary to realize these benefits, resulting in a one time tax benefit of $105.4 million. Also reflected in the year over year effective tax rate improvement was a reduction in our on going effective tax rate resulting from our profits earned outside the United States; our effective tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Futures Orders Worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2009 declined 12% compared to orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2009. This futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. The net effect from changes in currency exchange rates contributed approximately 7 percentage points to this reported futures decline versus the same period in the prior year. Excluding this currency impact, lower apparel orders drove most of the decline in overall futures and advance orders. The reported futures and advance orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at once orders and that the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the scheduled noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders, and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at once and close out sales of NIKE footwear and apparel, wholesale sales of equipment, Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, Umbro, NIKE Golf and retail sales across all brands. 29 Table of Contents Operating Segments The breakdown of revenues follows: Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008(1) FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007(1) FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) U.S. Region $ 6,542.9 $ 6,414.5 2 % $ 6,131.7 5 % EMEA Region 5,512.2 5,629.2 2 % 4,764.1 18 % Asia Pacific Region 3,322.0 2,887.6 15 % 2,295.7 26 % Americas Region 1,284.7 1,164.7 10 % 966.7 20 % Total NIKE Brand Revenues 16,661.8 16,096.0 4 % 14,158.2 14 % Other 2,514.3 2,531.0 1 % 2,167.7 17 % Total NIKE, Inc.

U.S. Region Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 4,550.8 $ 4,326.8 5 % $ 4,067.2 6 % Apparel 1,664.4 1,745.1 5 % 1,716.1 2 % Equipment 327.7 342.6 4 % 348.4 2 % Total Revenues $ 6,542.9 $ 6,414.5 2 % $ 6,131.7 5 % Pre tax Income $ 1,337.9 $ 1,402.0 5 % $ 1,386.1 1 % 30 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 During fiscal 2009, the increase in U.S. footwear revenue was the result of low single digit growth in both unit sales and average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was primarily driven by higher demand for our Jordan brand, action sports and kids products. The increase in average selling price per pair was attributable to selective price increases, primarily during the first half of fiscal 2009, and increased sales mix of higher priced Jordan brand products, partially offset by increased sales mix of kids products which are lower priced. The year over year decrease in U.S. apparel revenues during fiscal 2009 reflected a mid single digit decrease in unit sales, primarily driven by a reduction in products sold to value channel retailers and generally softer demand in the overall apparel market. Average selling prices increased slightly as a result of the reduction in products sold to value retailers, mostly offset by an increased mix of close out sales and higher levels of discounts provided retailers to manage inventory levels. Pre tax income for the U.S. Region declined in fiscal 2009 as a result of higher operating overhead expenses and lower gross margins. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in NIKE owned retail. Gross margins decreased as a result of higher warehousing costs, higher retail inventory markdowns and increased customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 During fiscal 2008, the increase in U.S. footwear revenue was the result of low single digit growth in unit sales and a slight increase in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales and average selling price per pair was driven by higher demand for our NIKE brand sportswear products and Jordan brand products, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our NIKE brand basketball products. The increase in average selling price per pair was also attributable to strategic price increases and an increased sales mix of higher priced NIKE brand sportswear and Jordan brand products. The year over year increase in U.S. apparel revenues during fiscal 2008 reflected an increase in unit sales, mostly offset by lower average selling prices. The increase in unit sales was primarily driven by higher close out sales and increased demand for NIKE brand sports performance products, partially offset by lower unit sales of sportswear and Jordan brand products. Average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of a higher mix of close out sales. The year over year decrease in U.S. equipment revenues during fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of lower unit sales of accessory products and fewer close out sales. Pre tax income for the U.S. Region grew at a slower rate than revenue in fiscal 2008 as a result of higher demand creation and operating overhead expenses, partially offset by higher gross margins, driven by footwear. The increase in demand creation was driven by higher sports marketing expenses and investments in the retail presentation of our key wholesale customers. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in NIKE owned retail and normal wage inflation. 31 Table of Contents EMEA Region Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 3,136.7 $ 3,112.6 1 % $ 2,608.0 19 % Apparel 1,970.2 2,083.5 5 % 1,757.2 19 % Equipment 405.3 433.1 6 % 398.9 9 % Total Revenues $ 5,512.2 $ 5,629.2 2 % $ 4,764.1 18 % Pre tax Income $ 1,316.9 $ 1,281.9 3 % $ 1,050.1 22 % Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For the EMEA Region, changes in currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, a number of markets within the region experienced lower revenues, reflecting a more difficult retail environment in these markets. The U.K. remained flat for fiscal 2009 while the emerging markets in the region grew 14%, driven by stronger results in Russia during the first half of fiscal 2009. These results were offset by lower revenues in Southern European markets, including Spain, Italy and France. Excluding changes in exchange rates, footwear revenues increased 4 percentage points during fiscal 2009. The increase in footwear revenue was attributable to mid single digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a low single digit decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for NIKE brand sportswear and kids products. The decrease in average selling price per pair was mainly attributable to higher customer discounts and a shift in product mix to lower priced product models, most notably higher volume of kids products. On a currency neutral basis, EMEA apparel revenue decreased 4 percentage points during fiscal 2009, primarily driven by lower average selling prices resulting from a higher mix of close out sales and higher levels of discounts provided retailers to manage inventory levels, which more than offset a mid single digit increase in unit sales. The year over year increase in pre tax income for the EMEA Region during fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage, partially offset by slightly higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to improved year over year currency hedge rates which more than offset higher warehousing costs and discounts on in line products. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was mainly driven by retail expansion across the region. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 For the EMEA Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 11 percentage points of the revenue growth during fiscal 2008. Nearly all markets within the region increased revenues during the year. The emerging markets in the region grew nearly 25%, driven by strong results in Russia, Turkey and South Africa. Increases in Northern Europe and the U.K. also contributed significantly to the revenue growth. Excluding changes in exchange rates, footwear revenues increased 8 percentage points during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year. The increase in footwear revenue was attributable to double digit growth in unit sales, partially offset by a low single digit decrease in the average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for our NIKE brand soccer and sportswear products. The decrease in 32 Table of Contents average selling price per pair resulted from a shift in product mix from higher priced to lower priced product models, most notably within our NIKE brand sportswear product lines. On a currency neutral basis, EMEA apparel revenue increased 8 percentage points during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of increased unit sales and a slight increase in average selling prices. The increase in unit sales was driven primarily by increased demand for sports performance products, most notably soccer. The increase in pre tax income for the EMEA Region during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the increase in revenues, favorable foreign currency translation and a higher gross margin percentage, partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to improved year over year hedge rates and improved margins on close out product. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was driven by an increase in demand creation spending, primarily attributable to spending around the European Football Championships. As a result of retail expansion and overall business growth across the region, operating overhead expenses increased for the year, but at a slower rate than revenue growth. Asia Pacific Region Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 1,727.1 $ 1,499.5 15 % $ 1,159.2 29 % Apparel 1,322.3 1,140.0 16 % 909.3 25 % Equipment 272.6 248.1 10 % 227.2 9 % Total Revenues $ 3,322.0 $ 2,887.6 15 % $ 2,295.7 26 % Pre tax Income $ 853.4 $ 694.2 23 % $ 515.4 35 % Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 3 percentage points of revenue growth for fiscal 2009. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, all countries across the region delivered revenue growth. China continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region as fiscal 2009 revenues increased 22% on a currency neutral basis, driven by expansion in both the number of stores selling NIKE products and sales through existing stores. Chinas rate of revenue growth slowed to 6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as we lapped very strong growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. On a currency neutral basis, revenues in Japan were up 1% compared to fiscal 2008. Footwear and apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2009 were driven primarily by an increase in unit sales, most notably in China. The growth in unit sales was slightly offset by a low single digit reduction in average selling prices in fiscal 2009 resulting primarily from increased discounts on in line products provided retailers to manage inventory levels. The increase in pre tax income for the Asia Pacific Region for fiscal 2009 was driven by higher revenues and improved gross margins, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expenses. Gross margins improved versus the prior year, primarily driven by improved year over year standard foreign currency rates and reduced warehousing costs, which more than offset increased product discounts. Selling and administrative expenses increased, but represented a lower percentage of revenues in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008. The increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to retail and infrastructure expansion, primarily in China, and spending around brand events. 33 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In the Asia Pacific Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 6 percentage points of revenue growth for fiscal 2008. Nearly all countries across the region delivered revenue growth on a currency neutral basis. China continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region as fiscal 2008 revenues increased 50% on a currency neutral basis, driven by the expansion in both the number of stores selling NIKE products and sales through existing stores. Constant currency revenues in Japan increased 2% during fiscal 2008. Footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2008 reflected increased unit sales, most notably in China, partially offset by lower average selling prices driven primarily by a shift in mix from higher priced to lower priced models. The year over year increase in apparel revenue was driven by increased demand in China. The increase in pre tax income for the Asia Pacific Region for fiscal 2008 was driven by higher revenues, improved gross margins and favorable foreign currency translation, which more than offset slightly higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. The gross margin improvement versus the prior year was primarily driven by reduced warehousing costs, improved year over year standard currency rates and improved margins on close out product. The increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to spending around the Beijing Summer Olympics. Overall business growth across the region combined with retail expansion, primarily in China, also contributed to an increase in operating overhead expenses, which grew slightly slower than revenues. Americas Region Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 892.1 $ 792.7 13 % $ 679.6 17 % Apparel 287.8 265.4 8 % 193.9 37 % Equipment 104.8 106.6 2 % 93.2 14 % Total Revenues $ 1,284.7 $ 1,164.7 10 % $ 966.7 20 % Pre tax Income $ 274.1 $ 242.3 13 % $ 199.3 22 % Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 In the Americas Region, changes in currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 9 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Americas Region reported growth in all markets, led by Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. The increase in pre tax income for fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to higher revenues and selling and administrative expense leverage, which more than offset lower gross margins. Selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2008, but represented a lower percentage of revenues for fiscal 2009. The increase in selling and administrative expense was due to increases in both demand creation and operating overhead expenses mainly driven by spending around retail marketing programs, brand events and normal wage inflation. The slight decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2009 was mainly due to a higher sales mix of lower margin footwear products and higher import costs, which more than offset improved year on year standard foreign currency rates. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In the Americas Region, changes in currency exchange rates contributed 7 percentage points of revenue growth for fiscal 2008. Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Americas Region reported growth in all markets, led by Argentina, Mexico and Brazil. 34 Table of Contents The increase in pre tax income for fiscal 2008 versus the prior year was primarily attributable to higher revenues, improved gross margins and operating overhead leverage, combined with favorable foreign currency translation. These factors were partially offset by higher demand creation spending as a percentage of revenue. The gross margin improvement was driven primarily by higher in line net pricing margins resulting from a better mix of products sold and fewer discounts offered in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The increase in demand creation spending during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to investments in sports marketing, most notably in soccer, brand events and investments in our retail presentation. Other Businesses Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Revenues Converse $ 915.3 $ 729.0 26 % $ 563.8 29 % NIKE Golf 648.3 725.2 11 % 646.3 12 % Cole Haan 471.6 496.2 5 % 468.6 6 % Hurley 202.9 171.1 19 % 150.6 14 % Umbro 174.0 53.9 223 % Bauer 201.9 100 % 166.1 22 % Exeter 35.1 100 % 67.7 48 % Other 102.2 118.6 14 % 104.6 13 % Revenues $ 2,514.3 $ 2,531.0 1 % $ 2,167.7 17 % Pre tax Income $ (196.7 ) $ 364.9 154 % $ 299.7 22 % Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For fiscal 2009, our Other businesses were primarily comprised of Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, NIKE Golf and Umbro. For fiscal 2008, our Other businesses were primarily comprised of Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter (whose primary business was the Starter brand business which was sold on December 17, 2007), Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey (which was sold on April 17, 2008), NIKE Golf and Umbro (which was acquired on March 3, 2008). The slight decrease in Other businesses revenues for fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to the loss of revenue from NIKE Bauer Hockey and the Starter brand business. Excluding the loss of revenue from NIKE Bauer Hockey and the Starter brand business and the addition of Umbro, Other businesses revenues for fiscal 2009 would have increased 5%, driven by the strong performance from Converse and Hurley, offset by sales decreases at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan, due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets. Pre tax income for Other businesses declined for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of a $401.3 million pre tax non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Umbros goodwill, intangible and other assets. Excluding the impairment charge, the loss of income from NIKE Bauer Hockey and the Starter brand business along with the dilutive impact of Umbro, pre tax income for Other businesses would have decreased by 28%, driven by declines in operating results at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4 Acquisition, Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 35 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 The increase in Other business revenues was driven by higher revenues across most businesses, most notably Converse and NIKE Golf. The increase in Converse and NIKE Golf is mainly driven by strong consumer demand both in the United States and international markets. The growth at Cole Haan is mainly driven by the strong results at Company owned retail stores. During fiscal 2008, growth at Converse and NIKE Golf, combined with margin improvements across most businesses drove the year over year increase in pre tax income. Fiscal 2007 pre tax income included a $14.2 million benefit relating to the settlement of an arbitration ruling involving Converse and a former South American licensee. Fiscal 2008 pre tax income for our Other businesses would have increased approximately 18% versus fiscal 2007 excluding this favorable settlement. On March 3, 2008, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Umbro, a United Kingdom based global soccer brand, for a purchase price of &pound;290.5 million in cash (approximately $576.4 million), inclusive of direct transaction costs. This acquisition was intended to strengthen our market position in the United Kingdom and expand NIKEs global leadership in soccer, a key area of growth for the Company. This acquisition also provides positions in emerging soccer markets such as China, Russia and Brazil. The results of Umbros operations have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and in the Other operating segment since the date of acquisition. Umbro, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange prior to our acquisition, reported in their 2006 annual report that revenues for calendar year 2006 were approximately $276 million (&pound;149.5 million), and estimated that the combination of Umbros calendar year 2006 wholesale revenue and estimated sales revenue earned by Umbros licensees from the sale of Umbro products totaled approximately $755 million (&pound;409.4 million). Following a strategic review of the Companys existing business portfolio, we concluded that the Starter and NIKE Bauer Hockey businesses did not align with our long term growth priorities. On December 17, 2007 we completed the sale of the Starter brand business for $60 million in cash. On April 17, 2008, we completed the sale of the NIKE Bauer Hockey business for net proceeds of $189.2 million after working capital adjustments. These transactions resulted in gains of approximately $28.6 million and $32.0 million, respectively, which are reflected in the Corporate line in our segment presentation of pre tax income in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (Note 19 Operating Segments and Related Information). Corporate Expense Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change Fiscal 2007 FY08 vs.FY07% Change (In millions) Corporate Expense $ (1,629.1 ) $ (1,482.4 ) 10 % $ (1,250.7 ) 19 % Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Corporate expense consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, which includes expenses associated with centrally managed departments, depreciation and amortization related to the Companys corporate headquarters, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, foreign currency gains and losses, including hedge gains and losses, corporate eliminations and other items. The increase in corporate expense in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to pre tax restructuring charges of $195 million, consisting primarily of cash charges related to severance costs. 36 Table of Contents Foreign currency gains and losses include conversion gains and losses generated by our centrally managed foreign currency hedging program and other conversion gains and losses. Foreign currency gains and losses also include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to our regions. With the exception of foreign currency gains and losses generated by the EMEA Region and Other businesses, which are reported within their respective operating results, substantially all of the Companys remaining conversion gains and losses as well as standard to actual foreign currency gains and losses reside at Corporate. In fiscal 2009, foreign currency conversion gains (losses) reported in Corporate expense totaled $45.9 million compared to ($76.3) million in fiscal 2008, which was primarily driven by a net gain from currency hedges in fiscal 2009 versus a net hedge loss in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 The increase in corporate expense from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily driven by increased employee compensation expense due to the increase in centralized corporate functions, higher performance based compensation as well as increased investments in demand creation, including other spending around the Beijing Summer Olympics. In fiscal 2008, foreign currency conversion loss reported in Corporate expense totaled $76.3 million compared to $31.7 million in fiscal 2007, which was primarily driven by a larger net loss from currency hedges in fiscal 2008 versus 2007. Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices Overview As a global company with significant operations outside the U.S., in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Foreign currency fluctuations affect the recording of transactions, such as sales, purchases and intercompany transactions denominated in non functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. Our primary foreign currency exposures are related to U.S. dollar transactions at wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, as well as transactions and translation of results denominated in the Euro, British pound, Chinese renminbi and Japanese yen. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. This also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements, dependent upon hedge horizons. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis, to manage those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. on a consolidated basis. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio, and by hedging remaining material exposures, where practical, using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. The Companys hedging policies are designed to partially or entirely offset changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as issued and amended (FAS 133). We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Transactional exposures We transact business in various currencies and have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary, which subjects us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: 1. Inventory Purchases Most of our inventory purchases around the world are denominated in U.S. dollars. This generates foreign currency exposures for all subsidiaries with a functional currency other 37 Table of Contents than the U.S. dollar. A weaker U.S. dollar reduces the inventory cost in the purchasing subsidiarys functional currency whereas a stronger U.S. dollar increases the inventory cost. 2. Non Functional Currency Revenues A portion of our EMEA Region revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British pound), but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency, generating foreign currency exposures. 3. Other Revenues and Costs Non functional currency revenues and costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other payments, generate foreign currency risk to a lesser extent. 4. Non functional currency asset and liabilities Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement under SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, (FAS 52), which may create fluctuations in other (income) expense within our consolidated results of operations. Managing transactional exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We use currency forward contracts and options with maturities up to 23 months to hedge the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including non functional currency revenues and expenses. These are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with FAS 133. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2009 and 2008 was $248.0 million and $95.3 million in assets and $12.2 million and $149.8 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of shareholders equity, and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion, which was not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage foreign exchange exposure of non functional currency assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not designated as hedges under FAS 133. In these cases, the change in value of the instruments is intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related asset or liability. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2009 and 2008, was $13.2 million and $34.2 million in assets and $34.3 million and $7.3 million in liabilities, respectively. The change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in earnings. The impact of such instruments is included in other (income) expense, net and aims to offset foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses of the exposures being hedged. Refer to Note 18 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative detail. Translational exposures Substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets and operational results of these foreign currency denominated subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non U.S. dollar balance sheets into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders equity. In preparing our consolidated statements of income, foreign exchange rate fluctuations impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. In translation, a weaker U.S. dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues and pre tax income was a net translation benefit (detriment) of ($199.4) million and $4.0 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended May 31, 2009. 38 Table of Contents Managing translational exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. dollar denominated available for sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. dollar denominated securities at non U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under FAS 133. We utilize forward contracts and options to partially, or entirely, hedge the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. dollar investments. This has the effect of partially offsetting the year over year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available for sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fair value of instruments used in this manner at May 31, 2009 and 2008 was $103.6 million and $7.8 million in assets and $0 and $14.4 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in other (income) expense, net in the period during which the hedged available for sale investment is sold and affects earnings. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. For fiscal 2009, we estimate that the combination of foreign currency conversion gains in other (income) expense, net and the modestly favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits from our international businesses resulted in a year over year increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately $124 million. Refer to Note 18 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative detail. Net investments in foreign subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. During fiscal 2008, we began to hedge certain net investment positions in Euro functional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on net investments, with the effect of preserving the value of future repatriated earnings. In accordance with FAS 133, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any year presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI; concurrent with settlement, we enter into new forward contracts at the current market rate. The impact of net investment hedges reflected in OCI was a pre tax gain (loss) of $161.4 million and ($68.6) million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled $191.3 million and ($76.0) million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009 compared to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2008. This decrease was mainly due to an increase in cash used for our working capital as a result of lower accounts payable and a higher accounts receivable balance. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to lower purchases of inventory as well as a reduction in overall spending. The higher accounts receivable balance is a result of a longer collection cycle, reflecting a more challenging retail environment experienced by our customers in the EMEA and U.S. regions. 39 Table of Contents Cash used by investing activities was $0.8 billion during fiscal 2009 compared to $0.5 billion in fiscal 2008. The year over year increase was primarily due to a net increase in short term investments purchased in fiscal 2009. The increase in net purchases of short term investments in fiscal 2009 was partially offset by proceeds from settlement of net investment hedges of $191.3 million. During the second half of fiscal 2008, we began to use net investment hedges to mitigate the risk of variability in foreign currency denominated net investments in certain wholly owned international subsidiaries. Cash used in financing activities was $0.7 billion during fiscal 2009, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2008. The decrease in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in share repurchases to preserve liquidity given the current financial market conditions. In fiscal 2009, we purchased approximately 10.6 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for $639.0 million. As of the end of fiscal 2009, we have repurchased 49.2 million shares for $2.7 billion under the $3 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in June 2006. In September 2008, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchase program. The new program will commence upon completion of our current $3 billion share repurchase program. We expect to fund share repurchases from operating cash flow, excess cash, and or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items that fall under the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2009, and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, Description of Commitment 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 330.2 $ 281.3 $ 233.6 $ 195.6 $ 168.6 $ 588.5 $ 1,797.8 Long term Debt 32.0 6.9 167.1 46.9 56.9 144.6 $ 454.4 Endorsement Contracts(1) 711.7 654.6 601.0 509.7 431.0 1,293.9 $ 4,201.9 Product Purchase Obligations(2) 1,985.7 $ 1,985.7 Other(3) 247.1 106.3 67.8 78.0 3.0 2.0 $ 504.2 Total $ 3,306.7 $ 1,049.1 $ 1,069.5 $ 830.2 $ 659.5 $ 2,029.0 $ 8,944.0 (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of 40 Table of Contents product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. (2) We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2009. (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2009. The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $273.9 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2009. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. We also have the following outstanding short term debt obligations as of May 31, 2009. Please refer to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (Note 7 Short Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as ofMay 31, 2009 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ 342.9 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 78.5 As of May 31, 2009, letters of credit of $154.8 million were outstanding, generally for the purchase of inventory. Capital Resources In December 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which $760 million in debt securities may be issued. As of May 31, 2009, no debt securities had been issued under this shelf registration. We may issue debt securities under the shelf registration in fiscal 2010 depending on general corporate needs. As of May 31, 2009, we had no amounts outstanding under our multi year, $1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks. The facility matures in December 2012. Based on our current long term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.15%. The facility fee is 0.05% of the total commitment. If our long term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the 41 Table of Contents event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2009, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. As of May 31, 2009, $100 million was outstanding under this program at a weighted average interest rate of 0.40%. This borrowing was repaid subsequent to May 31, 2009. We may issue commercial paper from time to time during fiscal 2010 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively. Despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Continuing volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. Notwithstanding these adverse market conditions, we believe that current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards On December 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (FAS 161), which provides revised guidance for enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and the related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133, and how derivative instruments and the related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The adoption of FAS 161 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. For additional information, see Note 18 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. On June 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157) for financial assets and liabilities, which clarifies the meaning of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under FAS 157 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the assets or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Subsequent changes in fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income when they occur. The effective date of the provisions of FAS 157 for non financial assets and liabilities, except for items recognized at fair value on a recurring basis, was deferred by FASB Staff Position FAS 157 2 (FSP FAS 157 2) and is effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of FAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. The adoption of FAS 157 for non financial assets and liabilities is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. See Note 6 Fair Value Measurements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Also effective June 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (FAS 159), which allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract by contract basis. As of May 31, 2009, we have not elected the fair value option for any additional financial assets and liabilities beyond those already prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active (FSP FAS 157 3). FSP FAS 157 3 clarifies the application of FAS 157 in a market that is not active and defines additional key criteria in determining the fair value of a 42 Table of Contents financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. FSP FAS 157 3 applies to financial assets within the scope of accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements in accordance with FAS 157. FSP FAS 157 3 was effective upon issuance and the application of FSP FAS 157 3 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, Subsequent Events (FAS 165), which establishes general standards of accounting and disclosure for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. The provisions of FAS 165 are effective for the quarter ending August 31, 2009. We do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In April 2009, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 107 1 and APB 28 1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (FSP FAS 107 1 and APB 28 1), which amends SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, and APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim and annual reporting periods. The provisions of FSP FAS 107 1 and APB 28 1 are effective for the quarter ending August 31, 2009. We do not expect the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141(R)) and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (FAS 160). These standards aim to improve, simplify, and converge international standards of accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The provisions of FAS 141(R) are effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after June 1, 2009. Generally, the effects of FAS 141(R) will depend on future acquisitions. The provisions of FAS No. 160 are effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2009. We do not expect that the adoption of FAS 160 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In April 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142 3). FSP FAS 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The intent of the position is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under FAS 141(R), and other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The provisions of FSP FAS 142 3 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of FSP FAS 142 3 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect 43 Table of Contents working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to 44 Table of Contents cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value. We review the carrying value of long lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. 45 Table of Contents Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142), we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis. Indefinite lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. In measuring the fair value for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief from royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions, as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance. When specific criteria required by SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted (FAS 133), have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions changes beyond the threshold allowed by FAS 133, we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which such changes 46 Table of Contents occur. Once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction. We use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When appropriately designated as a hedge in accordance with FAS 133, the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. In accordance with FAS 133, we consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred. Stock based Compensation As of the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we account for stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123R Share Based Payment (FAS 123R). Under the provisions of FAS 123R, the fair value of stock based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods, stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FAS 109). Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the 47 Table of Contents actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year to date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate. We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (income) expense, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive or negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. This also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain 48 Table of Contents anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party and intercompany transactions. We also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When we begin hedging exposures, the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve to eighteen months, although at May 31, 2009 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 23 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by one of our European subsidiaries. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euro, Japanese yen and British pound. See Section Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices under Item 7 for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive fixed, pay variable interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value at Risk (VaR). Our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only, and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $67.8 million and $34.9 million at May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008, respectively. The VaR increased, despite a reduction in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative instruments, as a result of increased foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2009 as compared to 49 Table of Contents May 31, 2008. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $207.4 million and $32.3 million during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. We, therefore, consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows.

In fiscal 2003, we entered into a receive floating, pay fixed interest rate swap related to a Japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our Japanese subsidiaries. This interest rate swap was not designated as a hedge instrument under FAS 133. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap were recorded to consolidated net income each period. The change in fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended May 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Both the intercompany loan and the related interest rate swap matured during fiscal 2009.
