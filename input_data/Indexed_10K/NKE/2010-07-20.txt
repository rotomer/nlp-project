Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview NIKE designs, develops and markets high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts, NIKE owned retail, including stores and e commerce, independent distributors, franchisees and licensees worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long term revenue growth by creating innovative, must have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling retail presentation and experiences. Aside from achieving long term revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operating excellence in several key areas: Making our supply chain a competitive advantage, through operational discipline, Reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing and product design that strives to eliminate waste, Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of brands to eliminate duplicative costs, Improving working capital efficiency, and Deploying capital effectively to create value for our shareholders. Through execution of this strategy, our long term financial goals continue to be: High single digit revenue growth, Mid teens earnings per share growth, Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. 22 Table of Contents Since the adoption of this long term strategy in 2001, NIKE, Inc.s revenues and earnings per share have grown 8% and 14%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. During the same period, our return on invested capital has increased from 14% to 21%. While macroeconomic conditions in fiscal 2010 continued to remain challenging, putting significant pressure on consumer spending in most markets worldwide, we have continued to focus on achieving appropriate financial performance, while extending our market leadership and positioning ourselves for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. NIKE, Inc.s fiscal 2010 revenues declined 1% to $19.0 billion, net income increased 28% to $1.9 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $3.86, a 27% increase versus fiscal 2009. Our fiscal 2009 reported results contain significant non comparable transactions, including an after tax charge of $145 million for restructuring activities, recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and an after tax charge of $241 million for the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro, which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Excluding these non comparable items, our fiscal 2010 net income would have increased 2% and diluted earnings per share would have increased 1% compared to fiscal 2009 (see Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding Non Comparable items below). The increase in net income excluding non comparable items was primarily driven by an improved gross margin percentage and a reduction in our effective tax rate, which more than offset the reduction in revenues and higher selling and administrative expenses. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily the result of favorable product mix, cost reduction initiatives, lower input costs and sales growth in our NIKE owned retail business. Our year over year effective tax rate improvement was driven by continued benefit from our international businesses, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. The increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily attributable to an increase in performance based compensation as well as investments in our NIKE owned retail business, which more than offset reductions in compensation expense resulting from restructuring activities that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2010, diluted earnings per share grew at a slightly lower rate than net income given higher average outstanding shares. In fiscal 2010, we increased cash flow from operations as a result of working capital reductions, reflecting our efforts to aggressively manage inventory levels and accounts receivable collections. At May 31, 2010, our inventory and accounts receivable balances were down 13% and 8%, respectively, compared to May 31, 2009. During fiscal 2010, we also returned larger amounts of cash to our shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases compared to fiscal 2009. Although most of our businesses reported revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010, the majority returned to growth in the second half of fiscal 2010. Futures orders for NIKE Brand Footwear and Apparel scheduled for delivery during the first six months of fiscal 2011 increased 7% as compared to the same periods in the prior year. While we continue to believe that the Company is well positioned from a business and financial perspective, our future performance is subject to the inherent uncertainty presented by volatile macroeconomic conditions that may have an impact on our operations around the world. These conditions could continue to affect our business in a number of direct and indirect ways, including lower revenue from slowing consumer/customer demand for our products, reduced profit margins and or increased costs, changes in interest and currency exchange rates, lack of credit availability and business disruptions due to difficulties experienced by suppliers and customers. Our future performance is subject to our continued ability to take appropriate actions to respond to these conditions. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change (In millions, except per share data) Revenues $ 19,014 $ 19,176 1 % $ 18,627 3 % Cost of sales 10,214 10,572 3 % 10,240 3 % Gross margin 8,800 8,604 2 % 8,387 3 % Gross margin % 46.3 % 44.9 % 45.0 % Selling and administrative expense 6,326 6,150 3 % 5,954 3 % % of Revenues 33.3 % 32.1 % 32.0 % Restructuring charges 195 Goodwill impairment 199 Intangible and other asset impairment 202 Income before income taxes 2,517 1,957 29 % 2,503 22 % Net income 1,907 1,487 28 % 1,883 21 % Diluted earnings per share 3.86 3.03 27 % 3.74 19 % Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding Non Comparable Items(1) Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09Change (dollars in millions, except per share data) Net income, as reported $ 1,907 $ 1,487 28 % Add: Restructuring charges, net of tax(2) 145 Umbro impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets, net of tax(3) 241 Net income, excluding non comparable items $ 1,907 $ 1,873 2 % Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 3.86 $ 3.03 27 % Add: Restructuring charges, net of tax(2) 0.29 Umbro impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets, net of tax(3) 0.49 Diluted earnings per share, excluding non comparable items $ 3.86 $ 3.81 1 % Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 493.9 490.7 (1) This schedule is intended to satisfy the quantitative reconciliation for non GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, this schedule is provided to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding these non comparable items for fiscal 2009. (2) During fiscal 2009, we announced a plan to restructure the organization of the Company. As part of this plan, we streamlined our management structure and eliminated redundancies to enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market, and establish a more scalable cost structure. As a result of these actions, we recorded $195 million of pre tax restructuring charges in fiscal 2009. (3) During fiscal 2009, we recorded a non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Umbros goodwill, indefinite lived trademark and other assets. The tax benefit related to this impairment charge reduced our effective tax rate by 250 basis points for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009. 24 Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Results Revenues Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges(1) Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change FY09 vs.FY08% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges(1) (In millions) Revenues $ 19,014 $ 19,176 1 % 2 % $ 18,627 3 % 4 % (1) Results have been restated using exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE, Inc. declined 2%, driven primarily by a 2% decline in revenues for the NIKE Brand. All of our geographies delivered lower revenues with the exception of Emerging Markets, reflecting a challenging economic environment across most markets, most notably in our Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe geographies. By product group, revenues for our worldwide NIKE Brand footwear business were down 1% compared to the prior year. Worldwide NIKE Brand apparel and equipment revenues declined 5% and 7%, respectively. While our wholesale business remains the largest component of our NIKE Brand revenues, our NIKE owned retail business continues to grow, representing approximately 15% of our total NIKE Brand revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to 13% in fiscal 2009. Revenues from our Other Businesses were comprised of results from Cole Haan, Converse, Inc., Hurley International, LLC, NIKE Golf and Umbro, Ltd. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased by 4% for fiscal 2010, driven by increased revenues at Converse, Umbro and Hurley, which more than offset revenue declines at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan. Futures Orders Translated into US dollars at prior year exchange rates, worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2010 were 10% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. This futures growth was driven by increases in unit sales volume for our footwear products and growth in average unit price for both of our apparel and footwear products. Futures orders increased 7% when translated at forecasted exchange rates for the next six months, which approximate current spot rates. The reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year over year changes in shipment timing, and because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at once orders and that the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between advance/futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at once and close out sales of NIKE footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE equipment, sales from our Other Businesses and certain retail sales across all brands. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE, Inc. grew 4%, driven primarily by a 4% increase in revenues for the NIKE Brand. The North America geography contributed nearly 1 percentage point of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2009, while the remaining geographies contributed 25 Table of Contents over 2 percentage points. During fiscal 2009, most of our geographies posted higher revenues. By product group, our worldwide NIKE Brand footwear business reported revenue growth of 6% and contributed $575 million of incremental revenue. Worldwide NIKE Brand apparel revenues were in line with the prior year, while equipment revenues declined 2% or $20 million. Our Other Businesses, comprised of results from Cole Haan, Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE Golf, and Umbro in fiscal 2009, constituted the remaining revenue. In fiscal 2008, our Other Businesses also included Exeter Brands Group (whose primary business was the Starter brand business which was sold on December 17, 2007) and NIKE Bauer Hockey (which was sold on April 17, 2008). Umbro was acquired on March 3, 2008. Revenues for these businesses were flat compared to fiscal 2008. Gross Margin Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change (In millions) Gross Margin $ 8,800 $ 8,604 2% $ 8,387 3% Gross Margin % 46.3 % 44.9 % 140 bps 45.0 % (10 bps ) Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, our consolidated gross margin percentage was 140 basis points higher than the prior year. The primary factors contributing to this improvement were as follows: Improved in line product margins across most geographies, driven by reduced raw material and freight costs as well as favorable changes in product mix; Improved inventory positions, most notably in North America and Western Europe, which drove a shift in mix from discounted close out to higher margin in line sales; and Growth of NIKE owned retail as a percentage of total revenue, across most NIKE Brand geographies, driven by an increase in both new store openings and comparable store sales. Together, these factors increased consolidated gross margins by approximately 160 basis points for fiscal 2010. These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates, primarily affecting our Emerging Markets and Central and Eastern Europe geographies. We anticipate our gross margins in fiscal 2011 may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic factors including changes in currency exchange rates and rising costs for product input costs. We also anticipate higher air freight costs as we work with our suppliers to meet increasing demand for certain running footwear products in the first half of the year. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 During fiscal 2009, the primary factors contributing to the 10 basis point decline in consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year were lower gross pricing margins and increased discounts which, when combined, decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 60 basis points. This decrease was partially offset by improved hedge rates relative to the prior year, primarily in the Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe geographies. Gross pricing margins were lower, primarily driven by higher product input costs, most notably for footwear products. Higher levels of discounts were provided across all businesses in fiscal 2009 to manage inventory levels. 26 Table of Contents Selling and Administrative Expense Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs. FY09% Change Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs. FY08% Change (In millions) Operating overhead expense $ 3,970 $ 3,798 5% $ 3,645 4% Demand creation expense(1) 2,356 2,352 0% 2,309 2% Selling and administrative expense $ 6,326 $ 6,150 3% $ 5,954 3% % of Revenues 33.3 % 32.1% 120 bps 32.0 % 10 bps (1) Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased selling and administrative expense by 1 percentage point in fiscal 2010. Excluding changes in exchange rates, operating overhead expense increased 4% compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in performance based compensation and investments in NIKE owned retail. These increases were partially offset by reductions in compensation spending in fiscal 2010 as a result of restructuring activities that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, changes in currency exchange rates had a minimal impact on demand creation expense. Demand creation expense remained flat compared to the prior year, as increases in sports marketing and digital marketing expenses were offset by reductions in advertising. In fiscal 2011, we will continue to focus our resources on those investments that drive sustainable and profitable growth. We expect demand creation will increase at a slightly slower rate than revenues, with spending weighted toward the first quarter driven by key events including the 2010 World Cup. We anticipate operating overhead will grow at a mid single digit rate, with faster growth in the first half of the fiscal year, driven by increased investments in our NIKE owned retail business. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased selling and administrative expense by 2 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Excluding changes in exchange rates, operating overhead increased 6% during fiscal 2009. The increase in operating overhead was primarily attributable to investments in growth drivers such as NIKE owned retail in the North America, Western Europe, Greater China, and Japan geographies, infrastructure for the Emerging Markets and Central and Eastern Europe geographies as well as for our non NIKE Brand businesses, which more than offset steps taken to reduce operating overhead spending, including implementation of a hiring freeze and reductions in spending for travel and meetings. On a constant currency basis, demand creation expense increased 3% during fiscal 2009. Demand creation spending decreased in the second half of fiscal 2009 as a result of actions taken to reduce spending across nearly all demand creation related activities, most notably traditional media and print advertising. The increase in demand creation during the first half of fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to strategic investments, including first quarter spending around the Beijing Summer Olympics and the European Football Championships, and increased investments in athlete and team endorsements across all geographies. Restructuring Charges During fiscal 2009, we restructured the organization to streamline our management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure. As a result 27 Table of Contents of these actions, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 5% and incurred pre tax restructuring charges of $195 million in fiscal 2009, primarily consisting of cash severance costs. These charges are included in Corporate for segment reporting purposes. Goodwill, Intangible and Other Asset Impairment In fiscal 2009, we recognized a $401 million pre tax non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Umbros goodwill, intangible and other assets. Although Umbros financial performance for fiscal 2009 was slightly better than we had originally expected, projected future cash flows had fallen below the levels we expected at the time of acquisition. This erosion was a result of both the unprecedented decline in global consumer markets, particularly in the United Kingdom, and our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business. We measured the fair value of Umbro by using an equal weighting of the fair value implied by a discounted cash flow analysis and by comparisons with the market values of similar publicly traded companies. We believe the use of both models compensated for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis, and this combination was indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation. The fair value of Umbros indefinite lived trademark was estimated using the relief from royalty method, which assumes that the trademark has value to the extent that Umbro is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the trademark. Our assessments resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of $199 million and $181 million related to Umbros goodwill and trademark, respectively, in fiscal 2009. In addition to the impairment analysis, we determined an equity investment held by Umbro was also impaired, and recognized a charge of $21 million related to the impairment of that investment. These charges are included in our Other Businesses category for segment reporting purposes. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4 Acquisition, Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other (Income) Expense, net Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs. FY09% Change Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs. FY08% Change (In millions) Other (income) expense, net $ (49 ) $ (89 ) 45 % $ 8 Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Other (income) expense, net is primarily comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non functional currencies, the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, and unusual or non recurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business. For fiscal 2010, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains and the recognition of previously deferred licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey. For fiscal 2010, we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency denominated profits from our international businesses and the year over year change in foreign currency related gains included in other (income) expense, net increased our income before income taxes by approximately $34 million. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For fiscal 2009, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of $43 million of foreign currency conversion gains and the recognition of $24 million of licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of the 28 Table of Contents NIKE Bauer Hockey business. For fiscal 2008, other (income) expense, net was primarily comprised of a $32 million gain on the sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey and a $29 million gain on the sale of the Starter brand business, as well as foreign currency conversion losses of $77 million. For fiscal 2009, we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency denominated profits from our international businesses and the year over year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other (income) expense, net increased our income before income taxes by approximately $124 million. Income Taxes Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs. FY09% Change Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs. FY08% Change Effective tax rate 24.2 % 24.0 % 20 bps 24.8 % (80 ) bps Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 20 basis points higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2009. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 includes a tax benefit related to charges recorded for the impairment of Umbros goodwill, intangible and other assets. Excluding this tax benefit, our effective rate for fiscal 2009 would have been 26.5%, 230 basis points higher than our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to the continued benefit from our international operations, where tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. We estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011 will be in line with our fiscal 2010 effective tax rate. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 80 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 due primarily to the tax benefit related to the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro which had a favorable impact of 250 basis points. Profits earned outside of the U.S., the impact of the resolution of foreign audit items and the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit also favorably impacted our fiscal 2009 effective tax rate. Reflected in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was a one time tax benefit of $105 million, which had a favorable impact of 420 basis points on our effective tax rate. Operating Segments As part of the restructuring initiative that took place in fiscal 2009, the Company changed the geographic structure of NIKE Brand to six geographies to streamline its management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure. Effective June 1, 2009, the Companys new reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand became: North America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Previously, NIKE Brand operations were organized into four regions: U.S., Europe, Middle East and Africa (collectively, EMEA), Asia Pacific, and Americas. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and are used to record any non functional currency revenues or product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Geographic operating segment revenues and cost of sales reflect use of these standard rates. For all NIKE Brand operating segments, differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the centrally managed foreign 29 Table of Contents exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, foreign currency hedge results along with other conversion gains and losses generated by the Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographies.

(3) Corporate primarily consists of results from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to our geographic operating segments. Effective June 1, 2009, the primary financial measure we use to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (commonly referred to as EBIT) which represents net income before interest expense (income), net and income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Previously, we evaluated the performance of individual operating segments based on income before income taxes. Financial information has been reclassified to conform to the new primary financial measure we use. As discussed in Note 19 Operating Segments and Related Information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in EBIT of our operating segments. 30 Table of Contents The breakdown of earnings before interest and taxes is as follows: Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009(1) FY10 vs.FY09% Change Fiscal 2008(1) FY09 vs.FY08% Change (dollars in millions) North America $ 1,538 $ 1,429 8 % $ 1,460 2 % Western Europe 856 939 9 % 923 2 % Central and Eastern Europe 281 415 32 % 358 16 % Greater China 637 575 11 % 431 33 % Japan 180 205 12 % 179 15 % Emerging Markets 493 343 44 % 307 12 % Global Brand Divisions (867 ) (811 ) 7 % (737 ) 10 % Total NIKE Brand 3,118 3,095 1 % 2,921 6 % Other Businesses 299 (193 ) 359 154 % Corporate (894 ) (955 ) 6 % (854 ) 12 % Total NIKE Consolidated Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 2,523 $ 1,947 30 % $ 2,426 20 % Interest expense (income), net 6 (10 ) (77 ) 87 % Total NIKE Consolidated Income Before Income Taxes $ 2,517 $ 1,957 29 % $ 2,503 22 % (1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal year 2010 presentation.

This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our NIKE owned retail business, driven primarily by an increase in comparable store sales. On a currency neutral basis, futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 7% higher compared to the same period in the prior year. During fiscal 2010, the decrease in North America footwear revenue was primarily attributable to a low single digit percentage decrease in unit sales, while average selling price per pair remained flat. The decline in unit sales was primarily driven by lower sales for our kids and running products in the first half of fiscal 2010. 31 Table of Contents North America apparel revenue during fiscal 2010 was flat when compared to fiscal 2009, which was reflective of a high single digit percentage increase in average selling price per unit, offset by a low double digit percentage decrease in unit sales. Both the increase in average selling price per unit and the decrease in unit sales were primarily a result of fewer close out sales compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2010, the increase in North Americas EBIT was primarily the result of improved gross margins combined with a slight decrease in selling and administrative expense, driven by a reduction in demand creation expense compared to prior year. The improvement in gross margin was mainly attributable to a shift in mix from close out to in line sales, growth of NIKE owned retail as a percentage of total sales, improved in line product margins and lower warehousing costs. The reduction in demand creation expense was primarily attributable to lower spending on advertising. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 During fiscal 2009, the increase in North America footwear revenue was the result of low single digit growth in both unit sales and average selling price per pair. The growth in unit sales was primarily driven by higher demand for our Jordan brand, action sports and kids products. The increase in average selling price per pair was attributable to selective price increases, primarily during the first half of fiscal 2009, and increased sales mix of higher priced Jordan brand products, partially offset by increased sales mix of kids products which are generally lower priced. The year over year decrease in North America apparel revenues during fiscal 2009 reflected a mid single digit decrease in unit sales, primarily driven by a reduction in products sold to value channel retailers and generally softer demand in the overall apparel market. Average selling prices increased slightly as a result of the reduction in products sold to value retailers, mostly offset by an increased mix of close out sales and higher levels of discounts provided retailers to manage inventory levels. EBIT for the North America geography declined in fiscal 2009 as a result of higher operating overhead expense and lower gross margins. The increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in NIKE owned retail. Gross margins decreased as a result of higher warehousing costs, higher retail inventory markdowns and increased customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels.

Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, futures orders scheduled for delivery during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 11% higher compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by strong growth across most markets and product categories. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the decrease in footwear revenue during fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of low single digit decreases in both average selling price and unit sales. The decrease in average selling price was attributable to higher customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels, while the reduction in unit sales was due to lower sales for most NIKE Brand product categories. The year over year decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a high single digit decline in unit sales combined with a mid single digit decrease in average selling price. The decrease in unit sales was due to lower sales for most NIKE Brand product categories, while the decrease in average selling price was a result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels. For fiscal 2010, EBIT for Western Europe declined at a faster rate than revenues, as the increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues more than offset the improvements in gross margin percentage. The increase in selling administrative expense was primarily driven by a higher level of both demand creation spending around the 2010 World Cup and operating overhead expense as a result of investments in NIKE owned retail and higher performance based compensation. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to higher in line product margins, a smaller proportion of close out sales and reduced inventory obsolescence expense as a result of our leaner inventory positions. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, a number of markets within the geography experienced lower revenues, reflecting a more difficult retail environment. Revenues for the Southern European markets, including Spain, Italy and France declined, while the U.K. & Ireland remained flat compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in footwear revenue was attributable to a low single digit growth in unit sales. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for kids and NIKE Brand sportswear products. Average selling price per pair remained flat compared to the prior year. The decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by lower average selling prices resulting from a higher mix of close out sales and higher levels of discounts provided to retailers to manage inventory levels, which more than offset a low single digit increase in unit sales. The year over year increase in EBIT for the Western Europe geography during fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage, partially offset by slightly higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to improved year over year standard currency rates which more than offset higher warehousing costs and discounts on in line products. The increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was mainly driven by retail expansion across the geography. 33 Table of Contents Central and Eastern Europe Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change FY09 vs.FY08% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (dollars in millions) Revenues Footwear $ 660 $ 752 12 % 13 % $ 702 7 % 13 % Apparel 399 508 21 % 22 % 499 2 % 5 % Equipment 91 113 19 % 19 % 108 5 % 8 % Total Revenues $ 1,150 $ 1,373 16 % 17 % $ 1,309 5 % 9 % Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 281 $ 415 32 % $ 358 16 % Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Economic conditions in Central and Eastern Europe remained difficult as most markets within the geography experienced lower revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. We are beginning to see signs of stabilization in these markets as a result of improving macroeconomic conditions, increasing brand momentum, and tight management of inventory. On a currency neutral basis, future orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 3% higher compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in footwear revenue was due to a decline in average selling price, while unit sales remained flat compared to fiscal 2009. The decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels. The year over year decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a double digit decrease in average selling price and a mid single digit decline in unit sales. The decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels, while the decline in unit sales was due to lower sales in most key product categories. The year over year decrease in Central and Eastern Europes EBIT during fiscal 2010 was the result of lower revenues, a decline in gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expense. The decline in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to less favorable year over year standard currency rates, as well as higher discounts provided to customers. The increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in the reserve for bad debts along with increased investments in NIKE owned retail. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 On a currency neutral basis, revenue for the Central and Eastern Europe geography grew by approximately 9 percentage points in fiscal 2009, driven by stronger results in Russia. The increase in footwear revenue was primarily attributable to a double digit growth in unit sales. The growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for NIKE Brand sportswear, kids, and running products. The increase in apparel revenues was primarily driven by a double digit percentage increase in unit sales, partially offset by a mid single digit decrease in average selling price, resulting from a higher mix of close out sales. 34 Table of Contents The year over year increase in EBIT for Central and Eastern Europe during fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by higher revenues and improved gross margin percentage. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to improved in line product margins which more than offset higher discounts on in line products and warehousing costs.

Greater China began to gain momentum in the second half of fiscal 2010, as revenues increased 11% as compared to the second half of fiscal 2009. On a currency neutral basis, futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 16% higher compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in footwear revenue was primarily driven by a mid single digit increase in average selling price, partially offset by a mid single digit decrease in unit sales. The increase in average selling price was primarily due to strategic product pricing increases, while the decrease in unit sales was primarily driven by lower discounts on in line products compared to the prior year. The decrease in apparel revenue for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a mid single digit decrease in unit sales across most major categories, which more than offset a low single digit increase in average selling price primarily driven by strategic product pricing increases. EBIT for Greater China increased at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margins and reductions in demand creation spending attributable to comparisons against higher prior year spending around the Beijing Olympics. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Greater China continued to deliver strong results in fiscal 2009 as revenues increased 21% on a currency neutral basis, driven by expansion in both the number of stores selling NIKE products and sales through existing stores. Chinas rate of revenue growth slowed to 6% on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as we lapped very strong growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The increase in both footwear and apparel revenues was driven primarily by a double digit increase in unit sales. The growth in unit sales was partially offset by a reduction in average selling price in fiscal 2009, resulting primarily from increased discounts on in line products provided to retailers to manage inventory levels. 35 Table of Contents The increase in EBIT for Greater China for fiscal 2009 was driven by higher revenues, which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. Selling and administrative expense increased, but represented a lower percentage of revenues for fiscal 2009. The increase in selling and administrative expense during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to retail and infrastructure expansion and spending around brand events.

The decline in revenues was reflective of a difficult and highly promotional marketplace in Japan. As we enter fiscal 2011, we anticipate macroeconomic conditions in Japan to remain difficult. On a currency neutral basis, futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 16% lower compared to the same period in the prior year. For fiscal 2010, the decrease in Japans EBIT was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense, driven by increased investments in NIKE owned retail, which more than offset improved gross margins. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For fiscal 2009, the increase in Japans footwear revenue was driven primarily by a mid single digit increase in unit sales, partially offset by a reduction in average selling price. The slight increase in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a low single digit increase in average selling price, while unit sales remained flat compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in EBIT for fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal 2008. 36 Table of Contents Emerging Markets Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08% Change FY09 vs.FY08% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (dollars in millions) Revenues Footwear $ 1,356 $ 1,106 23 % 21 % $ 1,031 7 % 20 % Apparel 532 438 21 % 19 % 436 0 % 14 % Equipment 154 158 3 % 4 % 163 3 % 8 % Total Revenues $ 2,042 $ 1,702 20 % 18 % $ 1,630 4 % 17 % Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 493 $ 343 44 % $ 307 12 % Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, all markets in the Emerging Markets geography reported revenue growth for fiscal 2010, most notably Brazil, Mexico and Korea, driven by sales growth in all product categories. Futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 increased 30% on a currency neutral basis. Footwear revenue growth was primarily driven by a double digit growth in unit sales and a mid single digit increase in average selling price per pair during fiscal 2010, reflective of strong demand for most NIKE Brand product categories in all markets within the geography. For fiscal 2010, the increase in Emerging Markets EBIT was primarily the result of revenue growth combined with lower selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a decrease in gross margin percentage. The decrease in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to lower operating overhead expense resulting from fiscal 2009 restructuring activities. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to less favorable year over year standard currency rates assigned to the geography, which more than offset improved in line product margins. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, most markets in the Emerging Markets geography reported revenue growth in fiscal 2009, led by Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. The increase in footwear revenue was primarily driven by a double digit increase in unit sales, partially offset by a low single digit reduction in average selling price. The increase in EBIT for fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of revenue growth and lower selling and administrative expense. The decrease in selling and administrative expense was mainly driven by a reduction in spending around advertising and sports marketing. 37 Table of Contents Global Brand Divisions Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09 % Change FY10 vs.FY09 % ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08 % Change FY09 vs.FY08 % ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (dollars in millions) Revenues $ 105 $ 96 9 % 12 % $ 118 19 % 9 % Loss Before Interest and Taxes $ (867 ) $ (811 ) 7 % $ (737 ) 10 % Global Brand Divisions primarily represent NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment and selling, general and administrative expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand.

The increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by the centralization of certain marketing production costs. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 The increase in Global Brand Divisions loss before interest and taxes was mainly attributable to a decrease in licensing revenues and an increase in selling and administrative expense driven by higher operating overhead and increased demand creation spending.

For fiscal 2010, the increase in Other Businesses revenue was primarily driven by revenue growth at Converse, Umbro and Hurley, which more than offset the declines at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets. In fiscal 2009, EBIT for our Other Businesses included a $401 million pre tax non cash charge relating to the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro. Excluding this impairment charge, EBIT for our Other Businesses would have increased 43%, as a result of higher revenues, improved gross margins across most businesses, and lower demand creation spending. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 For fiscal 2009, our Other Businesses were comprised of Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, NIKE Golf and Umbro. For fiscal 2008, our Other Businesses primarily included Cole Haan, Converse, Exeter (whose primary business was the Starter brand business which was sold on December 17, 2007), Hurley, NIKE Bauer Hockey (which was sold on April 17, 2008), NIKE Golf and Umbro (which was acquired on March 3, 2008). Excluding the loss of revenue from NIKE Bauer Hockey and the Starter brand business and the addition of Umbro, Other Businesses revenues for fiscal 2009 would have increased 6%, driven by the strong performance from Converse and Hurley, offset by sales decreases at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan, due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets. EBIT for Other Businesses declined for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of a $401 million pre tax non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of Umbros goodwill intangible and other assets. Excluding the impairment charge, the loss of income from NIKE Bauer Hockey and the Starter brand business along with the dilutive impact of Umbro, earnings before interest and taxes for Other Businesses would have decreased by 28%, driven by declines in operating results at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan.

Corporate Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09 % Change Fiscal 2008 FY09 vs.FY08 % Change (dollars in millions) Revenues $ (24 ) $ $ Loss Before Interest and Taxes $ (894 ) $ (955 ) 6 % $ (854 ) 12 % Fiscal 2010 Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency revenue related hedge gains and losses generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to these entities, which are used to record any non functional currency revenues into the entitys functional currency. Corporates loss before interest and taxes consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, which includes expenses associated with centrally managed departments, depreciation and amortization related to the Companys corporate headquarters, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses, corporate eliminations and other items. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results include all other foreign currency hedge results generated through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management 39 Table of Contents program, other conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non functional currencies, and gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to each entity in NIKE Brand geographic operating segments, which are used to record any non functional currency product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Prior to fiscal 2010, all foreign currency results, including hedge results and other conversion gains and losses, generated by the Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographic results. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 In fiscal 2009, results for Corporate included a pre tax restructuring charge of $195 million. Excluding this restructuring charge, loss before interest and taxes for Corporate would have increased by 18%, primarily driven by an increase in performance based compensation. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 The increase in Corporates loss before interest and taxes in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to pre tax restructuring charges of $195 million, consisting primarily of cash charges related to severance costs. In fiscal 2009, foreign currency conversion gains (losses) reported in Corporate expense totaled $46 million compared to ($76) million in fiscal 2008, which was primarily driven by a net gain from currency hedges in fiscal 2009 versus a net hedge loss in fiscal 2008. Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices Overview As a global company with significant operations outside the U.S. we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates in the normal course of business. Foreign currency fluctuations affect the recording of transactions, such as sales, purchases and intercompany transactions denominated in non functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. Our primary foreign currency exposures are related to U.S. dollar transactions at wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, as well as transactions and translation of results denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Chinese Renminbi and Japanese Yen. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. This also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements, dependent upon hedge horizons. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally, on a portfolio basis, to manage those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. on a consolidated basis. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and by hedging remaining material exposures, where practical, using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. The Companys hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Transactional exposures We transact business in various currencies and have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary, which subjects us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: 1. Inventory Purchases Most of our inventory purchases around the world are denominated in U.S. dollars. This generates foreign currency exposures for all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. A weaker U.S. dollar reduces the inventory cost in the purchasing subsidiarys functional currency whereas a stronger U.S. dollar increases the inventory cost. 40 Table of Contents 2. Non Functional Currency Revenues A portion of our Western Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound), but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency, generating foreign currency exposure. 3. Other Revenues and Costs Non functional currency revenues and costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other payments, generate foreign currency risk to a lesser extent. 4. Non functional Currency Assets and Liabilities Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations. Managing transactional exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. As of May 31, 2010, we use currency forward contracts and options with maturities up to 18 months to hedge the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including non functional currency revenues and expenses. These are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2010 and 2009 was $206 million and $248 million in assets and $25 million and $12 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of shareholders equity, and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion was a gain of $5 million for the year ended May 31, 2010. The ineffective portion was immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. Ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage foreign exchange exposure of non functional currency assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not designated as hedges under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. In these cases, the change in value of the instruments is intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related non functional currency asset or liability. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2010 and 2009 was $104 million and $13 million in assets and $140 million and $34 million in liabilities, respectively. The change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in earnings. The impact of such instruments is included in other (income) expense, net and aims to offset foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses of the exposures being hedged. Refer to Note 18 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional quantitative detail. Translational exposures Substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets and operational results of these foreign currency denominated subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non U.S. dollar balance sheets into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders equity. In preparing our consolidated statements of income, foreign exchange rate fluctuations impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. In translation, a weaker U.S. dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues and income before income taxes was a net translation benefit (detriment) of approximately $147 million and $33 million, respectively, for the year ended May 31, 2010 and approximately ($199) million and $4 million, respectively, for the year ended May 31, 2009. 41 Table of Contents Managing translational exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. dollar denominated available for sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. dollar denominated securities at non U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and options to partially, or entirely, hedge the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. dollar investments. This has the effect of partially offsetting the year over year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available for sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fair value of instruments used in this manner at May 31, 2010 and 2009 was $78 million and $104 million in assets, respectively. There were no instruments in a liability position at May 31, 2010 or 2009. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in other (income) expense, net in the period during which the hedged available for sale investment is sold and affects earnings. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any period presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. We estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency denominated profits from our international businesses and the year over year change in foreign currency related gains included in other (income) expense, net had a favorable impact of approximately $34 million and $124 million on our income before income taxes for fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Refer to Note 18 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional quantitative detail. Net investments in foreign subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. During fiscal 2008, we began to hedge certain net investment positions in Euro functional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on net investments with the effect of preserving the value of future repatriated earnings. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any period presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income) expense, net. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI; concurrent with settlement, we enter into new forward contracts at the current market rate. The fair value of outstanding net investment hedges at May 31, 2010 and 2009 were $32 million in assets and $23 million in liabilities, respectively. Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled $5 million and $191 million in the years ended May 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $3.2 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009. Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2010 was net income of $1.9 billion as well as positive cash flows from working capital. Our working capital provided a net positive cash flow of $0.7 billion for fiscal 2010 as compared to a net cash outflow of $0.4 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase in cash flows from working capital 42 Table of Contents was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, driven by timing of fourth quarter expenses, a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of a shorter collection cycle and slightly lower revenues, and a decrease in inventories, reflective of tighter inventory buys compared to fiscal 2009. Cash used by investing activities was $1.3 billion during fiscal 2010, compared to $0.8 billion for fiscal 2009. The year over year increase was primarily due to net purchases of short term investments of $0.9 billion (net of sales and maturities) in fiscal 2010 compared to $0.5 billion in net purchases of short term investments during fiscal 2009. Also contributing to the year over year increase in cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2010 was a reduction in proceeds for the settlement of net investment hedges compared to the prior year period. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in cash used for purchases of property, plant and equipment. Cash used by financing activities was $1.1 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to $0.7 billion used in fiscal 2009. The increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in payments of notes payable and long term debt as well as an increase in share repurchases and dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options. In fiscal 2010, we purchased 11.3 million shares of NIKEs Class B common stock for $754 million. During fiscal 2010, we concluded our previous four year, $3 billion share repurchase program that was approved by the Board of Directors in June 2006. During this program, we repurchased a total of 53.9 million shares. Having completed the program, during the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we began repurchases under the four year $5 billion program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008. Of the total 11 million shares repurchased during fiscal 2010, 6.6 million shares were repurchased under this program for $454 million. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2010, and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, Description of Commitment 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 334 $ 264 $ 220 $ 177 $ 148 $ 466 $ 1,609 Long term Debt 7 178 47 57 7 142 438 Endorsement Contracts(1) 675 638 568 508 411 990 3,790 Product Purchase Obligations(2) 2,676 2,676 Other(3) 267 108 114 8 3 1 501 Total $ 3,959 $ 1,188 $ 949 $ 750 $ 569 $ 1,599 $ 9,014 (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for 43 Table of Contents bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. (2) We generally order product at least 4 to 5 months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2010. (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2010. The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $282 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2010. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. We also have the following outstanding short term debt obligations as of May 31, 2010. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 7 Short Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as ofMay 31, 2010 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ 139 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 88 As of May 31, 2010, letters of credit of $101 million were outstanding, generally for the purchase of inventory. Capital Resources In December 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which $760 million in debt securities may be issued. As of May 31, 2010, no debt securities had been issued under this shelf registration. We may issue debt securities under the shelf registration in fiscal 2011 depending on general corporate needs. As of May 31, 2010, we had no amounts outstanding under our multi year, $1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks. The facility matures in December 2012. Based on our current long term 44 Table of Contents senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.15%. The facility fee is 0.05% of the total commitment. If our long term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2010, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. As of May 31, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under this program. We may issue commercial paper from time to time during fiscal 2011 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively. Despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We believe that current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and inputs used, the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. This guidance became effective for us beginning March 1, 2010, except for disclosures relating to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not and will not impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations. See Note 6 Fair Value Measurements in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures required under this guidance. In February 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance on subsequent events. Under this amended guidance, SEC filers are no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised financial statements. This guidance was effective immediately and we adopted these new requirements since the third quarter of fiscal 2010. In June 2009, the FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the Codification) as the single source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for all non governmental entities. The Codification, which launched July 1, 2009, changes the referencing and organization of accounting guidance. The Codification became effective for us beginning September 1, 2009. The issuance of FASB Codification did not change GAAP and therefore the adoption has only affected how specific references to GAAP literature are disclosed in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 Table of Contents In April 2009, the FASB updated guidance related to fair value measurements to clarify the guidance related to measuring fair value in inactive markets, to modify the recognition and measurement of other than temporary impairments of debt securities, and to require public companies to disclose the fair values of financial instruments in interim periods. This updated guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. See Note 6 Fair Value Measurements in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures required under the updated guidance. In June 2008, the FASB issued new accounting guidance applicable when determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities. This guidance clarifies that share based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive non forfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method. This guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or earnings per share. In April 2008, the FASB issued amended guidance regarding the determination of the useful life of intangible assets. The guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. The intent of the position is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset. This guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued amended guidance regarding business combinations, establishing principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any resulting goodwill, and any non controlling interest in an acquiree in its financial statements. This guidance also provides for disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination. This amended guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this amended guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements, but could impact the accounting for future business combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance regarding the accounting and reporting for non controlling interests in subsidiaries. This guidance clarifies that non controlling interests in subsidiaries should be accounted for as a component of equity separate from the parents equity. This guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. We do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial positions or results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that revised the guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE). This new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a VIE and requires an ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. This guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard. 46 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict 47 Table of Contents future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value. We review the carrying value of long lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in 48 Table of Contents which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry, and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis. Indefinite lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. In measuring the fair value for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief from royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain resulting receivable or payable balances. When specific criteria for hedge accounting have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into 49 Table of Contents net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or when it is not probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the ineffective portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which such changes occur. Once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction. We use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When appropriately designated as a hedge, the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred. Stock based Compensation We account for stock based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock based compensation on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods, stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. 50 Table of Contents We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year to date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate. On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (income) expense, net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive or negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash 51 Table of Contents flows. This also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party and intercompany transactions. We also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When we begin hedging exposures, the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within 12 to 18 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than 12 months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euros, Japanese Yen and British Pounds. See Section Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices under Item 7 for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive fixed, pay variable interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value at Risk (VaR). Our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $17 million and $68 million at May 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The VaR decreased year over year as a result of reduced total notional value of our foreign 52 Table of Contents currency derivative portfolio combined with decreased foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2010. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $52 million and $207 million during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. We, therefore, consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. Details of third party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.
