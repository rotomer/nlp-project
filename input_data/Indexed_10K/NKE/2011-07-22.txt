Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells high quality footwear, apparel, equipment and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE owned retail stores and internet sales, which we refer to as our Direct to Consumer operations, and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees, worldwide. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long term revenue growth by creating innovative, must have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering compelling retail presentation and experiences. In addition to achieving long term revenue growth, we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas: Making our supply chain a competitive advantage through operational discipline, Reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing and product design that strives to eliminate waste, Improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin, and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of brands to eliminate duplicative costs, Improving working capital efficiency, and Deploying capital effectively to create value for our shareholders. Through execution of this strategy, our long term financial goals continue to be: High single digit revenue growth, Mid teens earnings per share growth, Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows, and Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses. 23 Table of Contents Over the past ten years, we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals. During this time, NIKE, Incs revenues and earnings per share have grown 8% and 15%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. Our return on invested capital has increased from 14% to 22% and we expanded gross margins by more than 5 percentage points. Our fiscal 2011 results demonstrated our continued focus toward meeting our financial goals, while positioning ourselves for sustainable, profitable long term growth. Despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2011, we delivered record high revenues and diluted earnings per share. Our revenues grew 10% to $20.9 billion, net income increased 12% to $2.1 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $4.39, a 14% increase from fiscal 2010. Income before income taxes increased 13% for fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the increase in revenues and leverage on selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a decrease in gross margin percentage. The increase in revenues is reflective of increased demand for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel products across most businesses, particularly in the North America, Emerging Markets and Greater China geographies. Demand for our NIKE Brand footwear and apparel was fueled by our innovative products as well as strong category focused retail presentations. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by higher product input costs, increased transportation expenses and a lower mix of licensee revenue as certain markets within our Other Businesses transitioned to NIKE, Inc. owned markets. These factors more than offset the positive impact from the growth and expanding profitability of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business and our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives. Net income for fiscal 2011 was negatively impacted by a year over year increase of 80 basis points in our effective tax rate, driven primarily by an increase in the percentage of total pre tax income earned from operations in the United States. The United States statutory tax rate is generally higher than the tax rate on operations outside the United States. For the year, diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 2% decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding driven by our share repurchases during fiscal 2011. While we increased the use of working capital in fiscal 2011 to support the growth of our businesses, we returned larger amounts of cash to our shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases compared to fiscal 2010. While we continue to believe that the Company is well positioned from a business and financial perspective, our future performance is subject to the inherent uncertainty presented by volatile macroeconomic conditions that may have an impact on our operations around the world. Our future performance is subject to our continued ability to take appropriate actions to respond to these conditions. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change (In millions, except per share data) Revenues $ 20,862 $ 19,014 10 % $ 19,176 1 % Cost of sales 11,354 10,214 11 % 10,572 3 % Gross margin 9,508 8,800 8 % 8,604 2 % Gross margin % 45.6 % 46.3 % 44.9 % Demand creation expense 2,448 2,356 4 % 2,352 0 % Operating overhead expense 4,245 3,970 7 % 3,798 5 % Total selling and administrative expense 6,693 6,326 6 % 6,150 3 % % of Revenues 32.1 % 33.3 % 32.1 % Restructuring charges 195 Goodwill impairment 199 Intangible and other asset impairment 202 Income before income taxes 2,844 2,517 13 % 1,957 29 % Net income 2,133 1,907 12 % 1,487 28 % Diluted earnings per share 4.39 3.86 14 % 3.03 27 % Consolidated Operating Results Revenues Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change FY11 vs.FY10% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges(1) Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges(1) (In millions) Revenues $ 20,862 $ 19,014 10 % 10 % $ 19,176 1 % 2 % (1) Results have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 On both a reported and currency neutral basis, revenues for NIKE, Inc. grew 10% for fiscal 2011, driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses. On a currency neutral basis, revenues for the NIKE Brand increased 10% for fiscal 2011, while revenues for our Other Businesses increased 8%. Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, every NIKE Brand geography except Japan delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2011, led by North America, which contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue increase. The Emerging Markets and Greater China contributed approximately 3 and 2 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue growth, respectively. By product group, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 11% and 9%, respectively, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues declined 2% during fiscal 2011. Fueling the growth of our NIKE Brand footwear business was the increased demand in our performance products, including the NIKE Lunar and Free technologies which are used across multiple categories. The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2011 was attributable to a high single digit percentage increase in unit sales along with a low single digit percentage increase in the average selling price per pair. The increase in unit sales was primarily driven by double digit percentage growth in Running, Mens Training, Action Sports and Womens Training products, while the increase in average selling price per pair was primarily driven by price increases on selected products 25 Table of Contents and fewer close outs as a percentage of total sales. For NIKE Brand apparel, the increase in revenue for fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by a low double digit percentage increase in unit sales attributable to strong category presentations and improved product lines, while the average selling price per unit was relatively flat. The increase in unit sales was driven by increased demand in all key categories. While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues, we continue to see growth in revenue through our Direct to Consumer channels. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations include NIKE owned in line and factory stores, as well as online sales through NIKE owned websites. For fiscal 2011, Direct to Consumer channels represented approximately 16% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 15% in fiscal 2010. On a currency neutral basis, Direct to Consumer revenues grew 16% for fiscal 2011 as we continue to expand our store network, increase comparable store sales and build our e commerce business. Comparable store sales grew 11% for fiscal 2011. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE owned in line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: the store has been open at least one year, square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year, and the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Revenues for our Other Businesses consist of results from our affiliate brands; Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and Umbro; and NIKE Golf. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for these businesses increased by 8% in fiscal 2011, reflecting double digit percentage revenue growth at Converse, Cole Haan and Hurley, and a low single digit growth at Umbro, which more than offset a mid single digit revenue decline at NIKE Golf. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for NIKE, Inc. declined 2%, driven primarily by a 2% decline in revenues for the NIKE Brand. All of our geographies delivered lower revenues with the exception of Emerging Markets, reflecting a challenging economic environment across most markets, most notably in our Western Europe and Central & Eastern Europe geographies. By product group, revenues for our worldwide NIKE Brand footwear business were down 1% compared to the prior year. Worldwide NIKE Brand apparel and equipment revenues declined 5% and 7%, respectively. Our Direct to Consumer operations represented approximately 15% of our total NIKE Brand revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to 13% in fiscal 2009. Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenues for our Other Businesses increased by 4% for fiscal 2010, driven by increased revenues at Converse, Umbro and Hurley, which more than offset revenue declines at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan. Futures Orders Futures and advance orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2011 were 15% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. This futures and advance order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 12%, primarily driven by a high single digit percentage increase in unit sales volume and a low single digit percentage increase in average price per unit for both footwear and apparel products. By geography, futures orders growth was as follows: Reported Futures OrdersGrowth Futures OrdersExcluding Currency Changes(1) North America +14 % +14 % Western Europe +11 % +1 % Central & Eastern Europe +13 % +10 % Greater China +24 % +17 % Japan 13 % 6 % Emerging Markets +25 % +23 % Total NIKE Brand Futures Orders +15 % +12 % 26 Table of Contents (1) Growth rates have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. This is due to year over year changes in shipment timing and because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and at once orders and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between advance/futures orders and actual revenues. Moreover, a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders, including at once and close out sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel, sales of NIKE Brand equipment, sales from our Direct to Consumer operations, and sales from our Other Businesses. Gross Margin Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change (In millions) Gross Margin $ 9,508 $ 8,800 8 % $ 8,604 2 % Gross Margin % 45.6 % 46.3 % (70 ) bps 44.9 % 140 bps Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, our consolidated gross margin percentage was 70 basis points lower than the prior year. The primary factors contributing to this decrease were as follows: Higher input costs across most businesses, Increased transportation costs, including additional air freight incurred to meet strong demand for NIKE Brand products across most businesses, most notably in North America, Western Europe, and Central & Eastern Europe geographies, and A lower mix of licensee revenue as distribution for certain markets within our Other Businesses transitioned from licensees to operating units of NIKE, Inc. Together, these factors decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 130 basis points for fiscal 2011, with the most significant erosion in the second half of the fiscal year. These decreases were partially offset by the positive impact from the growth and expanding profitability of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business, a higher mix of full price sales and favorable impacts from our ongoing product cost efficiency initiatives. As we head into fiscal 2012, we anticipate that our gross margins will continue to face pressure from macroeconomic factors, most notably rising product input costs as well as higher transportation costs, which may more than offset the favorable impact from our planned price increases and ongoing production cost efficiency initiatives. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, our consolidated gross margin percentage was 140 basis points higher than the prior year. The primary factors contributing to this improvement were as follows: Improved in line product margins across most geographies, driven by reduced raw material and freight costs as well as favorable changes in product mix, 27 Table of Contents Improved inventory positions, most notably in North America and Western Europe, which drove a shift in mix from discounted close out to higher margin in line sales, and Growth of NIKE owned retail as a percentage of total revenue, across most NIKE Brand geographies, driven by an increase in both new store openings and comparable store sales. Together, these factors increased consolidated gross margins by approximately 160 basis points for fiscal 2010. These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates, primarily affecting our Emerging Markets and Central & Eastern Europe geographies. Selling and Administrative Expense Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change (In millions) Demand creation expense(1) $ 2,448 $ 2,356 4 % $ 2,352 0 % Operating overhead expense 4,245 3,970 7 % 3,798 5 % Selling and administrative expense $ 6,693 $ 6,326 6 % $ 6,150 3 % % of Revenues 32.1 % 33.3 % (120 ) bps 32.1 % 120 bps (1) Demand creation consists of advertising and promotion expenses, including costs of endorsement contracts. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 In fiscal 2011, the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on selling and administrative expense. Demand creation expense increased 4% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the World Cup and World Basketball Festival in the first half of fiscal 2011, as well as increased spending around key product initiatives and investments in retail product presentation with wholesale customers. Operating overhead expense increased 7% compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations as well as growth in our wholesale operations, where we incurred higher personnel costs and travel expenses as compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 In fiscal 2010, changes in currency exchange rates had a minimal impact on demand creation expense. Demand creation expense remained flat compared to the prior year, as increases in sports marketing and digital marketing expenses were offset by reductions in advertising. Excluding changes in exchange rates, operating overhead expense increased 4% compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in performance based compensation and investments in our Direct to Consumer operations. These increases were partially offset by reductions in compensation spending in fiscal 2010 as a result of restructuring activities that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Restructuring Charges During fiscal 2009, we restructured the organization to streamline our management structure, enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure. As a result of these actions, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 5% and incurred pre tax restructuring charges of $195 million in fiscal 2009, primarily consisting of cash severance costs. These charges are included in Corporate for segment reporting purposes. 28 Table of Contents Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Assets Impairment In fiscal 2009, we recognized non cash impairment charges of $199 million and $202 million relating to Umbros goodwill, intangibles and other assets, respectively. Although Umbros financial performance for fiscal 2009 was slightly better than we had originally expected, projected future cash flows had fallen below the levels we expected at the time of acquisition. This erosion was a result of both the unprecedented decline in global consumer markets, particularly in the United Kingdom, and our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4 Acquisition, Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other (Income), net Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change (In millions) Other (income), net $ (33 ) $ (49 ) 33 % $ (89 ) 45 % Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Other (income), net is comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non recurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business. For fiscal 2011, other (income), net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains. For fiscal 2011, we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency denominated profits from our international businesses and the year over year change in foreign currency related net gains included in other (income), net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $33 million on our income before income taxes. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010 and 2009, other (income), net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains and the recognition of previously deferred licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of NIKE Bauer Hockey. For fiscal 2010, we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency denominated profits from our international businesses and the year over year change in foreign currency related net gains included in other (income), net increased our income before income taxes by approximately $34 million. Income Taxes Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change Effective tax rate 25.0 % 24.2 % 80 bps 24.0 % 20 bps Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 80 basis points higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2010 due primarily to the change in geographic mix of earnings. A larger percentage of our earnings in fiscal 2011 were attributable to operations in the U.S., where the statutory tax rate is generally higher than the tax rate on operations outside of the U.S. This impact was partially offset by changes to uncertain tax positions. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 20 basis points higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2009. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 includes a tax benefit related to charges recorded for the impairment of Umbros 29 Table of Contents goodwill, intangible and other assets. Excluding this tax benefit, our effective rate for fiscal 2009 would have been 26.5%, 230 basis points higher than our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to our international operations, as tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Operating Segments The Companys reportable operating segments are based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment. Our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets. Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment. As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and are used to record any non functional currency revenues or product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Geographic operating segment revenues and cost of sales reflect use of these standard rates. For all NIKE Brand operating segments, differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program. Prior to fiscal 2010, all foreign currency results, including hedge results and other conversion gains and losses generated by the Western Europe and Central & Eastern Europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographic results. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2011 presentation, as South Africa became part of the Emerging Markets operating segment beginning June 1, 2010. Previously, South Africa was part of the Central & Eastern Europe operating segment.

These changes had no impact on previously reported results of operations or shareholders equity. (2) Results have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. (3) Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments but managed through our central foreign exchange risk 30 Table of Contents management program, and foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to these entities, which are used to record any non functional currency revenues into the entitys functional currency. The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as EBIT) which represents net income before interest expense (income), net and income taxes in the consolidated statements of income. As discussed in Note 18 Operating Segments and Related Information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain corporate costs are not included in EBIT of our operating segments. The breakdown of earnings before interest and taxes is as follows: Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010(1) FY11 vs.FY10% Change Fiscal 2009(1) FY10 vs.FY09% Change (In millions) North America $ 1,750 $ 1,538 14 % $ 1,429 8 % Western Europe 721 856 16 % 939 9 % Central & Eastern Europe 233 253 8 % 394 36 % Greater China 777 637 22 % 575 11 % Japan 114 180 37 % 205 12 % Emerging Markets 688 521 32 % 364 43 % Global Brand Divisions (998 ) (867 ) 15 % (811 ) 7 % Total NIKE Brand 3,285 3,118 5 % 3,095 1 % Other Businesses 334 299 12 % (193 ) Corporate (771 ) (894 ) 14 % (955 ) 6 % Total Consolidated Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 2,848 $ 2,523 13 % $ 1,947 30 % Interest expense (income), net 4 6 33 % (10 ) Total Consolidated Income Before Income Taxes $ 2,844 $ 2,517 13 % $ 1,957 29 % (1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal year 2011 presentation.

Contributing to the wholesale revenue growth was strong product category presentations at our wholesale customers, improved product lines and earlier shipments of summer season 31 Table of Contents products. North Americas Direct to Consumer revenues grew 19%, which contributed approximately 4 percentage points to North Americas revenue increase. The growth in the Direct to Consumer business was fueled by 14% growth in comparable store sales. For fiscal 2011, the increase in North America footwear revenue was primarily driven by double digit percentage growth in Running, Mens and Womens Training and Football (Soccer) categories and a single digit percentage growth in Basketball, partially offset by a low single digit percentage decline in sales of our NIKE Brand Sportswear products. The year over year increase in North America apparel revenues was primarily driven by double digit percentage growth in most key categories, most notably Mens Training, Running, Basketball and Womens Training. For fiscal 2011, the increase in North Americas EBIT was primarily the result of revenue growth and leverage on selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a lower gross margin percentage. The decline in gross margin percentage was due primarily to increased air freight and product input costs, which more than offset the favorable impact from the growth of our Direct to Consumer business and fewer close out sales. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for North America declined 1%, driven primarily by a decrease in revenue from our wholesale business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our NIKE owned retail business, driven primarily by an increase in comparable store sales. During fiscal 2010, the decrease in North America footwear revenue was primarily attributable to a low single digit percentage decrease in unit sales, while average selling price per pair remained flat. The decline in unit sales was primarily driven by lower sales for our Kids and Running categories in the first half of fiscal 2010. North America apparel revenue during fiscal 2010 was flat when compared to fiscal 2009, which was reflective of a high single digit percentage increase in average selling price per unit, offset by a low double digit percentage decrease in unit sales. Both the increase in average selling price per unit and the decrease in unit sales were primarily a result of fewer close out sales compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2010, the increase in North Americas EBIT was primarily the result of improved gross margins combined with a slight decrease in selling and administrative expense, driven by a reduction in demand creation expense compared to prior year. The improvement in gross margin was mainly attributable to a shift in mix from close out to in line sales, growth of our Direct to Consumer business as a percentage of total sales, improved in line product margins and lower warehousing costs.

Revenues for the U.K. & Ireland, the largest market in Western Europe, grew 5% for fiscal 2011. Western Europes Direct to Consumer revenues grew 10%, which contributed approximately 1 percentage point to Western Europes revenue increase. The growth in the Direct to Consumer business was fueled by 6% growth in comparable store sales. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, footwear revenue in Western Europe increased 7%, driven by double digit percentage growth in our Running, Football (Soccer) and Action Sports categories, which more than offset a slight revenue decline in our NIKE Brand Sportswear category. On a currency neutral basis, apparel revenue in Western Europe increased 2%, primarily driven by double digit percentage growth in our Football (Soccer) and Running categories, which more than offset a mid single digit revenue decline in our NIKE Brand Sportswear category. For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Western Europes EBIT was driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a lower gross margin percentage, all of which more than offset the increase in revenues and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense. The decline in the gross margin percentage was significantly impacted by the unfavorable year over year standard currency rates. Also contributing to the decrease in the gross margin percentage was higher product input and air freight costs, higher royalty expenses related to sales of endorsed team products and higher full price discounts. These factors more than offset the favorable impact of fewer close out sales. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 On a currency neutral basis, most markets in Western Europe experienced lower revenues during fiscal 2010, reflecting a difficult retail environment throughout the geography. Our largest market, the U.K. & Ireland, declined 4%. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, the decrease in footwear revenue during fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of low single digit decreases in both average selling price and unit sales. The decrease in average selling price was attributable to higher customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels, while the reduction in unit sales was due to lower sales for most NIKE Brand product categories. The year over year decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a high single digit decline in unit sales combined with a mid single digit decrease in average selling price. The decrease in unit sales was due to lower sales for most NIKE Brand product categories, while the decrease in average selling price was a result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels. For fiscal 2010, EBIT for Western Europe declined at a faster rate than revenues, as the increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues more than offset the improvements in gross margin percentage. The increase in selling administrative expense was primarily driven by a higher level of both demand creation spending around the 2010 World Cup and operating overhead expense as a result of investments in our Direct to Consumer operations and higher performance based compensation. The gross margin improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to higher in line product margins, a smaller proportion of close out sales and reduced inventory obsolescence expense as a result of our leaner inventory positions. 33 Table of Contents Central & Eastern Europe Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10 %Change FY11 vs.FY10 %ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09 %Change FY10 vs.FY09 %ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 600 $ 558 8 % 11 % $ 673 17 % 16 % Apparel 356 354 1 % 4 % 468 24 % 24 % Equipment 75 81 7 % 5 % 106 24 % 21 % Total Revenues $ 1,031 $ 993 4 % 7 % $ 1,247 20 % 19 % Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 233 $ 253 8 % $ 394 36 % Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Led by Russia and Turkey, most territories within Central & Eastern Europe reported revenue growth during fiscal 2011 as economic conditions in the geography continued to show signs of recovery. The growth in Central & Eastern Europes footwear revenues was mainly driven by double digit percentage growth in our Football (Soccer), Running and Action Sports categories, while the growth in apparel revenues was primarily driven by double digit percentage growth in our Running category. For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Central & Eastern Europes EBIT was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a lower gross margin percentage, which more than offset the increase in revenues and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense. The decline in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to unfavorable year over year standard currency rates, higher air freight costs and an increase in product input costs. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Economic conditions in Central & Eastern Europe remained difficult as most markets within the geography experienced lower revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease in footwear revenue was due to a decline in average selling price, while unit sales remained flat compared to fiscal 2009. The decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels. The year over year decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a double digit decrease in average selling price and a mid single digit decline in unit sales. The decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels, while the decline in unit sales was due to lower sales in most key product categories. The year over year decrease in Central & Eastern Europes EBIT during fiscal 2010 was the result of lower revenues, a decline in gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expense. The decline in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to less favorable year over year standard currency rates, as well as higher discounts provided to customers. The increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in the reserve for bad debts along with increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations. 34 Table of Contents Greater China Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change FY11 vs.FY10% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 1,164 $ 953 22 % 19 % $ 940 1 % 1 % Apparel 789 684 15 % 13 % 700 2 % 3 % Equipment 107 105 2 % 0 % 103 2 % 0 % Total Revenues $ 2,060 $ 1,742 18 % 16 % $ 1,743 0 % 0 % Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 777 $ 637 22 % $ 575 11 % Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, Greater China revenues increased 16% for fiscal 2011, driven by expansion in the number of partner owned stores selling NIKE products, as well as improvement in comparable store sales for partner owned stores. For fiscal 2011, the increase in Greater Chinas footwear revenue was primarily driven by double digit percentage growth in our Running and NIKE Brand Sportswear categories, while the growth in apparel revenue was mainly driven by double digit percentage increases in our NIKE Brand Sportswear, Basketball and Mens Training categories. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for Greater China grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of a higher gross margin percentage, improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation. The improvement in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to higher product prices, favorable product mix and lower inventory obsolescence expense, which more than offset higher product input costs and warehousing costs from our new China distribution center. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, revenues for Greater China were flat, primarily attributable to comparisons against strong revenue growth in the first half of fiscal 2009 driven by the Beijing Olympics. Greater China began to gain momentum in the second half of fiscal 2010, as revenues increased 11% as compared to the second half of fiscal 2009. The increase in footwear revenue was primarily driven by a mid single digit increase in average selling price, partially offset by a mid single digit decrease in unit sales. The increase in average selling price was primarily due to strategic price increases, while the decrease in unit sales was primarily driven by lower discounts on in line products compared to the prior year. The decrease in apparel revenue for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a mid single digit decrease in unit sales across most major categories, which more than offset a low single digit increase in average selling price primarily driven by strategic price increases. EBIT for Greater China increased at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margins and reductions in demand creation spending attributable to comparisons against higher prior year spending around the Beijing Olympics. 35 Table of Contents Japan Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change FY11 vs.FY10% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 396 $ 433 9 % 16 % $ 430 1 % 7 % Apparel 302 357 15 % 23 % 397 10 % 17 % Equipment 68 92 26 % 32 % 99 7 % 13 % Total Revenues $ 766 $ 882 13 % 21 % $ 926 5 % 12 % Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 114 $ 180 37 % $ 205 12 % Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Macroeconomic conditions in Japan remain difficult. On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced a major earthquake and resulting tsunami. While the Companys organization and assets in Japan were not materially damaged, business results for the month of March 2011 were significantly eroded by the natural disaster. As we enter fiscal 2012, we anticipate macroeconomic conditions in Japan to remain difficult as consumer confidence continues to recover. Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, both footwear and apparel revenues in Japan declined, driven by decreases across most key categories. Partially offsetting the decreases was a double digit percentage growth in revenues from Running apparel. The decrease in Japans EBIT for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by an improvement in the gross margin percentage. The improvement in the gross margin percentage was primarily driven by favorable year over year standard currency rates and positive impacts from fewer discounts on close out sales, which more than offset higher product input costs and inventory obsolescence expense. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, both footwear and apparel revenues in Japan declined during fiscal 2010 due to decreases in unit sales across most major categories. The decline in revenues was reflective of a difficult and highly promotional marketplace in Japan. For fiscal 2010, the decrease in Japans EBIT was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense, driven by increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations, which more than offset improved gross margins. 36 Table of Contents Emerging Markets Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change FY11 vs.FY10% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (In millions) Revenues Footwear $ 1,897 $ 1,458 30 % 24 % $ 1,185 23 % 20 % Apparel 657 577 14 % 9 % 477 21 % 17 % Equipment 182 164 11 % 6 % 166 1 % 3 % Total Revenues $ 2,736 $ 2,199 24 % 19 % $ 1,828 20 % 17 % Earnings Before Interest and Taxes $ 688 $ 521 32 % $ 364 43 % Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Excluding the changes in currency exchange rates, revenues for Emerging Markets increased 19% for fiscal 2011. Most territories in the geography reported double digit revenue growth for the fiscal year, led by Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Korea. For fiscal 2011, both footwear and apparel revenue growth in the Emerging Markets was primarily driven by strong demand in nearly all key categories, most notably NIKE Brand Sportswear and Running. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for Emerging Markets grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margin percentage, improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation. The increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to a higher mix of in line product sales, lower warehousing costs and favorable year over year standard currency rates, which more than offset the increase in product input costs and higher full price discounts. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Excluding changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2010 revenue growth for the Emerging Markets geography was driven by growth in all product categories and all territories, most notably Brazil, Mexico and Korea. Footwear revenue growth was primarily driven by a double digit growth in unit sales and a mid single digit increase in average selling price per pair during fiscal 2010, reflective of strong demand for most NIKE Brand product categories in all markets within the geography. For fiscal 2010, the increase in Emerging Markets EBIT was primarily the result of revenue growth combined with lower selling and administrative expense, which more than offset a decrease in gross margin percentage. The decrease in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to lower operating overhead expense resulting from fiscal 2009 restructuring activities. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to less favorable year over year standard currency rates compared to the prior year, which more than offset improved in line product margins. 37 Table of Contents Global Brand Divisions Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change FY11 vs.FY10% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change FY10 vs.FY09% ChangeExcludingCurrencyChanges (In millions) Revenues $ 123 $ 105 17 % 21 % $ 96 9 % 12 % (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes (998 ) (867 ) 15 % (811 ) 7 % Global Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation and operating overhead expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand. Revenues for the Global Brand Divisions are attributable to NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, the increase in Global Brand Division expense was primarily due to an increase in both operating overhead and centrally managed demand creation expense. The increase in operating overhead expense was mainly driven by increased investments in our Direct to Consumer infrastructure along with higher wages and travel expense. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the World Cup and World Basketball Festival in the first half of fiscal 2011, as well as increased investments in sports marketing. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, the increase in Global Brand Division expense was largely due to increases in centrally managed demand creation expense and performance based compensation, which more than offset an increase in licensing revenues. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by the centralization of certain marketing production costs.

The revenue growth at Converse was primarily driven by increased licensing revenue in China, as 38 Table of Contents well as increased sales in the U.K. as we transitioned that market to a Converse owned distribution model. Revenues for Cole Haan increased 12%, driven by double digit percentage growth in our wholesale operations as well as high single digit percentage growth in our Direct to Consumer operations. Revenues declined at NIKE Golf, where we experienced significant erosion in our Japan business following the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. For fiscal 2011, EBIT for our Other Businesses grew at a faster rate than revenues, primarily as a result of more favorable foreign currency exchange impacts. The gross margin percentage remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011, as the favorable impact from improved product mix was offset by a lower mix of licensee revenues. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, the increase in Other Businesses revenue was primarily driven by revenue growth at Converse, Umbro and Hurley, which more than offset the declines at NIKE Golf and Cole Haan due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets. In fiscal 2009, EBIT for our Other Businesses included a $401 million pre tax non cash charge relating to the impairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets of Umbro. Excluding this impairment charge, EBIT for our Other Businesses would have increased 43%, as a result of higher revenues, improved gross margins across most businesses, and lower demand creation spending. For additional information about our impairment charges, see Note 4 Identifiable Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Umbro Impairment in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 FY11 vs.FY10% Change Fiscal 2009 FY10 vs.FY09% Change (In millions) Revenues $ 11 $ (25 ) $ (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes (771 ) (894 ) 14 % (955 ) 6 % Corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, which includes expenses associated with centrally managed departments, depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters, unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock based compensation, certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses, corporate eliminations and other items. Corporate revenues primarily consist of (1) foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program and (2) foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to these entities, which are used to record any non functional currency revenues into the entitys functional currency. In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results include all other foreign currency hedge results generated through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, other conversion gains and losses arising from re measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non functional currencies, and gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to each entity in NIKE Brand geographic operating segments, which are used to record any non functional currency product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Prior to fiscal 2010, all foreign currency results, including hedge results and other conversion gains and losses, generated by the Western Europe and Central & Eastern Europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographic results. 39 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, the decrease in Corporate expense was primarily driven by year over year net foreign currency gains generated by our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program. Also contributing to the decrease in Corporate expense for fiscal 2011 was a $54 million year over year reduction in stock options expense primarily due to a change in accelerated vesting provisions that took effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and a lower estimated fair value for stock options granted in the current year. These benefits more than offset an increase in corporate operating overhead expenses, primarily driven by higher wage related expense. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 In fiscal 2009, results for Corporate included a pre tax restructuring charge of $195 million. Excluding this restructuring charge, loss before interest and taxes for Corporate would have increased by 18% for fiscal 2010, primarily driven by an increase in performance based compensation. Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices Overview As a global company with significant operations outside the U.S., in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Foreign currency fluctuations affect the recording of transactions, such as sales, purchases and intercompany transactions denominated in non functional currencies, and the translation into U.S. dollars of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our foreign currency exposures are due primarily to U.S. dollar transactions at wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, as well as transactions and translation of results denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Chinese Renminbi and Japanese Yen. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. This also has the effect of delaying the majority of the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements, the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis, to address those risks that are material to NIKE, Inc. on a consolidated basis. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical, by hedging a portion of certain remaining material exposures, using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. Transactional exposures We transact business in various currencies and have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary, both of which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: 1. Inventory Purchases Most of our inventory purchases around the world are denominated in U.S. dollars. This generates foreign currency exposures for all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. A weaker U.S. dollar reduces the inventory cost in the purchasing subsidiarys functional currency whereas a stronger U.S. dollar increases the inventory cost. 2. Non Functional Currency Revenues A portion of our Western Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g. British Pound), but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency, generating foreign currency exposure. 3. Other Revenues and Costs Non functional currency revenues and costs, such as endorsement contracts, intercompany royalties and other payments, generate foreign currency risk to a lesser extent. 40 Table of Contents 4. Non Functional Currency Monetary Assets and Liabilities Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to re measurement, which may create fluctuations in other (income), net within our consolidated results of operations. Managing transactional exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. As of May 31, 2011, we use currency forward contracts and options with maturities up to 15 months to hedge the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including non functional currency revenues and expenses. These are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2011 and 2010 was $28 million and $206 million in assets and $136 million and $25 million in liabilities, respectively. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of shareholders equity, and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income), net. Ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. Certain currency forward contracts used to manage foreign exchange exposure of non functional currency monetary assets and liabilities subject to re measurement are not designated as hedges under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. In these cases, the change in value of the instruments is immediately recognized in other (income), net and is intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re measurement of the related non functional currency asset or liability being hedged. The fair value of these instruments at May 31, 2011 and 2010 was $9 million and $104 million in assets and $17 million and $140 million in liabilities, respectively. Refer to Note 17 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional quantitative detail. Translational exposures Substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets and operational results of these foreign currency denominated subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non U.S. dollar balance sheets into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders equity. In preparing our consolidated statements of income, foreign exchange rate fluctuations impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. In translation, a weaker U.S. dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues and income before income taxes was a net translation benefit (detriment) of approximately ($28) million and ($16) million, respectively, for the year ended May 31, 2011 and approximately $147 million and $33 million, respectively, for the year ended May 31, 2010. Managing translational exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. dollar denominated available for sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. dollar denominated securities at non U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and options to partially, or entirely, hedge the variability of 41 Table of Contents the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. dollar investments. This has the effect of partially offsetting the year over year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available for sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fair value of instruments used in this manner at May 31, 2011 was $1 million in assets and $21 million in liabilities. At May 31, 2010, the fair value was $78 million in assets. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in OCI and reclassified into earnings in other (income), net in the period during which the hedged available for sale investment is sold and affects earnings. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any period presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income), net. We estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency denominated profits from our international businesses and the year over year change in foreign currency related net gains included in other (income), net had net (detriment) benefit on our income before income taxes of approximately $(33) million and $34 million for the years ended May 31, 2011 and 2010. Refer to Note 17 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional quantitative detail. Net investments in foreign subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We hedge certain net investment positions in Euro functional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on net investments with the effect of preserving the value of future repatriated earnings. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion, which was not material for any period presented, is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other (income), net. To minimize credit risk, we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration. Upon maturity, the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI; concurrent with settlement, we enter into new forward contracts at the current market rate. The fair value of outstanding net investment hedges at May 31, 2011 was $23 million in liabilities. At May 31, 2010, the fair value was $32 million in assets. Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled ($23) million and $5 million in the years ended May 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was $1.8 billion for fiscal 2011 compared to $3.2 billion for fiscal 2010. Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2011 was net income of $2.1 billion. Our working capital was a net cash outflow of $708 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to a positive net cash inflow of $694 million for fiscal 2010. Our investments in working capital increased primarily due to an increase in inventory and higher accounts receivable. Inventory at the end of fiscal 2011 increased 33% compared to fiscal 2010, primarily driven by a 15% increase in futures orders, growth in replenishment programs for high turnover styles, early purchases of key seasonal items with longer production lead times as well as the growth of Direct to Consumer operations. Changes in currency exchange rates and higher product costs also contributed to the increase in dollar inventory. The increase in accounts receivable was mainly attributable to the increase in revenues during fiscal 2011. Cash used by investing activities was $1.0 billion during fiscal 2011, compared to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2010. The year over year decrease was primarily due to lower net purchases of short term investments. Net purchases of short term investments were $537 million (net of sales and maturities) in fiscal 2011 compared to $937 million during fiscal 2010. 42 Table of Contents Cash used by financing activities was $2.0 billion for fiscal 2011 compared to $1.1 billion used in fiscal 2010. The increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases and dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in notes payable. In fiscal 2011, we purchased 23.8 million shares of NIKEs class B common stock for $1.9 billion. These repurchases were made under the four year, $5 billion program approved by our Board of Directors which commenced in December 2009 and as of the end of fiscal 2011, we have repurchased 30.4 million shares for $2.3 billion under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash, and or debt. The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements, we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. However, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Our significant long term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2011, and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows: Description of Commitment Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31, 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating Leases $ 374 $ 310 $ 253 $ 198 $ 174 $ 535 $ 1,844 Long term Debt 200 48 58 8 109 37 460 Endorsement Contracts(1) 800 806 742 615 463 1,018 4,444 Product Purchase Obligations(2) 3,175 3,175 Other(3) 277 137 22 4 1 441 Total $ 4,826 $ 1,301 $ 1,075 $ 825 $ 747 $ 1,590 $ 10,364 (1) The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers. (2) We generally order product at least 4 to 5 months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business, that are 43 Table of Contents enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2011. (3) Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non product purchases. The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2011. The total liability for uncertain tax positions was $212 million, excluding related interest and penalties, at May 31, 2011. We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur. We also have the following outstanding short term debt obligations as of May 31, 2011. Please refer to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 7 Short Term Borrowings and Credit Lines) for further description and interest rates related to the short term debt obligations listed below. Outstanding as ofMay 31, 2011 (In millions) Notes payable, due at mutually agreed upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand $ 187 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port $ 111 As of May 31, 2011, letters of credit of $99 million were outstanding, generally for the purchase of inventory. Capital Resources In December 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which $760 million in debt securities may be issued. As of May 31, 2011, no debt securities had been issued under this shelf registration. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2011, we had no amounts outstanding under our multi year, $1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks. The facility matures in December 2012. Based on our current long term senior unsecured debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.15%. The facility fee is 0.05% of the total commitment. If our long term debt rating were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this committed credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2011, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future. 44 Table of Contents Liquidity is also provided by our $1 billion commercial paper program. As of and for the year ended May 31, 2011, no amounts were outstanding under this program. We currently have short term debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively. As of May 31, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaling $4.5 billion, including amounts held in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier 1 commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency obligations and government sponsored enterprise obligations, and other investment grade fixed income securities. Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, the average duration of our entire cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio is less than 120 days as of May 31, 2011. Despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets, to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. Future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where it is needed. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and inputs used, the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. This guidance became effective for us beginning March 1, 2010, except for disclosures relating to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 assets and liabilities, which will be effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures, the adoption did not and will not impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that revised the guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE). This new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and requires an ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. This guidance became effective for us beginning June 1, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 45 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. This new guidance requires the components of net income and other comprehensive income to be either presented in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity. While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance. This new guidance is effective for us beginning June 1, 2012. As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income, the adoption will not have an impact on our consolidated financial positions or results of operations. In April 2011, the FASB issued new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This new guidance, which is effective for us beginning June 1, 2012, amends current U.S. GAAP fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. We do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. We do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. 46 Table of Contents In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made. Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales. Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year). These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level 47 Table of Contents of performance will be maintained throughout the period. In these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers athletic performance, increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period. Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period. Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value. We review the carrying value of long lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of 48 Table of Contents the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry, and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis. Indefinite lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. In measuring the fair value for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief from royalty method. This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain non functional monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedge probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income, rather than net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the ineffective portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other (income), net during the quarter in which such changes occur. We use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. As the value of our underlying net investments in wholly owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. Accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. We consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred. Stock based Compensation We account for stock based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock based compensation on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our 49 Table of Contents common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods, stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities. Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore, and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. Conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which U.S. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. In this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year to date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs. On a quarterly basis, we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential 50 Table of Contents actions of third party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges as other (income), net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. Currently, we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive or negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. This also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons. We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third party and intercompany transactions. We also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. When we begin hedging exposures, the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions. Generally, all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within 12 to 18 months. The majority of the contracts expiring in more than 12 months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory. When intercompany loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration. Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euros, Japanese Yen and British Pounds. See Section Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices under Item 7 for additional detail. Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive fixed, pay variable interest rate swaps. Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and Value at Risk (VaR). Our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt. We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes 51 Table of Contents and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances, and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments. The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors. The estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $33 million and $17 million at May 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The VaR increased year over year primarily as a result of increased foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2011. Such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $79 million and $52 million during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. We, therefore, consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows. 52 Table of Contents Details of third party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of May 31, 2011.
