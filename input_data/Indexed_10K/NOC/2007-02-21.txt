Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Business Northrop Grumman provides technologically advanced, innovative products, services, and integrated solutions in information and services, aerospace, electronics, and shipbuilding to its global customers. As a system integrator, prime contractor, principal subcontractor, partner, or preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman participates in many high priority defense and commercial technology programs in the United States (U.S.) and abroad. Northrop Grumman conducts most of its business with the U.S. Government, principally the Department of Defense (DoD). The company also conducts business with foreign governments and makes domestic and international commercial sales. Outlook U.S. defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years. Certain programs in which the company participates may be subject to potential reductions due to a slower rate of growth in the U.S. Defense Budget forecasts and funds being diverted to support the on going Global War on Terrorism and the reordering of priorities by the DOD. Despite this trend, the company believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced, innovative products, services, and integrated solutions in systems integration, defense electronics, information technology, advanced aircraft, shipbuilding, technical services and space technology will generate revenue growth in 2007 and beyond. In 2007, based on total backlog (funded and unfunded) of approximately $61 billion as of December 31, 2006, the company expects sales to range between $31 and $32 billion and forecasts improvement in net income over 2006. The major industry and economic factors that may affect the companys future performance are described in the following paragraphs. Industry Factors While Northrop Grumman is subject to the usual vagaries of the defense marketplace, it is also affected by the unique characteristics of the defense industry as a monopsony, and by certain elements peculiar to its own business mix. Northrop Grumman, along with Lockheed Martin Corporation, The Boeing Company, Raytheon Company, and General Dynamics Corporation are among the largest companies in the U.S. defense industry at this time. Northrop Grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs, both large and small. Intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of Northrop Grummans business and the defense industry. It is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another party, turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party. It is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts. The nature of major defense programs, conducted under binding contracts, allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries. The companys success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and services, as well as its ability to provide the people, technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency. It is necessary to maintain, as the company has, sources for raw materials, fabricated parts, electronic components, and major subassemblies. In this manufacturing and systems integration environment, effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations. Economic Opportunities, Challenges, and Risks The defense of the U.S. and its allies requires the ability to respond to one or more regional conflicts, terrorist acts, or threats to homeland security, and is increasingly dependent upon early threat identification. National responses to those threats may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from dissuasion, deterrence, active defense, security and stability operations, or peacekeeping. The U.S. government continues to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry, and in minimizing collateral damage when force 28 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION must be applied in pursuit of national objectives. As a result, the U.S. and its military coalitions increasingly rely on sophisticated systems providing long range surveillance and intelligence, battle management, and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy effective force to any region. Accordingly, defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted toward the development and procurement of military platforms and systems demonstrating the stealth, long range, survivability, persistence and standoff capabilities that can overcome such obstacles to access. Additionally, advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual systems and provide for the real time integration of individual surveillance, information management, strike, and battle management platforms will also be required. While the upward trend in overall defense spending may slow, U.S. budgets are expected to continue to exhibit real growth in the coming years. While defense spending in allied countries may not match that growth, many of those allies are focusing their development and procurement efforts on advanced electronics and information systems capabilities to enhance their interoperability with U.S. forces. Of note, the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review increased the DoD focus on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and joint command and control, in support of future budget submissions. The size of future U.S. and international defense budgets is expected to remain responsive to the international security environment. The 2008 budget submitted by the President requests $481.4 billion in discretionary authority for the DoD base budget (including $141.7 billion to continue the fight in the Global War on Terrorism), representing an 11.3 percent increase over the projected enacted level for fiscal 2007. While this budget includes proposed reductions in certain programs in which the company participates or for which the company expects to compete, the company believes that spending on recapitalization and transformation of homeland security and defense assets will continue to be a national priority, with particular emphasis on areas involving intelligence and non conventional warfare capabilities. U.S. Government programs in which Northrop Grumman either participates, or strives to participate, must compete with other programs for consideration during our nations budget formulation and appropriation processes. Budget decisions made in this environment will have long term consequences for the size and structure of Northrop Grumman and the entire defense industry. Despite significant growth in the defense budget since 2001, the percent of Gross Domestic Product dedicated to the nations defense has remained relatively constant. Substantial new competitive opportunities for the company include a new aerial refueling tanker, the next generation long range bomber, space radar, unmanned vehicles, transformational satellite communications systems, restricted space based programs, technical services and information technology contracts, and several international and homeland security programs. In pursuit of these opportunities, Northrop Grumman continues to focus on operational and financial performance for continued growth in 2007 and beyond. Northrop Grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high technology areas such as stealth, airborne surveillance, battle management, systems integration, defense electronics, and information technology. The company has a significant presence in federal and civil information systems; the manufacture of combatant ships including aircraft carriers and submarines; space technology; command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) and missile systems. The company believes that its programs are a high priority for national defense. Nevertheless, under budgetary pressures and emphasis on capabilities to conduct non conventional warfare, there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced, extended, or terminated by our U.S. Government customers. The company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of non conforming items for a specified period of time. Most of the companys product warranties are provided under government contracts, the costs of which are generally incorporated into contract pricing. Prime contracts with various agencies of the U.S. Government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations, including the False Claims Act and The International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines, penalties, debarment, or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all 29 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION U.S. Government agencies. Given the companys dependence on U.S. Government business, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS 2006 In October the company announced its intent to acquire Essex Corporation (Essex). On January 25, 2007, the company completed its purchase of 100 percent of the common stock of Essex, valued at approximately $600 million, including the assumption of debt totaling $23 million and estimated transaction costs of $14 million. Essex provides signal processing services and products, and advanced optoelectronic imaging for U.S. government intelligence and defense customers. The operating results of Essex will be included as part of the Mission Systems segment from the date of acquisition. The assets, liabilities, and results of operations of Essex were not material. 2005 The company acquired Confluent RF Systems Corporation (Confluent) for $42 million, which included transaction costs of $2 million, and Integic Corporation (Integic) for $319 million, which included transaction costs of $6 million. The assets, liabilities, and results of operations of these acquired businesses were not material individually or in the aggregate, and thus pro forma information is not presented. 2004 There were no significant acquisitions during 2004. BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS 2006 The company sold the assembly business unit of Interconnect Technologies (Interconnect) and Winchester Electronics (Winchester) for net cash proceeds of $26 million and $17 million, respectively, and recognized an after tax gain of $4 million and $3 million, respectively, in discontinued operations. The results of operations of Interconnect and Winchester, reported in the Electronics segment, were not material to any of the periods presented and have therefore not been reclassified as discontinued operations. The Enterprise Information Technology (EIT) business, formerly reported in the Information Technology segment, was shut down and costs associated with the exit activities were not material. The results of operations of this business are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income, net of applicable income taxes, for all periods presented. 2005 The company sold Teldix GmbH (Teldix) for $57 million in cash and recognized an after tax gain of $14 million in discontinued operations. The results of operations of Teldix, reported in the Electronics segment, were not material to any of the periods presented and have therefore not been reclassified as discontinued operations. 2004 The companys Canadian navigation systems and space sensors systems business and Kester were sold for cash of $65 million and $60 million, respectively, and the company recorded an after tax gain of $12 million and $2 million, respectively, in discontinued operations. The results of operations of these businesses were not material to any of the periods presented and have therefore not been reclassified as discontinued operations. CONTRACTS The majority of the companys business is generated from long term government contracts for development, production, and service activities. Government contracts typically include the following cost elements: direct material, labor and subcontracting costs, and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative costs. Unless otherwise specified in a contract, costs billed to contracts with the U.S. Government are determined under the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) regulations as allowable and allocable costs. Examples of costs incurred by the company and not billed to the U.S. Government in accordance with the requirements of the FAR and CAS regulations include, but are not limited to, certain legal costs, lobbying costs, charitable donations, and advertising costs. 30 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION The companys long term contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories: Flexibly Priced Contracts Includes both cost type and fixed price incentive contracts. Cost type contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractors allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit. Cost type contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation. Fixed price incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the contractors allowable costs, but are subject to a cost share limit which affects profitability. Fixed price incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed price contracts once the cost share limit is reached. Firm Fixed Price Contracts A firm fixed price contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a pre determined, negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor. The following table summarizes 2006 revenue recognized by contract type and customer: U.S. Other Percent ($ in millions) Government Customers Total of Total Flexibly priced $ 19,415 $ 483 $ 19,898 66 % Firm fixed price 7,604 2,646 10,250 34 Total $ 27,019 $ 3,129 $ 30,148 100 % Contract Fees Negotiated contract fee structures, for both flexibly priced and fixed price contracts may include, but are not limited to: fixed fee amounts, cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance, positive award fees, and negative penalty arrangements. Profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements, percentage of completion of the contract, the achievement of performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined. Positive Award Fees Certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as: cost, schedule, quality, and technical ingenuity. Award fees are determined and earned based on the subjective evaluation by the customer of the companys performance against such negotiated criteria. Award fee contracts are widely used throughout the companys operating segments. Examples of significant long term contracts with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI), F 35 SDD, E 2D SDD, LPD, and DDG 1000 programs. Compliance and Monitoring On a regular basis, the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations. In addition, costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are routinely audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS The companys significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements (see in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. As part of its oversight responsibilities, management evaluates the propriety of its estimates, judgments, and accounting methods as new events occur. Management believes that its policies, judgments, and assessments have been consistently applied in a manner that provides the reader of the companys consolidated financial statements with a fair presentation of information, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP. Management periodically reviews the companys critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors. Principal accounting practices that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity are outlined below. 31 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Revenue Recognition Overview The majority of the companys business is derived from long term contracts for the construction of facilities, production of goods, and services provided to the federal government, which are accounted for under the provisions of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 45 Accounting for Long Term Construction Type Contracts, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No. 81 1 Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, and the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors. The Company classifies contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts. The company also enters into contracts that are not associated with the construction of facilities, production of goods, and services provided to the federal government, such as contracts to provide certain services to non federal government customers. The company accounts for those contracts in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature. The company considers the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when it determines the proper accounting method for a particular contract. Percentage of Completion Accounting The company generally recognizes revenue from its long term contracts under the cost to cost and the units of delivery measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting. The percentage of completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses. For most contracts, sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract. For certain contracts with large up front purchases of material, primarily in the Ships segment, sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs. The units of delivery measure is a modification of the percentage of completion method, which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales value in accordance with the contract terms. The company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit evenly over the life of the contract based on deliveries. The use of the percentage of completion method depends on the ability of the company to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design, manufacture, and delivery of its products and services. Such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years, and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment. Sales under cost type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred. Many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product. These incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred. Incentives and award fees that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentives and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made. Other changes in estimates of contract sales, costs, and profits are recognized using the cumulative catch up method of accounting. This method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods. Hence, the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimates had been the original estimates. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the companys financial position or results of operations. Certain Service Contracts Revenue under contracts to provide services to non federal government customers are generally recognized when services are performed. Service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts, and outsourcing type arrangements, primarily in the Information and Services business. Revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred, except that direct and incremental set up costs 32 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement. Operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the contract. Service contracts that include more than one type of product or service are accounted for under the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00 21 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Accordingly, for applicable arrangements, revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values. Cost Estimation The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the companys engineers, program managers, and financial professionals. Factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the companys financial position or results of operations. Contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances. Cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded to cost of sales in the period the loss is determined. Loss provisions are first offset against costs that are included in inventoried assets, with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities. Purchase Accounting and Goodwill Overview The purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period (typically not exceeding a twelve month period) with the exception of certain adjustments related to income tax uncertainties or restructuring activities, the resolution of which may extend beyond the purchase price allocation period. Acquisition Accruals The company has established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from its acquisitions and divestitures. These accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures. The accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and, in most cases, involve a significant degree of judgment. Management has recorded these accruals in accordance with its interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements, known facts, and an estimation of probable future events based on managements experience and consultation with outside valuation specialists. Goodwill The company evaluates the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually in November, or when evidence of potential impairment exists, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In order to test for potential impairment, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis, corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations, weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and terminal value growth rate assumptions. The WACC takes into account the relative weights of each component of the companys consolidated capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry. The terminal value growth rates are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model. 33 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting units fair value and the relative size of the companys recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the companys impairment analysis. Litigation, Commitments, and Contingencies Overview The company is subject to a range of claims, lawsuits, environmental and income tax matters, and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its internal and external legal counsel. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management, after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter, including any settlement offers, has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known. While the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, resolution of one or more of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on the companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Environmental Accruals The company is subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it conducts operations. The company records an accrual to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Factors which could result in changes to the companys assessment of probability, range of loss, and environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions, increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate, discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated, results of efforts to determine legally responsible parties, changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements, and improvements in remediation technology. Litigation Accruals Litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management, after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter, including any settlement offers, has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known. Tax Contingency Accruals The company records accruals for tax contingencies and related interest when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated based on specific events such as an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority. Changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from pre acquisition years for acquired businesses are charged or credited to goodwill. Adjustments to other tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined. Effective January 1, 2007, the company will measure and record tax contingency accruals in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Retirement Benefits Overview Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the companys pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans are evaluated annually by management in consultation with its outside actuaries. In the event that the company determines that plan amendments or changes in the assumptions are warranted, future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Assumptions The principal assumptions that have a significant effect on the companys financial position and results of operations are the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, and the health care cost trend rates. 34 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Discount Rate The discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations. The discount rate is generally based on the yield on high quality corporate fixed income investments. At the end of each year, the discount rate is primarily determined based on the results of a hypothetical long term bond portfolio matching the expected cash inflows with the expected benefit payments for each benefit plan. Taking into consideration the factors noted above, the companys composite discount rate was 6 percent at December 31, 2006, and 5.75 percent at December 31, 2005. Expected Long Term Rate of Return The expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations. For 2006 and 2005, the company assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.5 percent. Changes in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets within the range indicated below would have had the following impacts on 2006 pension and other postretirement benefits results: .25 Percentage .25 Percentage $ in millions Point Increase Point Decrease (Decrease) Increase Due To Change In Assumptions Used To Determine Net Periodic Benefit Costs For The Year Ended December 31, 2006 Discount rate $ (57 ) $ 86 Expected long term rate of return on plan assets (48 ) 48 (Decrease) Increase Due To Change In Assumptions Used To Determine Benefit Obligations For The Year Ended December 31, 2006 Discount rate $ (731 ) $ 763 Health Care Cost Trend Rates The health care cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation, changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns, technological advances, and changes in the health status of the plan participants. For 2006, the company assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 8.75 percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent. In 2005, the company assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of 10 percent and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent. Differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on 2006 postretirement benefit results: 1 Percentage 1 Percentage $ in millions Point Increase Point Decrease Increase (Decrease) From Change In Health Care Cost Trend Rates Postretirement benefit expense $ 32 $ (26 ) Postretirement benefit liability 101 (109 ) MANAGEMENT FINANCIAL MEASURES The company manages and assesses the performance of its business primarily through the following measures: Contract Acquisitions Contract acquisitions represent orders received during the period for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer. Contract acquisitions tend to fluctuate from year to year and are determined by the size and timing of new and follow on orders. In the year that a business is purchased, its existing funded order backlog as of the purchase date is reported as contract acquisitions. In the year that a business is sold, its existing funded order backlog as of the divestiture date is deducted from contract acquisitions. Sales Year to year sales vary less than contract acquisitions and reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts. For further information related to revenue recognition, refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion included in the Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments section of this Part II, Item 7. 35 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Segment Operating Margin Segment operating margin reflects the performance of segment contracts and programs. Excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance, including the portion of corporate expenses such as management and administration, legal, environmental, certain compensation and retiree benefits, and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable CAS regulations and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and therefore not allocated to the segments. Backlog Funded backlog represents unfilled orders for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer. Unfunded backlog represents firm orders for which funding is not contractually obligated by the customer. Unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) orders. For multi year services contracts with non federal government customers having no stated contract values, backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer. CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS Selected financial highlights are presented in the table below. Year Ended December 31 $ in millions, except per share 2006 2005 2004 Sales and service revenues $ 30,148 $ 30,067 $ 29,000 Operating margin 2,454 2,193 1,986 Interest expense, net 303 334 373 Other, net 125 200 (18 ) Federal and foreign income taxes 709 667 515 (Loss) Gain from discontinued operations (25 ) 8 4 Diluted earnings per share 4.37 3.85 2.97 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,756 2,627 1,936 Sales and Service Revenues 2006 Sales in 2006 increased $81 million as compared with 2005. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues in the Information Technology and Technical Services segments, partially offset by decreased revenues at the Ships segment. Information Technology segment sales increased $260 million due to new business primarily from the Virginia and San Diego County information technology outsourcing contracts and higher sales volume in the United Kingdom Whole Life Support Programme and the Systems and Software Engineering Services program. Technical Services segment revenues increased $256 million primarily due to new business from the Nevada Test Site program. Ships segment sales decreased $465 million due primarily to decreased volume in the DDG 1000 program (formerly known as the DD(X) program) and continued recovery from the impact of Hurricane Katrina (See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8). 2005 Sales in 2005 increased $1.1 billion, or 4 percent, over 2004 due to increased revenue in each of the companys operating segments except Ships, including sales growth of 19 percent at Integrated Systems. The increase at Integrated Systems was due primarily to higher volume in the E 2D Advanced Hawkeye, EA 18G, Unmanned Systems, B 2, and Multi Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP RTIP) programs, partially offset by lower volume in the F/A 18 and Joint STARS programs. Ships segment sales decreased 7 percent in 2005 due primarily to decreased volume in the DDG 1000 and LHD programs and Hurricane Katrina related work delays. 36 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Operating Margin Operating Margin represents segment operating margin (see section entitled Segment Operating Results) adjusted for a number of factors that do not affect the segments as follows: Year Ended December 31 $ in millions 2006 2005 2004 Segment operating margin $ 2,797 $ 2,414 $ 2,292 Unallocated expenses (287 ) (190 ) (282 ) Net pension expense adjustment (37 ) (21 ) (12 ) Reversal of royalty income (19 ) (10 ) (12 ) Total operating margin $ 2,454 $ 2,193 $ 1,986 Unallocated Expenses Unallocated expenses increased $97 million, or 51 percent, in 2006 as compared with 2005. The increase in unallocated expenses is primarily due to a $112.5 million pre tax legal provision recorded in 2006 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8). Unallocated expenses decreased $92 million, or 33 percent, in 2005 as compared with 2004. The decrease was primarily due to lower legal costs in 2005, as the 2004 legal costs included provisions related to the resolution of the Allison Gas Turbine and Robinson litigations. Also included in unallocated expenses is the cost of medical and life benefits to the extent not currently recoverable under CAS. In November 2006, the company adopted plan amendments and communicated to plan participants that it would cap the amount of its contributions to substantially all of its remaining post retirement medical and life benefit plans that were previously not subject to limits on the companys contributions. The change in benefits announced in November 2006 reduced benefit costs by approximately $17 million in 2006. In addition, this change reduced the companys aggregate benefit obligation by approximately $465 million at December 31, 2006. Subsequent to January 1, 2005 (or earlier at some sectors), newly hired employees are not eligible for post employment medical and life benefits. Net Pension Expense Adjustment The net pension expense adjustment reflects the excess pension expense determined in accordance with GAAP over the pension expense allocated to the operating segments under CAS. The net pension expense adjustment increased to $37 million in 2006, as compared with $21 million in 2005, and increased $9 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. Both increases reflect the timing of cost recognition between GAAP and CAS. For 2007, subject to refinements for participant census data and pay as you go plans, management expects the net pension expense adjustment to total approximately $70 million in income primarily due to an increase in the discount rate, voluntary pre funding during 2006, and higher than expected return on plan assets during 2006. The 2007 pension plan assumptions include an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.5 percent and a composite discount rate of 6 percent. Reversal of Royalty Income Royalty income is included in segment operating margin for internal reporting purposes. This amount is reversed in the table above to arrive at operating margin as determined in accordance with GAAP as royalty income is included in the Other, net line item discussed below. Net Interest Expense 2006 Net interest expense decreased $31 million, or 9 percent, in 2006 as compared with 2005.

Sales and Service Revenues 2006 Ships revenue decreased $465 million, or 8 percent, in 2006 as compared with 2005. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume in the DDG 1000 program driven by the transition from Phase III to Phase IV and changes in the Navy acquisition strategy regarding major sub contractors, as well as continued recovery from the impact of Hurricane Katrina in the LPD program. The decrease was partially offset by higher sales in the USS Carl Vinson, DDG 51, WMSL (NSC), and LHA programs. 2005 Ships revenue decreased $466 million, or 7 percent, in 2005, as compared with 2004, partially due to a $158 million reduction of sales from Hurricane Katrina related work delays, an $82 million adjustment of prior sales to account for Hurricane Katrina related cost growth across several Ships programs, and a slow build rate, as a result of property damage following Hurricane Katrina. The decrease also included lower volume in the DDG 1000 program. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales volume in the Virginia class Block II, USS George Washington DPIA, CVN 21, and WMSL (NSC) programs. Segment Operating Margin 2006 Ships operating margin increased $144 million, or 58 percent, in 2006 as compared with 2005. The increase was primarily due to a prior year charge of $150 million to account for Hurricane Katrina related cost growth, as well as a $15 million impact from Hurricane Katrina related work delays (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8). The 2006 operating margin includes a pension benefit resulting from the Pension Protection Act of 2006. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volume in the DDG 1000 program. 2005 Ships operating margin decreased $146 million, or 37 percent, in 2005, as compared with 2004. The decrease included a $150 million charge to account for Hurricane Katrina related cost growth, as well as a $15 million impact from Hurricane Katrina related work delays (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8). This decrease was partially offset by performance improvement on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower program. BACKLOG Total backlog at December 31, 2006, was approximately $61 billion. Total backlog includes both funded backlog (unfilled orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer). Unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded IDIQ orders. For multi year services contracts with non federal government customers having no stated contract values, backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer. Major components in unfunded backlog as of December 31, 2006, included various restricted programs, the Kinetic Energy Interceptors program in the Mission Systems segment; the F 35, F/A 18, and E 2 Advanced Hawkeye programs in the Integrated Systems segment; the NPOESS program in the Space Technology segment; and Block II of the Virginia Class submarines program and the Vinson execution contract in the Ships segment. 46 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION The following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment at December 31, 2006 and 2005: 2006 2005 Total Total $ in millions Funded Unfunded Backlog Funded Unfunded Backlog Information & Services Mission Systems $ 2,952 $ 8,337 $ 11,289 $ 2,309 $ 7,614 $ 9,923 Information Technology 2,830 2,537 5,367 2,244 2,926 5,170 Technical Services 1,066 3,276 4,342 567 861 1,428 Aerospace Integrated Systems 4,285 4,934 9,219 3,678 8,524 12,202 Space Technology 1,936 7,289 9,225 972 6,807 7,779 Electronics 6,585 1,583 8,168 5,996 1,971 7,967 Ships 10,854 2,566 13,420 6,130 5,379 11,509 Other 5 5 Total backlog $ 30,508 $ 30,522 $ 61,030 $ 21,901 $ 34,082 $ 55,983 Backlog is converted into the following years sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made. Approximately 65 percent of the 2006 year end funded backlog is expected to be converted into sales in 2007. Total U.S. Government orders, including those made on behalf of foreign governments, comprised 90 percent, 83 percent, and 86 percent of the funded backlog at the end of 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Total foreign customer orders accounted for 5 percent, 10 percent, and 9 percent of the funded backlog at the end of 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Domestic commercial backlog represented 5 percent, 7 percent, and 5 percent of funded backlog at the end of 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Contractual Obligations The following table presents the companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006, and the estimated timing of future cash payments: 2008 2010 2012 and $ in millions Total 2007 2009 2011 beyond Long term debt $ 4,016 $ 75 $ 575 $ 855 $ 2,511 Interest payments on long term debt 4,068 293 570 460 2,745 Mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock 699 24 49 49 577 Operating leases 1,920 420 600 357 543 Purchase obligations(1) 5,637 4,127 1,335 152 23 Other long term liabilities(2) 997 185 231 150 431 Total contractual obligations $ 17,337 $ 5,124 $ 3,360 $ 2,023 $ 6,830 (1) A purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. These amounts are primarily comprised of open purchase order commitments to vendors and subcontractors pertaining to funded contracts. (2) Other long term liabilities primarily consist of accrued workers compensation, deferred compensation, and other miscellaneous liabilities. The table above also excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retiree benefit plans as set forth by ERISA in relation to the $3.4 billion pension and postretirement benefit liability, totaling approximately 47 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION $2.0 billion over the next five years: $372 million in 2007, $622 million in 2008 and 2009, and $991 million in 2010 and 2011. The company also has payments due under plans that are not required to be funded in advance, but are funded on a pay as you go basis. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Further details regarding long term debt and operating leases can be found in Notes 13 and 16, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Sources and Uses of Cash The following table provides an overview of the companys sources and uses of cash. The amounts from which the percentages are derived are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows: cash from customers and cash to employees and suppliers of services and materials are reported in Operating Activities; cash from buyers of assets, cash to sellers of assets, and cash to suppliers of facilities are reported in Investing Activities; and cash from and cash to lenders and shareholders are reported in Financing Activities. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Cash came from Customers 96 % 97 % 94 % Buyers of assets/other 2 2 1 Shareholders 1 1 3 Lenders 1 2 100 % 100 % 100 % Cash went to Suppliers and employees 86 % 88 % 87 % Lenders 5 1 4 Shareholders 4 5 4 Sellers of assets 3 4 2 Suppliers of facilities/other 2 2 3 100 % 100 % 100 % Operating Activities 2006 In 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion as compared with $2.6 billion in 2005. The decrease was primarily due to contributions to the companys pension plans totaling $1.2 billion, of which $800 million was voluntarily pre funded in the fourth quarter, as compared to contributions of $415 million in 2005, of which $203 million was voluntarily pre funded in the fourth quarter. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act) was enacted into law. While the impact of the Act is still being evaluated, the company does not expect it to have any significant effect on its current funding strategy for its U.S. pension plans. Cash collected from customers decreased by $231 million, and cash paid to suppliers and employees increased by $302 million. Net cash from operating activities for 2006 included the receipt of $100 million of insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Katrina, $60 million of federal and state income tax refunds, and $45 million of interest. At December 31, 2006, net working capital deficit (current assets less current liabilities) was $34 million, primarily reflecting a lower cash balance offset by a lower current portion of long term debt. 2005 In 2005, cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion as compared with $1.9 billion in 2004. The increase was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments. Cash collected from customers increased by $1.5 billion, and cash paid to suppliers and employees increased by $1.2 billion. Net cash from operating activities for 2005 included the receipt of $89 million of insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Katrina, $88 million of federal and state income tax refunds, and $78 million of interest, including 48 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION interest on a state tax refund for research and development credits for the years 1988 through 1990. These cash inflows were offset by a payment of $99 million for a litigation settlement. Employer contributions to the companys pension plans were $415 million in 2005 as compared with $624 million in 2004. The contributions include voluntary pre funding payments of $203 million and $250 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest payments decreased $39 million in 2005 as compared with 2004, due to further reduction in fixed rate debt. At December 31, 2005, net working capital deficit (current assets less current liabilities) was $423 million, primarily driven by an increased current portion of long term debt. 2004 In 2004, cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion as compared with $798 million in 2003. In 2003, cash used in operations included $1 billion of taxes paid upon completion of the B 2 EMD contract. In 2004, the companys appeal to the Supreme Court of Indiana in connection with the Allison Gas Turbine case was denied and the company paid $81 million in settlement of the judgment and interest. In 2004, the company and Goodrich agreed to a settlement to resolve certain post closing liabilities that related to warranty, customer claims, and certain other matters in exchange for a payment to Goodrich of $99 million. The company also resolved an indemnification of other post employment benefits, pursuant to the TRW Auto sale agreement, and paid an affiliate of The Blackstone Group $52.5 million. Employer contributions to the companys pension plans increased $295 million from $329 million in 2003 to $624 million in 2004. The increase reflects a voluntary pre funding of $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. No such pre funding payment was made in 2003. Interest payments decreased $150 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily due to a reduction in fixed rate debt. Investing Activities 2006 Cash used in investing activities was $601 million in 2006. During 2006, the company received $209 million from the sale of the remaining 9.7 million of its TRW Auto common shares. Also during 2006, Ship Systems received access to $200 million from the issuance of Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds (see discussion in Financing Activities below) of which $127 million remained restricted as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the company received $117 million of insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Katrina, paid $77 million for set up costs in relation to initiation of outsourcing contracts, and paid $35 million for the purchase of an investment. During 2006, the company also received $43 million from the sales of Interconnect and Winchester. Capital expenditures in 2006 were $737 million, including $111 million to replace property damaged by Hurricane Katrina and $36 million of capitalized software costs. Capital expenditure commitments at December 31, 2006 were approximately $443 million, which are expected to be paid with cash on hand and restricted cash. 2005 Cash used in investing activities was $855 million in 2005. During 2005, the company paid $361 million to acquire two businesses. This includes the acquisition of Confluent in September 2005 and Integic in March 2005. The company received $238 million from the sale of investments, including $95 million for 3.4 million common shares of Endwave and $143 million for 7.3 million common shares of TRW Auto. During 2005, the company also received $57 million from the sale of Teldix. The company received insurance proceeds of $38 million in 2005 to replace damaged property at the Ships segment as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Capital expenditures in 2005 were $824 million, including $80 million to replace property damaged by Hurricane Katrina and $41 million of capitalized software costs. 49 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION 2004 Cash provided by investing activities was $9 million in 2004. On November 12, 2004, the company received $493.5 million, from the repurchase of the TRW Auto payment in kind note, which was net of $40.5 million for settlement of certain contractual issues arising from the sale of TRW Auto. During 2004, the company received $125 million from the sale of businesses including Kester, one of the former Components Technologies businesses, in February 2004 for approximately $60 million, and Northrop Grumman Canada in December 2004 for approximately $65 million. Capital expenditures in 2004 were $672 million, including $53 million for capitalized software costs. Financing Activities 2006 Cash used in financing activities in 2006 was $1.7 billion comprised primarily of $1.2 billion in repayments of long term debt, $825 million in share repurchases, and $402 million of dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by $393 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options and $200 million of debt incurred in relation to the Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds. In March 2006, the company repaid a $400 million 7.0 percent debenture at maturity and a $35 million 7.625 percent debenture at maturity. In May 2006, the company repaid an $85 million 8.75 percent debenture at maturity. In November 2006, the company repaid a $690 million 4.08 percent senior note at maturity. Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds In December 2006, Ship Systems entered into a loan agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation (MBFC) under which Ship Systems received access to $200 million from the issuance of Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds by the MBFC. The loan accrues interest payable semi annually at a fixed rate of 4.55 percent per annum. The bonds are subject to redemption at the companys discretion on or after December 1, 2016, and mature on December 1, 2028. The bonds will be repaid by Ship Systems in accordance with the terms stipulated in the loan agreement. The bond issuance proceeds must be used to finance the construction, reconstruction, and renovation of the companys interest in certain ship manufacturing and repair facilities, or portions thereof, located in the state of Mississippi. As of December 31, 2006, $73 million was used by Ship Systems and the remaining $127 million was recorded in miscellaneous other assets as restricted cash in the consolidated statements of financial position in Part II, Item 8. Repayment of the bonds is guaranteed by the company. Share Repurchases On October 24, 2005, the companys board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion of its outstanding common stock, which commenced in November 2005 and under which $176 million is remaining. Under this program, the company entered into an initial agreement with Credit Suisse, New York Branch (Credit Suisse) on November 4, 2005, to repurchase approximately 9.1 million shares of common stock at an initial price of $55.15 per share for a total of $500 million. Credit Suisse immediately borrowed shares that were sold to and canceled by the company. Subsequently, Credit Suisse purchased shares in the open market to settle its share borrowings. On March 1, 2006, Credit Suisse completed its purchases under this agreement, and the company paid $37 million for the final price adjustment under the terms of the agreement. The final average purchase price was $59.05 per share. The company entered into a second agreement with Credit Suisse on March 6, 2006, to repurchase approximately 11.6 million shares of common stock at an initial price of $64.78 per share for a total of $750 million. Under this agreement, Credit Suisse immediately borrowed shares that were sold to and canceled by the company. Subsequently, Credit Suisse purchased shares in the open market to settle its share borrowings. On May 26, 2006, Credit Suisse completed its purchases under this agreement, and the company paid $37 million for the final price adjustment under the terms of the agreement. The final average purchase price was $68.01 per share. On December 14, 2006, the companys board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion of its outstanding common stock. This new authorization is in addition to $176 million remaining 50 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION on the companys previous share repurchase authorization for a total of $1.176 billion authorized for share repurchases. Share repurchases take place at managements discretion and under pre established non discretionary programs from time to time, depending on market conditions, in the open market, and in privately negotiated transactions. The company retires its common stock upon repurchase and has not made any purchases of common stock other than in connection with these publicly announced repurchase programs. 2005 Cash used in financing activities in 2005 was $1.4 billion comprised primarily of $1.2 billion in share repurchases and $359 million in dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by $163 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options. 2004 Cash of $1 billion was used in financing activities in 2004, comprised primarily of $786 million in share repurchases, $725 million in principal payments of long term debt, and $322 million in dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by $834 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options. Debt Reduction On October 15, 2004, the company redeemed all of its outstanding $250 million 9.375 percent debentures due 2024. The redemption price was 104.363 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date. As a result of the redemption, the company recorded a $13 million pre tax charge in 2004. Also, on October 15, 2004, $350 million of 8.625 percent notes matured. Equity Security Units In November 2001, the company issued 6.9 million equity security units. Each equity security unit, issued at $100 per unit, initially consisted of a contract to purchase shares of Northrop Grumman common stock on November 16, 2004, and a $100 senior note due 2006. The senior notes due 2006 were reported as long term debt in 2005. The senior notes initially bore interest at 5.25 percent per annum, and each equity security unit paid a contract adjustment payment of 2.0 percent per annum through November 16, 2004, for a combined yield on the equity security unit of 7.25 percent per annum through November 16, 2004. On August 11, 2004, the company remarketed the senior notes as required by the original terms of the equity security units. As a result of this remarketing, the interest rate on the senior notes was reset to 4.08 percent per annum effective August 16, 2004. Proceeds from the remarketed notes were used to purchase U.S. Treasury securities that were pledged to secure the stock purchase obligations of the unit holders and held with a collateral agent. The notes were repaid on November 16, 2006. On November 16, 2004, the company received $690 million and issued 13.2 million shares of common stock in settlement of the stock purchase contracts. The number of shares issued was calculated using a conversion ratio of 1.9171 shares per each equity security unit, which was determined in accordance with the original terms of the stock purchase contracts. Credit Facility On August 5, 2005, the company entered into a new credit agreement which provides for a five year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2 billion. The credit facility permits the company to request additional lending commitments from the lenders under the agreement or other eligible lenders under certain circumstances, and thereby to increase the aggregate principal amount of the lending commitments under the agreement by up to an additional $500 million. The agreement provides for swingline loans and letters of credit as sub facilities for the credit facilities provided for in the agreement. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at various rates, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), adjusted based on the companys credit rating, or an alternate base rate plus an incremental margin. The credit facility also requires a facility fee based on the daily aggregate amount of commitments (whether or not utilized) and the companys credit rating level. The companys credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that are less restrictive than those contained in the prior credit agreement. At December 31, 2006, and 2005, there was no balance outstanding under this facility and there were no borrowings under this facility at any time during 2006 or 2005. Concurrent with the effectiveness of the new credit agreement, the 2001 credit agreement, for $2.5 billion, terminated on August 5, 2005. No principal or interest was outstanding or accrued and unpaid under the 2001 51 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION credit agreement on that date. During 2004, the company borrowed $100 million under this facility for a period of 27 days. Mandatorily Redeemable Series B Convertible Preferred Stock In connection with the Litton acquisition, the company issued 3.5 million shares of mandatorily redeemable Series B convertible preferred stock in April 2001. Each share of Series B preferred stock has a liquidation value of $100 per share. The liquidation value, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, is payable on April 4, 2021, the mandatory redemption date. The company has the option to redeem all, but not less than all, of the shares of Series B preferred stock at any time after seven years from the date of issuance for a number of shares of the companys common stock equal to the liquidation value plus accrued and unpaid dividends divided by the current market price of common stock determined in relation to the date of redemption. Under this option, had the redemption taken place at December 31, 2006, each share would have been converted into 1.494 shares of common stock. Each share of preferred stock is convertible, at any time, at the option of the holder into the right to receive shares of the companys common stock. Initially, each share was convertible into .911 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment in the event of certain dividends and distributions, a stock split, a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of the companys assets, a liquidation or distribution, and certain other events. Had the conversion taken place at December 31, 2006, each share would have been converted into 1.822 shares of common stock. Holders of preferred stock are entitled to cumulative annual cash dividends of $7 per share, payable quarterly. In any liquidation of the company, each share of preferred stock is entitled to a liquidation preference before any distribution may be made on the companys common stock or any series of capital stock that is junior to the Series B preferred stock. In the event of a change in control of the company, holders of Series B preferred stock also have specified exchange rights into common stock of the company or into specified securities or property of another entity participating in the change in control transaction. As of December 31, 2006, 10 million shares of preferred stock are authorized, of which 3.5 million shares designated as Series B preferred are issued and outstanding. Other Sources and Uses of Capital Additional Capital To provide for long term liquidity, the company believes it can obtain additional capital, if necessary, from such sources as the public or private capital markets, the sale of assets, sale and leaseback of operating assets, and leasing rather than purchasing new assets. Cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus cash generated from operations and cash available under credit lines are expected to be sufficient in 2007 to service debt, finance capital expansion projects, pay federal income taxes, and continue paying dividends to shareholders. The company will continue to provide the productive capacity to perform its existing contracts, prepare for future contracts, and conduct research and development in the pursuit of developing opportunities. While these expenditures tend to limit short term liquidity, they are made with the intention of improving the long term growth and profitability of the company. Financial Arrangements In the ordinary course of business, the company uses standby letters of credit and guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by insurance companies principally to guarantee the performance on certain contracts and to support the companys self insured workers compensation plans. At December 31, 2006, there were $460 million of unused stand by letters of credit, $152 million of bank guarantees, and $615 million of surety bonds outstanding. Co Operative Agreements In 2003, Ships executed agreements with the states of Mississippi and Louisiana whereby Ships leases facility improvements and equipment from Mississippi and from a non profit economic development corporation in Louisiana in exchange for certain commitments by Ships to these states. As of December 31, 2006, Ships has met its obligations under the Mississippi agreement and remains obligated under the Louisiana agreement to maintain a minimum average of 5,200 full time employees at the end of any four year period occurring between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2010, upon assembly and installation of certain equipment. 52 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION Failure by Ships to meet the Louisiana commitment would result in reimbursement by Ships to Louisiana in accordance with the agreement. As of December 31, 2006, Ships expects that all future commitments under the Louisiana agreement will be met based on its most recent business plan. OTHER MATTERS New Accounting Pronouncements New accounting pronouncements have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board which are not effective until after December 31, 2006. For further discussion of new accounting standards, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, the company had no significant off balance sheet arrangements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rates The company is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed rate long term debt obligations, variable rate short term debt outstanding under the credit agreement, short term investments, and long term notes receivable. At December 31, 2006, substantially all borrowings were fixed rate long term debt obligations of which a significant portion are not callable until maturity. The companys sensitivity to a 1 percent change in interest rates is tied to its $2 billion credit agreement, which had no balance outstanding at December 31, 2006, or 2005. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Derivatives The company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, and 2005, two interest rate swap agreements were in effect. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Foreign Currency The company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2006, and 2005, the amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was not material. The company does not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign currency exchange to be material to the consolidated financial statements. 53 Table of Contents NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION
