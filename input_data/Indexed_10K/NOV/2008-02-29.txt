ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General Overview The Company is a leading worldwide provider of highly engineered drilling and well servicing equipment, products and services to the exploration and production segments of the oil and gas industry. With operations in approximately 700 locations across six continents, we design, manufacture and service a comprehensive line of drilling and well servicing equipment; sell and rent drilling motors, specialized downhole tools, and rig instrumentation; perform inspection and internal coating of oilfield tubular products; provide drill cuttings separation, management and disposal systems and services; provide expendables and spare parts used in conjunction with our large installed base of equipment; and provide supply chain management services through our distribution network. We also manufacture coiled tubing, provide in service pipeline inspections, manufacture high pressure fiberglass and composite tubing, and sell and rent advanced in line inspection equipment to makers of oil country tubular goods. We have a long tradition of pioneering innovations which improve the cost effectiveness, efficiency, safety, and environmental impact of oil and gas operations. Our revenues and operating results are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling and production activities and the profitability and cash flow of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, which in turn are affected by current and anticipated prices of oil and gas. Oil and gas prices have been and are likely to continue to be volatile. See Risk Factors. We conduct our operations through three business segments: Rig Technology, Petroleum Services Supplies and Distribution Services. See Item 1. Business for a discussion of each of these business segments. Operating Environment Overview Our results are dependent on, among other things, the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling, well remediation activity, the price of crude oil and natural gas, capital spending by other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors, pipeline maintenance activity, and the worldwide oil and gas inventory levels. Key industry indicators for the past three years include the following: % % 2007 vs. 2007 vs. 2007* 2006* 2005* 2006 2005 Active Drilling Rigs: U.S. 1,767 1,648 1,381 7.2 % 28.0 % Canada 344 470 458 (26.8 %) (24.9 %) International 1,005 925 908 8.6 % 10.7 % Worldwide 3,116 3,043 2,747 2.4 % 13.4 % West Texas Intermediate $ 72.33 $ 66.00 $ 56.65 9.6 % 27.7 % Crude Prices (per barrel) Natural Gas Prices ($/mmbtu) $ 6.97 $ 6.74 $ 8.83 3.4 % (21.1 %) * Averages for the years indicated. See sources below. 33 Table of Contents The following table details the U.S., Canadian, and international rig activity and West Texas Intermediate Oil prices for the three years ended December 31, 2007 on a quarterly basis: Source: Rig count: Baker Hughes, Inc. (www.bakerhughes.com); West Texas Intermediate Crude Price: Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (www.eia.doe.gov). Natural gas prices increased slightly in 2007 in comparison to 2006, and oil prices generally increased throughout 2007. The average price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate Crude reached historic heights in 2007, peaking at just over $99 in November. The 2007 average price for the year was the highest ever annual average oil price at $72.33 per barrel, an increase of 9.6% over the average price for 2006. Natural gas prices were $6.97 per mmbtu, an increase of 3.4% compared to the 2006 average. Higher oil prices led to stronger rig activity worldwide, increasing 2.4% for the full year in 2007 compared to 2006. At February 15, 2008, there were 1,773 rigs actively drilling in the U.S., compared to 1,782 rigs at December 28, 2007. The company believes that most current industry projections are forecasting commodity prices to remain strong, and, as a result, U.S. and international drilling rig activity is expected to continue at a high level. However, numerous events could significantly alter these projections including political tensions in the Middle East, the acceleration or deceleration of the recovery of the U.S. and world economies, a build up in the world inventory levels, or numerous other events or circumstances. 34 Table of Contents Executive Summary National Oilwell Varco generated earnings of $1,337.1 million or $3.76 per fully diluted share in its fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, on revenues of $9,789.0 million. Earnings per share increased 95 percent and revenue increased 39 percent from the Companys 2006 earnings and revenues, respectively, as we experienced rising demand for our products and services through the year. Our backlog for capital equipment increased 50 percent throughout the year, despite steadily rising shipments out of backlog, due principally to growing numbers of new offshore drilling rig construction projects initiated during 2007 which placed orders with the Company. Oil Gas Equipment and Services Market Oil and gas prices have increased significantly over the past five years and remain near historic highs, which have led to high levels of exploration and development drilling in many oil and gas basins around the globe. The count of rigs actively drilling during 2007 as measured by Baker Hughes (a good measure of the level of oilfield activity and spending) increased 2.4 percent from 2006, representing the fifth straight year of increasing average annual rig count. Year to year growth in domestic, Latin American and Eastern Hemisphere drilling activity was partly offset by Canadian activity declines. Activity in the U.S. and the Eastern Hemisphere grew modestly throughout the year, while Canada declined sharply during the second quarter, as it typically does, and remained weak throughout the second half of 2007. Latin American drilling activity was essentially flat throughout the year. The level of drilling activity underway is the highest seen since the early 1980s, which is fueling high demand for oilfield services. Much of the new incremental drilling activity is occurring in harsh environments, and employs increasingly sophisticated technology to find and produce reserves. Higher utilization of drilling rigs has tested the capability of the worlds fleet of rigs, much of which is old and of limited capability. Technology has advanced significantly since most of the existing rig fleet was built. The industry invested little during the late 1980s and 1990s on new drilling equipment, but drilling technology progressed steadily nonetheless, as the Company and its competitors continued to invest in new and better ways of drilling. As a consequence, the safety, reliability, and efficiency of new, modern rigs surpass the performance of most of the older rigs at work today. The rise in demand for drilling rigs has driven rig dayrates higher over the past few years, which has increased cash flows and available financing to drilling contractors. Many have invested in new rigs or placed older rigs back into service. The Company has played an important role in providing both new rigs as well as the equipment, consumables and services needed to reactivate many older rigs. Oil and gas producers demand top performance from drilling rigs, particularly at the premium dayrates that are being paid today. As a result of this trend, the Company has benefited from incremental demand for new products (such as our small iron roughnecks for land rigs, our LXT BOPs, our Safe T Lite pump liner systems, among others) to upgrade certain rig functions to make them safer and more efficient. Drilling rigs are now being pushed to drill deeper wells, more complex wells, highly deviated wells and horizontal wells; tasks which require larger rigs with more capabilities. Higher dayrates magnify the opportunity cost of rig downtime, and rigs are being pushed to maximize revenue days for their drilling contractor owners. The drilling process effectively consumes the mechanical components of a rig, which wear out and need periodic repair or replacement. This process has been accelerated by very high rig utilization and wellbore complexity. Drilling consumes rigs; more complex and challenging drilling consumes rigs faster. Changing methods of drilling have further benefited the Companys business. Increasingly, hydraulic power in addition to conventional mechanical rotary power is being used to apply torque to the drill bit. This is done using downhole drilling motors powered by drilling fluids. We are a major provider of downhole drilling motors, and we have seen demand for this application of our drilling motors increase over the last few years. This trend has also increased demand for our high pressure mud pumps, which create the hydraulic power in the drilling fluid which drive the drilling motors. While the increasingly efficient equipment provided by us has mitigated the effect, high activity levels have increased demand for personnel in the oilfield. Consequently, the Company, its customers and its suppliers have experienced wage inflation in certain markets. Hiring experienced drilling crews has been challenging for the drilling industry; however, we believe crews generally prefer working on newer, more modern rigs. Our products which save labor and increase efficiency (such as its automatic slips and pipe handling equipment) also make the rig crews jobs safer and easier, and make the rig a more desirable place to work. The world is actively building nearly 170 new offshore rigs, and schedules call for 27 new drillships, 45 new semisubmersibles, and 80 new jackup rigs to be delivered into the fleet by the end of 2011. The 628 offshore rig fleet they will join is old; the average age is approximately 25 years. The existing fleet was engineered and constructed prior to many technical advancements, 35 Table of Contents and we believe that the newer rigs offer considerably higher efficiency, safety, and capability, and that many will effectively replace a portion of the existing fleet. Additionally, the large number of floating rig construction projects will add new capacity required to press exploration into new deepwater frontiers. Land rig construction is strong, and new orders brisk, with most interest directed towards international markets where customers are adopting newer rig technologies. Our domestic land rig backlog has fallen by about half from peak 2006 levels due to lower dayrates in the U.S. as compared to early 2007; however, newer, better rigs are consistently posting meaningfully higher dayrates and utilization than older rigs in the domestic market. We believe the retooling of the U.S. land rig market will continue as favorable operator experience with higher technology rigs will continue to pull more of these into the marketplace. Overall we expect to continue to sell into three important trends in the rig fleet worldwide: the secular buildout of additional deepwater capabilities, the retooling of the jackup fleet with newer, more capable rigs, and the replacement of older land rigs with improved technology. Segment Performance Revenues for the Rig Technology group in 2007 were $5,744.7 million, up 60 percent from 2006 group revenues of $3,584.9 million. Operating profit was $1,393.6 million or 24.3 percent of revenue in 2007, compared to $608.5 million or 17.0 percent of sales in 2006. Operating profit flow through or leverage (the period to period increase in operating profit divided by the increase in revenue) was 36 percent from 2006 to 2007. The 2007 results benefited from higher new rig construction volumes, higher sales of aftermarket goods and services, rising manufacturing efficiencies and improving pricing, partly offset by higher employee and material costs. The Companys Rig Technology group reported a backlog of capital equipment orders totaling $9,003.5 million at December 31, 2007, up 50 percent from December 31, 2006. The group was awarded $7,080.1 million in new capital equipment orders in 2007, an increase of 18 percent over orders won in 2006. Fourth quarter 2007 orders of $2,192.1 million were the largest quarterly order level ever achieved by the group, and year ending backlog achieved record levels as well. The Company has the capability to supply up to $50 million of equipment for a jackup rig, more than $250 million of equipment for a new floating rig, and effectively all of a new land rig (which can range in price from less than $1 million for a well service rig to over $50 million for a large harsh environment rig). Backlog for drilling equipment at December 31, 2007 was approximately 85 percent offshore and 15 percent land rig equipment. The delivery of this equipment is typically tied to the construction schedule of the rig, which can take as long as four years to complete. While substantially all of the current backlog will be delivered by the end of 2009, a portion extends out as far as 2011. Approximately 88 percent of the drilling equipment in backlog is destined for international markets. The Companys Rig Technology group manufacturing base relies on a combination of internal and external capabilities, and we have significantly increased the output of our manufacturing plants in response to the high demand. This has been accomplished by optimizing the manufacturing infrastructure between Varco and National Oilwell to enhance efficiency following the March 2005 merger, the rollout of Quick Response Manufacturing (QRM) and lean manufacturing techniques across a number of facilities, and a 37 percent increase in capital expenditures in the group as compared to 2006. We are also providing our vendors with longer range forecasts to assist their planning, placing longer term orders to match our backlog, and qualifying new suppliers throughout North America, Europe and Asia. The Companys Petroleum Services Supplies generated $3,061.0 million in revenue in 2007, an increase of 26 percent from 2006 revenues of $2,425.0 million, due to rising demand for oilfield goods and services the group provides, the impact of acquisitions, and several international expansion initiatives launched by the group including new facilities opened in the Middle East and Far East. Additionally the group benefited from investments made in its coiled tubing and composite pipe manufacturing infrastructure last year. The groups operating profit for the year was $731.6 million or 23.9 percent of sales, an increase from 2006 operating profit of $545.6 million or 22.5 percent of sales. The group generated 29 percent operating profit flow through from 2006 to 2007. Margins for the Petroleum Services Supplies group improved in 2007 as a result of the higher volumes and better pricing, offset by higher personnel and materials costs. The strong results were broad based, with all major product and service lines up year over year. Domestic and international revenues continued to grow throughout the year; however, results in Canada softened on a seasonally adjusted basis as many of our customers in Canada reduced activity in response to lower gas prices, a stronger Canadian dollar, and higher royalty expenses in Alberta. The groups mix of non North American revenue rose steadily throughout the year, from 38 percent in the first quarter to 43 percent in the fourth quarter, as overseas business grew. The flattening of the rig count in the U.S., and the declining level of activity in Canada compared to the prior year, reduced overall pricing leverage in North America; however, pricing trends remain very regional and product line specific, with pricing of certain products continuing to increase. 36 Table of Contents The Companys Distribution Services group generated revenues of $1,423.7 million in 2007, a four percent increase from 2006 revenues of $1,369.6 million. Operating profit was $94.0 million, unchanged from the prior year. Operating margins were 6.6 percent, down slightly from 2006 operating margins of 6.9 percent. The group generated no incremental operating profit flow through in 2007, due mostly to a sharp decline in business in its Canadian operations. Revenue growth in overseas markets fully offset lower Canadian sales, but startup costs in several new international locations led to lower flow throughs from these areas. Domestic operations posted good year over year growth at strong flow throughs, but the business began to experience increasing domestic price pressure through the second half of 2007. Strategic alliance agreements with new customers fueled much of the Distribution Services groups international growth. Once in place the strategic alliances provide the group a stable platform of business around which it can open new locations at lower risk and cost. The group has expanded around the world by following our customers rigs into new regions. The group is also selling more MRO supplies internally to legacy Varco organizations, which increased our leverage through greater purchase volumes. Outlook We believe that the outlook for the Company for 2008 remains positive, as historically high commodity prices are expected to keep overall oil and gas activity high, and as the Company enters 2008 with a record level of backlog for capital equipment for its Rig Technology group. Oil prices and supply remain subject to significant political risk in many international regions. The growth of China and other emerging economies has added significant demand to the oil markets, and new sources of supply continue to prove challenging to find and produce economically. The Company expects the high oil prices that have resulted to sustain high levels of oilfield activity in 2008, provided the worlds major economies remain strong, and OPEC discipline keeps oil prices high. High commodity prices, drilling activity levels, and drilling rig dayrates are expected to continue to fuel demand for the Companys Rig Technology group. The supply of offshore rigs remains tight in many markets, and quotation activity for the Rig Technology group remains brisk. In particular, the Company expects recent deepwater lease awards and announcements of discoveries in Brazil to continue to fuel a high level of interest in floating drilling rig construction projects. Additionally, interest in new international land rigs remains very high, while domestic rig demand has stabilized. Our outlook for the Companys Petroleum Services Supplies segment remains good, given continuation of high levels of drilling across the U.S., Middle East, North Africa, the Far East, Latin America and the North Sea. While Canadian activity remains slow, we believe the long term outlook there is good given the difficulties the industry has faced in meaningfully growing gas production across North America. Gas production from resource plays (coal bed methane, tight sands and shales) has increased to about 40 percent of total U.S. gas production, and is believed to exhibit higher decline rates than conventional reservoirs. The Companys Distribution Services segment operates in very competitive markets, but we are targeting further international expansion underpinned by new strategic alliances in 2008 to fuel additional growth. The business also continues to be challenged by weak demand in Canada. 37 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 The following table summarizes the Companys revenue and operating profit by operating segment in 2007 and 2006 (in millions): Years Ended December 31, Variance 2007 2006 $ % Revenue: Rig Technology $ 5,744.7 $ 3,584.9 $ 2,159.8 60.2 % Petroleum Services Supplies 3,061.0 2,425.0 636.0 26.2 % Distribution Services 1,423.7 1,369.6 54.1 4.0 % Eliminations (440.4 ) (353.7 ) (86.7 ) 24.5 % Total Revenue $ 9,789.0 $ 7,025.8 $ 2,763.2 39.3 % Operating Profit: Rig Technology $ 1,393.6 $ 608.5 $ 785.1 129.0 % Petroleum Services Supplies 731.6 545.6 186.0 34.1 % Distribution Services 94.0 94.0 Unallocated expenses and eliminations (174.8 ) (137.0 ) (37.8 ) 27.6 % Total Operating Profit $ 2,044.4 $ 1,111.1 $ 933.3 84.0 % Operating Profit %: Rig Technology 24.3 % 17.0 % Petroleum Services Supplies 23.9 % 22.5 % Distribution Services 6.6 % 6.9 % Total Operating Profit % 20.9 % 15.8 % Rig Technology Rig Technology revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $5,744.7 million, an increase of $2,159.8 million (60.2%) compared to 2006. The increase is due to the growing market for capital equipment, as evidenced by backlog growth, price increases implemented in 2006, and increases in spare parts and service revenue. The increase in orders and backlog resulted from increased rig construction projects and higher capital investment by drilling contractors in 2007 as compared to 2006. Operating profit from Rig Technology was $1,393.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $785.1 million (129.0%) over the same period of 2006. The increase in operating profit was largely due to the increased activity and pricing discussed above. The Rig Technology group monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when we receive a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $9.0 billion at December 31, 2007, an increase of $3.0 billion (50.0%) over backlog of $6.0 billion at December 31, 2006. Substantially all of the current backlog will be delivered by the end of 2009. Petroleum Services Supplies Revenue from Petroleum Services Supplies was $3,061.0 million for 2007 compared to $2,425.0 million for 2006, an increase of $636.0 million (26.2%). The increase was attributable to the higher demand for all products and services offered by the segment. Downhole tools sales and rentals, drill pipe coating services, and inspection equipment sales achieved revenue increases ranging from 40% to 72%. Operating profit from Petroleum Services Supplies was $731.6 million for 2007 compared to $545.6 million for 2006, an increase of $186.0 million (34.1%). The increase was attributable to higher profitability across virtually all product lines, driven 38 Table of Contents by higher volumes discussed above. Operating profit dollar increases ranging from 48% to 144% were achieved from downhole tool sales and rentals, drill pipe coating services and pipeline inspections. Distribution Services Revenue from Distribution Services totaled $1,423.7 million, an increase of $54.1 million (4.0%) from the prior period. The number of drilling rigs actively searching for oil and gas is a key metric for this business segment. Worldwide rig count increased 2.4% in 2007 compared to 2006, with increases of 7.2% and 8.6% in the U.S. and international rig activity, offset almost entirely by a 26.8% decline in Canada rig activity. The Companys Distribution Services segment efforts to expand in international markets along with the increasing international market activity resulted in a 22% increase in international revenue. The international revenue growth over the prior period reflects additional large contract awards, the extension of US based contracts into the international arena, increased volume from our global alliance customers and increased export activity. Operating income remained the same in 2007 at $94.0 million while margins decreased slightly to 6.6% of revenue in 2007 compared to 6.9% of revenue in 2006. The decrease in margin was primarily due to weak demand in Canada and resulting lower operating profit in Canada. Unallocated expenses and eliminations Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $174.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $137.0 million for 2006. The increase in operations costs was primarily due to greater inter segment profit eliminations, an increase in employee compensation expense and greater stock based compensation expense. The stock based compensation expense was $43.1 million and $31.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2006 results also included $7.9 million of integration costs related to the 2005 merger with Varco. Interest and financial costs Interest and financial costs were $50.3 million for 2007 compared to $48.7 million for 2006. The increase was primarily due to unfavorable interest rate movements on the Companys outstanding interest rate swap agreements. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net was an expense of $17.8 million and $31.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The decrease in expense was primarily due to a net foreign exchange loss which was $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The 2007 foreign exchange losses were primarily due to the strengthening in Norwegian Kroner, British Pound Sterling, and Euro currencies compared to the U.S. Dollar. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Rates. Provision for income taxes The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 33.3% compared to 33.9% for 2006. The lower 2007 tax rate was due primarily to a higher percentage of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates, favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions associated with prior years and increased tax benefits in the US from manufacturing activities. These benefits were partially offset by increased state income tax in the US from the new Texas Margins tax, incremental US tax on repatriated foreign earnings and the loss of tax benefits in the US associated with export sales in 2006 that was fully terminated for 2007. The US laws granting this export tax benefit were modified as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and this benefit is no longer available. A new tax benefit associated with US manufacturing operations passed into law under the same Act will be phased in over a five year period beginning in 2005. Whereas the timing of the phase out of the export tax benefit and the phase in of the manufacturing tax benefit may differ, we expect the tax reduction associated with the new manufacturing deduction, when fully implemented, to be similar in amount to the export benefit. We anticipate our tax rate for 2008 to be in the range of approximately 32% to 34% for continuing operations. 39 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 The following table summarizes the Companys revenue and operating profit by operating segment in 2006 and 2005. The actual results include results from Varco operations from the acquisition date of March 11, 2005 (in millions): Years Ended December 31, Variance 2006 2005 $ % Revenue: Rig Technology $ 3,584.9 $ 2,216.8 $ 1,368.1 61.7 % Petroleum Services Supplies 2,425.0 1,645.8 779.2 47.3 % Distribution Services 1,369.6 1,074.5 295.1 27.5 % Eliminations (353.7 ) (292.6 ) (61.1 ) 20.9 % Total Revenue $ 7,025.8 $ 4,644.5 $ 2,381.3 51.3 % Operating Profit: Rig Technology $ 608.5 $ 238.4 $ 370.1 155.2 % Petroleum Services Supplies 545.6 281.0 264.6 94.2 % Distribution Services 94.0 46.6 47.4 101.7 % Unallocated expenses and eliminations (137.0 ) (89.2 ) (47.8 ) 53.6 % Total Operating Profit $ 1,111.1 $ 476.8 $ 634.3 133.0 % Operating Profit %: Rig Technology 17.0 % 10.8 % Petroleum Services Supplies 22.5 % 17.1 % Distribution Services 6.9 % 4.3 % Total Operating Profit % 15.8 % 10.3 % Rig Technology Rig Technology revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $3,584.9 million, an increase of $1,368.1 million (61.7%) compared to 2005. The increase can be attributed to the growing market for capital equipment, as evidenced by backlog growth, price increases implemented in 2005 and 2006, increases in spare parts and service revenue, and the merger with Varco, which was completed effective March 11, 2005. The increase in orders and backlog can be attributed to increased rig construction projects and higher capital investment by drilling contractors in 2006 as compared to 2005. Operating profit from Rig Technology was $608.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $370.1 million (155.2%) over the same period of 2005. The increase in operating profit was largely due to the increased activity and pricing discussed above and the 2005 merger with Varco. Additionally, 2005 operating profit included a second quarter charge of $21.7 million taken on a large Kazakhstan rig fabrication project as a result of additional costs attributed to higher rig up and material costs than originally planned. The Rig Technology group monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when we receive a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $6.0 billion at December 31, 2006, an increase of $3.7 billion (161.2%) over backlog of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2005. Substantially all of the current backlog will be delivered by the end of 2009. Petroleum Services Supplies Revenue from Petroleum Services Supplies was $2,425.0 million for 2006 compared to $1,645.8 million for 2005, an increase of $779.2 million (47.3%). In part, the increase was attributable to the addition of product lines acquired from Varco, which totaled approximately $192.9 million. The remaining increase was attributable to the higher demand for all products and services offered by the segment. Solids control equipment sales and rentals, rig instrumentation packages, drill pipe coating services, fiberglass pipe, and pumping products achieved revenue increases ranging from 35% to 50%. These increases were the result of strong North America and worldwide drilling markets, as reflected by rig count increases of 15% and 11%, respectively, for 2006 compared to 2005. Petroleum Services Supplies also benefited from price increases implemented during 2005. 40 Table of Contents Operating profit from Petroleum Services Supplies was $545.6 million for 2006 compared to $281.0 million for 2005, an increase of $264.6 million (94.2%). The incremental operating profit from the addition of product lines acquired from Varco was approximately $28.4 million. The majority of the remaining increase was attributable to higher profitability across virtually all product lines, driven by higher volumes and improved pricing discussed above. Operating profit dollar increases ranging from 73% to 103% were achieved from downhole tool sales and rentals, sales of pumping products, inspection services, and solids control equipment sales and rentals. Distribution Services Revenue from Distribution Services totaled $1,369.6 million, an increase of $295.1 million (27.5%) from the prior period. The number of drilling rigs actively searching for oil and gas is a key metric for this business segment. According to the Baker Hughes rig count report, the average number of rigs operating in the world in 2006 was up 11% over the prior period. The average rig count in North America in 2006 was up 15% over the prior period to 2,118 rigs with our North American revenues up $196.9 million (27%). In the International market, revenues increased 26% while international rig count activity increased by 2%. The international revenue growth over the prior period reflects additional large contract awards, the extension of US based contracts into the international arena, increased volume from our global alliance customers and increased export activity. From a product perspective, maintenance, repair and operating supply (MRO) commodities in 2006 experienced a 33% increase over 2005. Sales of our manufactured products increased nearly 40% largely in the second half of the year. Margins were up considerably for MRO goods, driven by strategic bulk purchases and positioning of key commodities. OEM product margins were largely flat due to a large portion of these revenues locked in at fixed margins on committed contracts. Operating income increased $47.4 million in 2006 to $94.0 million or 6.9% of revenue. Improved supplier rebates coupled with increased operating efficiencies largely achieved by absorbing the revenue increase across an already established distribution infrastructure and expense base were the main contributors to operating income improvement. Unallocated expenses and eliminations Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $137.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $89.2 million for 2005. The increase in operations costs was primarily due to greater inter segment profit eliminations. In addition, stock based compensation expense was $31.2 million for 2006 as compared to $15.6 million for 2005. The integration costs related to the Varco merger were $7.9 million and $31.7 million for the years ended 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest and financial costs Interest and financial costs were $48.7 million for 2006 compared to $52.9 million for 2005. The decrease was primarily due to favorable interest rate movements on the Companys outstanding interest rate swap agreements and repayment of the Companys $150 million 6.875% Senior Notes on July 1, 2005. See summary of outstanding debt at December 31, 2006 under Liquidity and Capital Resources. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net was an expense of $31.3 million and income of $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. The increase in expense was primarily due to a net foreign exchange loss which was $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to a net foreign exchange gain of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The 2006 foreign exchange losses were primarily due to the strengthening in Norwegian Kroner, British Pound Sterling, and Euro currencies compared to the U.S. Dollar. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Rates. Provision for income taxes The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 33.9% compared to 32.3% for 2005. The higher 2006 tax rate was due primarily to increased state income tax expenses and charges for increases in valuation allowances related to separate company operating losses that may not be deductible in the future. The tax rates also reflect a lower percentage of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and reduced benefits in the US associated with export sales in 2006 compared to 2005. The US laws granting this tax benefit were modified as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and this benefit will no longer be available after 2006. A new tax benefit associated with US manufacturing operations passed into law under the same Act will be phased in over a five year period beginning in 2005. 41 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2007, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,841.8 million, and total debt of $890.7 million. At December 31, 2006, cash and cash equivalents were $957.4 million and total debt was $840.3 million. The increase in cash holdings was primarily a result of increased operating activities and securing project orders that require large down payments and early payment terms. The Companys outstanding debt at December 31, 2007 consisted of $200.0 million of 5.65% Senior Notes due 2012, $200.0 million of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2011, $150.0 million of 6.5% Senior Notes due 2011, $150.0 million of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2012, $100.0 million of 7.5% Senior Notes due 2008, and other debt of $90.7 million. Cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was $1,188.0 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $1,216.7 million in 2006. Cash was used by operations primarily through increases in inventories of $757.6 million, receivables of $464.8 million, cost in excess of billings of $334.6 million and prepaid and other current assets of $143.6 million. These negative cash flows were offset by net income of $1,337.1 million, billings in excess of costs of $831.6 million and non cash charges of $214.1 million. Receivables increased due to greater revenue, pricing and activity in 2007 compared to 2006, while inventory increased due to continued higher costs, activity, growing backlog orders, and customer prepayments. Billings in excess of costs increased due to early payment terms in relation to construction projects. For the year ended December 31, 2007, cash used by investing activities was $574.9 million compared to $530.1 million used for 2006. We used $323.9 million to complete eight acquisitions during 2007 and the final payment for NQL Energy Services, Inc. Capital spending of $251.8 million was primarily related to rental assets associated with the Companys Petroleum Services Supplies operations and capital expansion related to increased capacity for manufacturing operations. For the year ended December 31, 2007, cash provided by financing activities was $149.6 million compared to $41.1 million in 2006. Cash was provided by financing activities through proceeds from stock options exercised of $91.3 million, excess tax benefit from exercise of stock options of $22.9 million and net borrowings of $35.4 million. We believe cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facilities and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund operations, working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and financing obligations. We also believe increases in capital expenditures caused by any need to increase manufacturing capacity can be funded from operations or through debt financing. In addition, the Company is negotiating to replace the existing $500 million unsecured credit facility with $3 billion of unsecured credit facilities. We expect the facilities to consist of a $2 billion five year revolving credit facility, and a $1 billion, 364 day revolving credit facility. A portion of the proceeds will be used to finance the Grant Prideco transaction, with the credit facility closing concurrent with the Grant Prideco transaction closing. A summary of the Companys outstanding contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 is as follows (in millions): Payment Due by Period Less than 1 After 5 Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Years Total debt $ 890.7 $ 152.8 $ 33.8 $ 703.7 $ 0.4 Operating leases 378.6 94.4 123.5 64.6 96.1 Total contractual obligations $ 1,269.3 $ 247.2 $ 157.3 $ 768.3 $ 96.5 Standby letters of credit $ 1,712.4 $ 719.9 $ 735.2 $ 257.3 $ As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $ 53.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 14, Income Tax, to the consolidated financial statements included herein. We intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates, but the timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted. The Company expects to increase its capital spending approximately 20% in 2008 to exceed $300 million. We expect to fund future cash acquisitions and capital spending primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings, including the unborrowed portion of the credit facility or new debt issuances, but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions. There can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us. 42 Table of Contents Inflation has had an impact on certain of our operations in recent years. We believe that the higher costs for energy, steel and other commodities experienced in 2007 have largely been mitigated by increased prices and component surcharges for the products we sell. However, higher steel, labor, energy or other commodity prices may adversely impact future periods. Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing the financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition under long term construction contracts; allowance for doubtful accounts; inventory reserves; impairments of long lived assets (excluding goodwill); goodwill impairment and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable. The combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material. Revenue Recognition under Long term Construction Contracts The Company uses the percentage of completion method to account for certain long term construction contracts in the Rig Technology group. These long term construction contracts include the following characteristics: the contracts include custom designs for customer specific applications; the structural design is unique and requires significant engineering efforts; and construction projects often have progress payments. This method requires the Company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project, progress against the project schedule and the estimated completion date, all of which impact the amount of revenue and gross margin the Company recognizes in each reporting period. The Company prepares detailed cost to complete estimates at the beginning of each project, taking into account all factors considered likely to affect gross margin. Significant projects and their related costs and profit margins are updated and reviewed at least quarterly by senior management. Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include shipyard access, weather, production efficiencies, availability and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents and other factors as mentioned in Risk Factors. These factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the Companys estimates and materially impact the Companys future reported earnings. Historically, the Companys estimates have been reasonably dependable regarding the recognition of revenues and gross profits on percentage of completion contracts, excluding $21.7 million of losses recorded in 2005 resulting from changes in cost estimates relating to two rigs delivered to Kazakhstan as discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Excluding these losses, and based upon an analysis of percentage of completion contracts for all open contracts outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005, adjustments (representing the differences between the estimated and actual results) to all outstanding contracts resulted in changes to gross profit margins of 0.3% ($4.3 million on $1.6 billion of outstanding contracts) and 1.1% ($12.1 million on $1.1 billion of outstanding contracts, respectively). While the Company believes that its estimates on outstanding contracts at December 31, 2007 and in future periods will continue to be reasonably dependable under percentage of completion accounting, the factors identified in the preceding paragraph could result in significant adjustments in future periods. The Company has recorded revenue on outstanding contracts (on a contract to date basis) of $3.8 billion at December 31, 2007. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The determination of the collectibility of amounts due from customer accounts requires the Company to make judgments regarding future events and trends. Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on a continuous process of assessing the Companys portfolio on an individual customer and overall basis. This process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, and financial condition of the Companys customers. Based on a review of these factors, the Company will establish or adjust allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable portfolio as a whole. A substantial portion of the Companys revenues come from international oil companies, international shipyards, international oilfield service companies, and government owned or government controlled oil companies. Therefore, the Company has significant receivables in many foreign jurisdictions. If worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions deteriorate, the creditworthiness of the Companys customers could also deteriorate and they may be unable to pay these receivables, and additional allowances could be required. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, allowance for bad debts totaled $44.8 million and $30.4 million, or 2.1% and 1.8% of gross accounts receivable, respectively. 43 Table of Contents Historically, the Companys charge offs and provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts have been immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. However, because of the risk factors mentioned above, changes in our estimates could become material in future periods. Inventory Reserves Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The Company determines reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on hand, assumptions about future demand and market conditions, and estimates about potential alternative uses, which are usually limited. The Companys inventory consists of specialized spare parts, work in process, and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the Companys large installed base of specialized equipment used throughout the oilfield. Customers rely on the Company to stock these specialized items to ensure that their equipment can be repaired and serviced in a timely manner. The Companys estimated carrying value of inventory therefore depends upon demand driven by oil and gas drilling and well remediation activity, which depends in turn upon oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, available financing for the Companys customers, political stability in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, inventory reserves totaled 3.7% and 4.5% of gross inventory, respectively. Recent high demand and a strong outlook for oilfield equipment sales provide the basis for the Companys December 31, 2007 and 2006 estimates regarding the future usage and realizable value of inventory. While inventory reserves and accruals have not had a material impact on the Companys financial results for the periods covered in this report, changes in worldwide oil and gas activity, or the development of new technologies which make older drilling technologies obsolete, could require the Company to record additional allowances to reduce the value of its inventory. Such changes in our estimates could be material under weaker market conditions or outlook. Impairment of Long Lived Assets (Excluding Goodwill) Long lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and identified intangible assets, comprise a significant amount of the Companys total assets. The Company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation and amortization methods and estimated useful lives. Additionally, the carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable. This requires the Company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. These forecasts require assumptions about demand for the Companys products and services, future market conditions and technological developments. The forecasts are dependent upon assumptions regarding oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, available financing for the Companys customers, political stability in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors. Significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions or the intended use of these assets could require a provision for impairment in a future period. There have been no impairment charges of long lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Goodwill Impairment The Company has approximately $2.4 billion of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment of goodwill could include (but are not limited to) a significant reduction in worldwide oil and gas prices or drilling; a significant reduction in profitability or cash flow of oil and gas companies or drilling contractors; a significant reduction in worldwide well remediation activity; a significant reduction in capital investment by other oilfield service companies; or a significant increase in worldwide inventories of oil or gas. The timing and magnitude of any goodwill impairment charge, which could be material, would depend on the timing and severity of the event or events triggering the charge and would require a high degree of management judgment. The Company performs a review of goodwill for impairment annually or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. The annual impairment tests are performed during the fourth quarter of each year. If it is determined that goodwill is impaired, that impairment is measured based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill and identified intangibles is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of that reporting unit as a whole. Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if the Company encounters events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that, more likely than not, the carrying amount of goodwill and identified intangibles has been impaired. Fair value of the reporting units is determined based on 44 Table of Contents internal management estimates, using a combination of three methods: discounted cash flow, comparable companies, and representative transactions. Changes in the assumptions used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value, which may give rise to an impairment of goodwill. In addition to the annual review, the Company also tests for impairment should an event occur or circumstances change that may indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company had no impairment of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Income Taxes The Company is a U.S. registered company and is subject to income taxes in the U.S. The Company operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. Income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates of the countries in which the Company operates and income is earned. The Companys annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income, statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The determination and evaluation of the annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. It requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of income, deductions and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or the Companys level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could impact the tax liability in any given year. The Company also operates in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the pricing of transactions between related parties are open to interpretation, which could potentially result in aggressive tax authorities asserting additional tax liabilities with no offsetting tax recovery in other countries. The Company maintains liabilities for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation. The annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that the Company considers appropriate, as well as related interest. Tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing and certain tax credits which may not ultimately be sustained. These exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means. The Company is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions which may result in proposed assessments. The Company believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures under the guidance in FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which is an interpretation of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. However, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The Company reviews these liabilities quarterly and to the extent audits or other events result in an adjustment to the liability accrued for a prior year, the effect will be recognized in the period of the event. The Company currently has recorded valuation allowances that the Company intends to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Other than valuation allowances associated with tax attributes acquired through acquisitions, income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in the Companys valuation allowances. The realization of remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that the Company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision. The Company has not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested. Should the Company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries, the Company may be required to record additional taxes. Unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries were $1,580.0 million and $1,116.3 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company makes an annual determination whether to permanently reinvest these earnings. If, as a result of these reassessments, the Company distributes these earnings in the future, additional tax liability would result, offset by any available foreign tax credits. The Company does not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability, if any, is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated. These include, among others, the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities; the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process; the impartiality of the local courts; and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce, or fail to produce, an offsetting tax change in other countries. 45 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes a framework for fair value measurements in the financial statements by providing a single definition of fair value, provides guidance on the methods used to estimate fair value and increases disclosures about estimates of fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, SFAS 157 will have on our financial disclosures as well as our consolidated financial position, cash flows, and results from operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the end of the employers fiscal year is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 158 recognizing the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and recognized changes in the funded status in the year in which they occurred through comprehensive income effective December 31, 2006 with no material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not elect early adoption of the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of our fiscal year end. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 provides entities with an option to measure many financial assets and liabilities and certain other items at fair value as determined on an instrument by instrument basis. The Company has not yet evaluated the impact, if any, this standard might have on the Companys consolidated financial statements once it becomes effective on January 1, 2008. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R provides revised guidance on how acquirers recognize and measure the consideration transferred, identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business combination. SFAS 141R also expands required disclosures surrounding the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company does expect that this new standard will impact certain aspect of its accounting for business combinations on a prospective basis, including the determination of fair values assigned to certain purchased assets and liabilities. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes requirements for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the Company (previously called minority interests) be clearly identified, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parents equity. All changes in the parents ownership interests are required to be accounted for consistently as equity transactions and any noncontrolling equity investments in deconsolidated subsidiaries must be measured initially at fair value. SFAS 160 is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. However, presentation and disclosure requirements must be retrospectively applied to comparative financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS 160 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. ForwardLooking Statements Some of the information in this document contains, or has incorporated by reference, forward looking statements. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements typically are identified by use of terms such as may, will, expect, anticipate, estimate, and similar words, although some forward looking statements are expressed differently. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from results anticipated in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in oil and gas prices, customer demand for our products and worldwide economic activity. You should also consider carefully the statements under Risk Factors which address additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward looking statements. Given these uncertainties, current or prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any such factors or forward looking statements to reflect future events or developments. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Additional information concerning each of these matters follows: Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We have extensive operations in foreign countries. The net assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, although such fluctuations generally do not affect income since their functional currency is typically the local currency. These operations also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency, which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that do impact income. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company reported foreign currency gains (losses) of ($7.0) million, ($21.0) million, and $2.9 million, respectively. The gains (losses) were primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. The 2007 foreign exchange loss is primarily the result in the strengthening of the following major currencies against the U.S. dollar: British Pound 1.9%, Canadian Dollar 18.8%, Euro 11.6% and the Norwegian Kroner 13.0%. Further strengthening of these currencies against the U.S. dollar may continue to create similar losses in future periods to the extent we maintain net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the countries using the above currencies as their functional currency. Certain revenues in foreign countries are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those U.S. dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency. Similarly, some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, but have associated U.S. dollar costs, which also gives rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure. In order to mitigate that risk, we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. At December 31, 2007, we had entered into foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating $1,024.2 million to hedge cash flow exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies. These exposures arise when local currency operating expenses are not in balance with local currency revenue collections. Based on quoted market prices as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates, we have recorded a gain of $11.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, to adjust these foreign currency forward contracts to their fair market value. This gain is included in other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet. It is expected that $6.4 million of the gain will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. At December 31, 2007, the Company has cash flow hedges in place through the first quarter of 2011. A gain from ineffectiveness of $4.6 million is included in earnings related to these foreign currency contracts as of December 31, 2007. Ineffectiveness for 2006 and 2005 was not material. At December 31, 2007, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating $1,579.1 million designated and qualifying as fair value hedges to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies. Based on quoted market prices as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates, we recorded a gain of $79.9 million and $25.0 million, respectively, to adjust these foreign currency forward contracts to their fair market value. This gain is offset by designated losses on the firm commitments. A loss from ineffectiveness of ($0.6) million is included in earnings related to these foreign currency contracts as of December 31, 2007. Ineffectiveness for 2006 and 2005 was not material. At December 31, 2007, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating $279.2 million to offset exposures to the currency fluctuation of nonfunctional currency balance sheet accounts, primarily consisting of account receivables and account payables, and are not designated as hedges. Therefore, changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded each period in current earnings. At December 31, 2007, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating $1,221.6 million designated and qualifying as net investment hedges of our Norwegian operations. Based on market prices as of December 31, 2007 for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates, we have recorded a gain of $7.5 million, net of tax of $4.4 million to adjust these foreign contracts to their fair market value. This gain is included in other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet. 47 Table of Contents The maturity of the above forward contracts by currency is (in millions): Hedge Classification Currency 2008 2009 2010 2011 Total Cash Flow DKK $ 7.6 $ $ $ $ 7.6 EUR 31.0 35.3 11.8 78.1 GBP 2.9 15.5 18.4 SEK 0.6 0.6 SGD 0.4 0.3 0.7 USD 269.6 524.9 118.9 5.4 918.8 $ 312.1 $ 576.0 $ 130.7 $ 5.4 $ 1,024.2 Fair Value EUR $ 170.1 $ 26.7 $ 0.6 $ $ 197.4 GBP 11.7 11.7 KRW 1.0 1.0 SGD 5.9 1.3 7.2 USD 1,005.0 353.4 2.1 1.3 1,361.8 $ 1,193.7 $ 381.4 $ 2.7 $ 1.3 $ 1,579.1 Balance Sheet EUR $ 0.1 $ $ $ $ 0.1 GBP 0.1 0.1 SDG 0.7 0.7 USD 276.8 1.5 278.3 $ 277.7 $ 1.5 $ $ $ 279.2 Net Investment CAD $ 601.4 $ $ $ $ 601.4 NOK 620.2 620.2 $ 1,221.6 $ $ $ $ 1,221.6 Total $ 3,005.1 $ 958.9 $ 133.4 $ 6.7 $ 4,104.1 The Company had other financial market risk sensitive instruments denominated in foreign currencies totaling $87.7 million as of December 31, 2007 excluding trade receivables and payables, which approximate fair value. These market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances and overdraft facilities. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on these financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect net income by $5.7 million. The counterparties to forward contracts are major financial institutions. The credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis. In the unlikely event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract, our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential. We assess the functional currencies of our operating units to ensure that the appropriate currencies are utilized in accordance with the guidance of SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. Effective January 1, 2008, we changed the functional currency of our Rig Technology unit in Norway from the Norwegian Kroner to the U.S. dollar to more appropriately reflect the primary economic environment in which they operate. This change was precipitated by significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances, including: the increased order rate for large drilling platforms and components technology, the use of our Norway unit as our preferred project manager of these projects, increasing revenue and cost base in U.S. dollars, and the implementation of an international cash pool. As a Norwegian Kroner functional unit, Norway was subject to increasing foreign currency exchange risk as a result of these changes in its economic environment and was dependent upon significant hedging transactions to offset its non functional currency positions. At December 31, 2007, our Norway operations had derivatives with $2,550.5 million in notional value with a fair value of $91.3 million as compared to $1,394.6 million and $48.5 million at December 31, 2006, respectively, to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk against the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency. Effective with the change in the functional currency, the Company terminated these hedges. The related net position of $108.8 million associated with the terminated hedges will be recognized into earnings in the future periods the forecasted transactions affect earnings. The Company has subsequent to January 1, 2008, entered into new hedges to cover the exposures as a result of the changes to U.S. dollar functional. 48 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2007, our long term borrowings consisted of $100 million in 7.5% Senior Notes, $150 million in 6.5% Senior Notes, $200 million in 7.25% Senior Notes, $200 million in 5.65% Senior Notes and $150 million in 5.5% Senior Notes. We had $90.7 million of other borrowings at December 31, 2007. We occasionally have borrowings under our other credit facilities, and a portion of these borrowings could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market risk with exchange rate movements. These instruments carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from either LIBOR, NIBOR or EURIBOR, or at the prime interest rate. Under our credit facilities, we may, at our option, fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over LIBOR, NIBOR or EURIBOR for 30 days to 6 months. Our objective is to maintain a portion of our debt in variable rate borrowings for the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed rate borrowings. As of December 31, 2007, we had three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $100 million associated with our 2008 Senior Notes. Under this agreement, we receive interest at a fixed rate of 7.5% and pay interest at a floating rate of six month LIBOR plus a weighted average spread of approximately 4.675%. The swap agreements will settle semi annually and will terminate in February 2008. The swap agreements originally entered into by Varco were recorded at their fair market value at the date of the Merger and no longer qualify as effective hedges under FAS 133. The swaps have been marked to market for periods subsequent to the Merger and any change in their value has been reported as an adjustment to interest expense. The change in the fair market value of the interest swap agreements resulted in a $0.3 million decrease in interest expense for the period ended December 31, 2007.
