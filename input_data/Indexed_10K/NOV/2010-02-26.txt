Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview of Oil and Gas Well Drilling and Servicing Processes Oil and gas wells are usually drilled by drilling contractors using a drilling rig. A bit is attached to the end of a drill stem, which is assembled by the drilling rig and its crew from 30 foot joints of drill pipe and specialized drilling components known as downhole tools. Using the conventional rotary drilling method, the drill stem is turned from the rotary table of the drilling rig by torque applied to the kelly, which is screwed into the top of the drill stem. Increasingly, drilling is performed using a drilling motor, which is attached to the bottom of the drill stem and provides rotational force directly to the bit, rather than such force being supplied by the rotary table. The use of a drilling motor permits the drilling contractor to drill directionally, including horizontally. The Company sells and rents drilling motors, drill bits, downhole tools and drill pipe through its Petroleum Services Supplies segment. During drilling, heavy drilling fluids or drilling muds are pumped down the drill stem and forced out through jets in the bit. The drilling mud returns to the surface through the space between the borehole wall and the drill stem, carrying with it the drill cuttings drilled out by the bit. The drill cuttings are removed from the mud by a solids control system (which can include shakers, centrifuges and other specialized equipment) and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. The solids control system permits the mud, which is often comprised of expensive chemicals, to be continuously reused and re circulated back into the hole. Through its Rig Technology segment, the Company sells the large mud pumps that are used to pump drilling mud through the drill stem. Through its Petroleum Services Supplies business, the Company sells transfer pumps and mud pump consumables; sells and rents solids control equipment; and provides solids control, waste management and drilling fluids services. Many operators internally coat the drill stem to improve its hydraulic efficiency and protect it from corrosive fluids sometimes encountered during drilling, and inspect and assess the integrity of the drill pipe from time to time. The Company provides drill pipe inspection and coating services, and applies hardbanding material to drill pipe to improve its wear characteristics. These services are provided through the Companys Petroleum Services Supplies segment. Additionally, the Companys Petroleum Services Supplies segment manufactures and sells drill pipe. As the hole depth increases, the kelly must be removed frequently so that additional 30 foot joints of drill pipe can be added to the drill stem. When the bit becomes dull or the equipment at the bottom of the drill stem including the drilling motors otherwise requires servicing, the entire drill stem is pulled out of the hole and disassembled by disconnecting the joints of drill pipe. These are set aside or racked, the old bit is replaced or service is performed, and the drill stem is reassembled and lowered back into the hole (a process called tripping). During drilling and tripping operations, joints of drill pipe must be screwed together and tightened (made up), and loosened and unscrewed (spun out). The Companys Rig Technology business provides drilling equipment to manipulate and maneuver the drill pipe in this manner. When the hole has reached certain depths, all of the drill pipe is pulled out of the hole and larger diameter pipe known as casing is lowered into the hole and permanently cemented in place in order to protect against collapse and contamination of the hole. The casing is typically inspected before it is lowered into the hole, a service the Companys Petroleum Services Supplies business provides. The Companys Rig Technology segment manufactures pressure pumping equipment that is used to cement the casing in place. The raising and lowering of the drill stem while drilling or tripping, and the lowering of casing into the wellbore, is accomplished with the rigs hoisting system. A conventional hoisting system is a block and tackle mechanism that works within the drilling rigs derrick. The lifting of this mechanism is performed via a series of pulleys that are attached to the drawworks at the base of the derrick. The Companys Rig Technology segment sells and installs drawworks and pipe hoisting systems. During the course of normal drilling operations, the drill stem passes through different geological formations, which exhibit varying pressure characteristics. If this pressure is not contained, oil, gas and or water would flow out of these formations to the surface. 4 Table of Contents The two means of containing these pressures are (i) primarily the circulation of drilling muds while drilling and (ii) secondarily the use of blowout preventers should the mud prove inadequate and in an emergency situation. The Companys Rig Technology group sells and services blowout preventers (BOPs). Drilling muds are carefully designed to exhibit certain qualities that optimize the drilling process. In addition to containing formation pressure, they must (i) provide power to the drilling motor, (ii) carry drilled solids to the surface, (iii) protect the drilled formations from being damaged, and (iv) cool the drill bit. Achieving these objectives often requires a formulation specific to a given well and can involve the use of expensive chemicals as well as natural materials such as certain types of clay. The fluid itself is often oil or more expensive synthetic mud. Given this expense, it is highly desirable to reuse as much of the drilling mud as possible. Solids control equipment such as shale shakers, centrifuges, cuttings dryers, and mud cleaners help accomplish this objective. The Companys Petroleum Services Supplies group rents, sells, operates and services this equipment. Drilling muds are formulated based on expected drilling conditions. However, as the hole is drilled, the drill stem may encounter a high pressure zone where the mud density is inadequate to maintain sufficient pressure. Should efforts to weight up the mud in order to contain such a pressure kick fail, a blowout could result, whereby reservoir fluids would flow uncontrolled into the well. To prevent blowouts to the surface of the well, a series of high pressure valves known as blowout preventers are positioned at the top of the well and, when activated, form tight seals that prevent the escape of fluids. When closed, conventional BOPs prevent normal rig operations. Therefore, the BOPs are activated only if drilling mud and normal well control procedures cannot safely contain the pressure. BOPs have been designed to contain pressures of up to 20,000 psi. The operations of the rig and the condition of the drilling mud are closely monitored by various sensors, which measure operating parameters such as the weight on the rigs hook, the incidence of pressure kicks, the operation of the drilling mud pumps, etc. Through its Rig Technology segment, the Company sells and rents drilling rig instrumentation packages that perform these monitoring functions. During the drilling and completion of a well, there exists an ongoing need for various consumables and spare parts. While most of these items are small, in the aggregate they represent an important element of the process. Since it is impractical for each drilling location to have a full supply of these items, drilling contractors and well service companies tend to rely on third parties to stock and deliver these items. The Company provides this capability through its Distribution Services segment, which stocks and sells spares and consumables made by third parties, as well as spares and consumables made by the Company. After the well has reached its total depth and the final section of casing has been set, the drilling rig is moved off of the well and the well is prepared to begin producing oil or gas in a process known as well completion. Well completion usually involves installing production tubing concentrically in the casing. Due to the corrosive nature of many produced fluids, production tubing is often inspected and coated, services offered by the Companys Petroleum Services Supplies business. Sometimes operators choose to use corrosion resistant composite materials (which the Company offers through its Petroleum Services Supplies business), or corrosion resistant alloys, or operators sometimes pump fluids into wells to inhibit corrosion. From time to time, a producing well may undergo workover procedures to extend its life and increase its production rate. Workover rigs are used to disassemble the wellhead, tubing and other completion components of an existing well in order to stimulate or remediate the well. Workover rigs are similar to drilling rigs in their capabilities to handle tubing, but are usually smaller and somewhat less sophisticated. The Company offers a comprehensive range of workover rigs through its Rig Technology segment. Tubing and sucker rods removed from a well during a well remediation operation are often inspected to determine their suitability to be reused in the well, which is a service the Companys Petroleum Services Supplies business provides. Frequently coiled tubing units or wireline units are used to accomplish certain well remediation operations or well completions. Coiled tubing is a recent advancement in petroleum technology consisting of a continuous length of reeled steel tubing which can be injected concentrically into the production tubing all the way to the bottom of most wells. It permits many operations to be performed without disassembling the production tubing, and without curtailing the production of the well. Wireline winch units are devices that utilize single strand or multi strand wires to perform well remediation operations, such as lowering tools and transmitting data to the surface. Through the Rig Technology segment, the Company sells and rents various types of coiled tubing equipment, and wireline equipment and tools. The Company also manufactures and sells coiled tubing pipe through its Petroleum Services Supplies segment. 5 Table of Contents Rig Technology The Company has a long tradition of pioneering innovations in drilling and well servicing equipment which improve the efficiency, safety, and cost of drilling and well servicing operations. The Rig Technology segment designs, manufactures and sells a wide variety of top drives, automated pipe handling systems, motion compensation systems, rig controls, BOPs, handling tools, drawworks, risers, rotary tables, mud pumps, cranes, drilling motors and other drilling equipment for both the onshore and offshore markets. The Rig Technology segment also manufactures entire rig packages, both drilling and workover, in addition to well servicing equipment such as coiled tubing units, pressure pumping equipment, and wireline winches. The Rig Technology group sells directly to drilling contractors, shipyards and other rig fabricators, well servicing companies, national oil companies, major and independent oil and gas companies, supply stores, and pipe running service providers. The Rig Technology segment rents and sells proprietary drilling rig instrumentation packages and control systems which monitor various processes throughout the drilling operation, under the name MD /Totco (Instrumentation). Demand for its products, several of which are described below, is strongly dependent upon capital spending plans by oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, and the level of oil and gas well drilling activity. Land Rig Packages. NOV designs, manufactures, assembles, upgrades, and supplies equipment sets to a variety of land drilling rigs, including those specifically designed to operate in harsh environments such as the Arctic Circle and the desert. Our key land rig product names include the Drake Rig, Ideal Rig and Rapid Rig . NOVs recent rig packages are designed to be safer and fast moving, to utilize AC technology, and to reduce manpower required to operate a rig. Top Drives. The Top Drive Drilling System (TDS), originally introduced by NOV in 1982, significantly alters the traditional drilling process. The TDS rotates the drill stem from its top, rather than by the rotary table, with a large electric motor affixed to rails installed in the derrick that traverses the length of the derrick to the rig floor. Therefore, the TDS eliminates the use of the conventional rotary table for drilling. Components of the TDS also are used to connect additional joints of drill pipe to the drill stem during drilling operations, enabling drilling with three joints of drill pipe compared to traditionally drilling with one joint of drill pipe. Additionally, the TDS facilitates horizontal and extended reach drilling. Drilling Motors. NOV has helped lead the application of AC motor technology in the oilfield industry. We are now transitioning from buying motors from third parties to building them in our own facilities and further developing motor technology, including the introduction of permanent magnet motor technology to the industry. These permanent magnet motors are being used in top drives, cranes, mud pumps, winches, and drawworks. Rotary Equipment. The alternative to using a TDS to rotate the drill stem is to use a rotary table, which rotates the pipe at the floor of the rig. The Rig Technology group produces rotary tables as well as kelly bushings and master bushings for most sizes of kellys and makes of rotary tables. In 1998, NOV introduced the Rotary Support Table for use on rigs with a TDS. The Rotary Support Table is used in concert with the TDS to completely eliminate the need for the larger conventional rotary table. Pipe Handling Systems. Pipe racking systems are used to handle drill pipe, casing and tubing on a drilling rig. Vertical pipe racking systems move drill pipe and casing between the well and a storage (racking) area on the rig floor. Horizontal racking systems are used to handle tubulars while stored horizontally (for example, on the pipe deck of an offshore rig) and transport tubulars up to the rig floor and into a vertical position for use in the drilling process. Vertical pipe racking systems are used predominantly on offshore rigs and are found on almost all floating rigs. Mechanical vertical pipe racking systems greatly reduce the manual effort involved in pipe handling. Pipe racking systems, introduced by NOV in 1985, provide a fully automated mechanism for handling and racking drill pipe during drilling and tripping operations, spinning and torquing drill pipe, and automatic hoisting and racking of disconnected joints of drill pipe. These functions can be integrated via computer controlled sequencing, and operated by a driller in an environmentally secure cabin. An important element of this system is the Iron Roughneck, which was originally introduced by NOV in 1976 and is an automated device that makes pipe connections on the rig floor and requires less direct involvement of rig floor personnel in potentially dangerous operations. The Automated Roughneck is an automated microprocessor controlled version of the Iron Roughneck. Horizontal pipe transfer systems were introduced by NOV in 1993. They include the Pipe Deck Machine (PDM), which is used to manipulate and move tubulars while stored in a horizontal position; the Pipe Transfer Conveyor (PTC), which transports sections of pipe to the rig floor; and a Pickup Laydown System (PLS), which raises the pipe to a vertical position for transfer to a vertical racking system. These components may be employed separately, or incorporated together to form a complete horizontal racking system, known as the Pipe Transfer System (PTS). 6 Table of Contents Pipe Handling Tools. The Companys pipe handling tools are designed to enhance the safety, efficiency and reliability of pipe handling operations. Many of these tools have provided innovative methods of performing the designated task through mechanization of functions previously performed manually. The Rig Technology group manufactures various tools used to grip, tochold, raise, and lower pipe, and in the making up and breaking out of drill pipe, workstrings, casing and production tubulars including spinning wrenches, manual tongs, torque wrenches and kelly spinners. Mud Pumps. Mud pumps are high pressure pumps located on the rig that force drilling mud down the drill pipe, through the drill bit, and up the space between the drill pipe and the drilled formation (the annulus) back to the surface. These pumps, which generate pressures of up to 7,500 psi, must therefore be capable of displacing drilling fluids several thousand feet down and back up the well bore. The conventional mud pump design, known as the triplex pump, uses three reciprocating pistons oriented horizontally. Recently, NOV has introduced the HEX Pump, which uses six pumping cylinders, versus the three used in the triplex pump. Along with other design features, the greater number of cylinders reduces pulsations (or surges) and increases the output available from a given footprint. Reduced pulsation is desirable where downhole measurement equipment is being used during the drilling process, as is often the case in directional drilling. Hoisting Systems. Hoisting systems are used to raise or lower the drill stem while drilling or tripping, and to lower casing into the wellbore. The drawworks is the heart of the hoisting system. It is a large winch that spools off or takes in the drilling line, which is in turn connected to the drill stem at the top of the derrick. The drawworks also plays an important role in keeping the weight on the drill bit at a desired level. This task is particularly challenging on offshore drilling rigs, which are subject to wave motion. To address this, NOV has introduced the Active Heave Drilling (AHD) Drawworks. The AHD Drawworks uses computer controlled motors to compensate for the motion experienced in offshore drilling operations. Cranes. NOV provides a comprehensive range of crane solutions, with purpose built products for all segments of the oil and gas industry as well as many other markets. The Company encompasses a broad collection of brand names with international recognition, and includes a large staff of engineers specializing in the design of cranes and related equipment. The product range extends from small cargo handling cranes to the worlds largest marine cranes. In all, the Company provides over twenty crane product lines that include standard model configurations as well as custom engineered and specialty cranes. Motion Compensation Systems. Traditionally, motion compensation equipment is located on top of the drilling rig and serves to stabilize the bit on the bottom of the hole, increasing drilling effectiveness of floating offshore rigs by compensating for wave and wind action. The AHD Drawworks, discussed above, was introduced to eliminate weight and improve safety, removing the compensator from the top of the rig and integrating it into the drawworks system. In addition to the AHD Drawworks, NOV has introduced an Active Heave Compensation (AHC) System that goes beyond the capabilities of the AHD Drawworks to handle the most severe weather. Additionally, NOV tensioning systems provide continuous axial tension to the marine riser pipe (larger diameter pipe which connects floating drilling rigs to the well on the ocean floor) and guide lines on floating drilling rigs, tension leg platforms and jack up drilling rigs. Blowout Preventers. BOPs are devices used to seal the space (annulus) between the drill pipe and the borehole to prevent blowouts (uncontrolled flows of formation fluids and gases to the surface). The Rig Technology group manufactures a wide array of BOPs used in various situations. Ram and annular BOPs are back up devices that are activated only if other techniques for controlling pressure in the wellbore are inadequate. When closed, these devices prevent normal rig operations. Ram BOPs seal the wellbore by hydraulically closing rams (thick heavy blocks of steel) against each other across the wellbore. Specially designed packers seal around specific sizes of pipe in the wellbore, shear pipe in the wellbore or close off an open hole. Annular BOPs seal the wellbore by hydraulically closing a rubber packing unit around the drill pipe or kelly or by sealing against itself if nothing is in the hole. NOVs Pressure Control While Drilling (PCWD) BOP, introduced in 1995, allows operators to drill at pressures up to 2,000 psi without interrupting normal operations, and can act as a normal spherical BOP at pressures up to 5,000 psi. In 1998, NOV introduced the NXT ram type BOP which eliminates door bolts, providing significant weight, rig time, and space savings. Its unique features make subsea operation more efficient through faster ram configuration changes without tripping the BOP stack. In 2004, NOV introduced the LXT, which features many of the design elements of the NXT, but is targeted at the land market. In 2005, the Company began commercializing technology related to a continuous circulation device. This device enables drilling contractors to make and break drill pipe connections without stopping the circulation of drilling fluids, which helps increase drilling efficiency. Derricks and Substructures. Drilling activities are carried out from a drilling rig. A drilling rig consists of one or two derricks; the substructure that supports the derrick(s); and the rig package, which consists of the various pieces of equipment discussed above. The Rig Technology segment designs, fabricates and services derricks used in both onshore and offshore applications, and substructures used in onshore applications. The Rig Technology group also works with shipyards in the fabrication of substructures for offshore drilling rigs. 7 Table of Contents Instrumentation. The Companys Instrumentation business provides drilling rig operators real time measurement and monitoring of critical parameters required to improve rig safety and efficiency. In 1999, the Company introduced its RigSense Wellsite Information System, which combines leading hardware and software technologies into an integrated drilling rig package. Access of drilling data is provided to offsite locations, enabling company personnel to monitor drilling operations from an office environment, through a secure link. Systems are both sold and rented, and are comprised of hazardous area sensors placed throughout the rig to measure critical drilling parameters; all networked back to a central command station for review, recording and interpretation. The Company offers unique business integration services to directly integrate information into business applications that improves accuracy and assists drilling contractors in managing their drilling business. Reports on drilling activities and processes are now provided from the rig site as a part of the DrillSuite business solution to allow contractors to streamline administration by eliminating manual entry of data, promotes accurate payroll processing and invoicing, and includes asset tracking and preventive maintenance management through its RigMS solution. The real time information provided also allows the Company to advance the drilling process using advanced drilling algorithms and electronic controls such as our Wildcat Auto Drilling System for better execution of the well plan, enhanced rates of penetration, reduced program costs, and improved wellbore quality. Complementing the Companys surface solutions is a portfolio of Down Hole Instrumentation (DHI) products for both straight hole and directional markets. Key advancements in this area include the introduction of the Companys time saving ETotco Electronic Drift Recorder, which serves as an electronic equivalent to the traditional mechanical drift tool that the Company has offered since 1929. Coiled Tubing Equipment. Coiled tubing consists of flexible steel tubing manufactured in a continuous string and spooled on a reel. It can extend several thousand feet in length and is run in and out of the wellbore at a high rate of speed by a hydraulically operated coiled tubing unit. A coiled tubing unit is typically mounted on a truck, semi trailer or skid (steel frames on which portable tocequipment is mounted to facilitate handling with cranes for offshore use) and consists of a hydraulically operated tubing reel or drum, an injector head which pushes or pulls the tubing in or out of the wellbore, and various power and control systems. Coiled tubing is typically used with sophisticated pressure control equipment which permits the operator to perform workover operations on a live well. The Rig Technology group manufactures and sells both coiled tubing units and the ancillary pressure control equipment used in these operations. Through its acquisition of Rolligon in late 2006, the Company enhanced its portfolio by adding additional pressure pumping and coiled tubing equipment products. Currently, most coiled tubing units are used in well remediation and completion applications. The Company believes that advances in the manufacturing process of coiled tubing, tubing fatigue protection and the capability to manufacture larger diameter and increased wall thickness coiled tubing strings have resulted in increased uses and applications for coiled tubing products. For example, some well operators are now using coiled tubing in drilling applications such as slim hole re entries of existing wells. NOV engineered and manufactured the first coiled tubing units built specifically for coiled tubing drilling in 1996. Generally, the Rig Technology group supplies customers with the equipment and components necessary to use coiled tubing, which the customers typically purchase separately. The groups coiled tubing product line consists of coiled tubing units, coiled tubing pressure control equipment, pressure pumping equipment, snubbing units (which are units that force tubulars into a well when pressure is contained within the wellbore), nitrogen pumping equipment and cementing, stimulation, fracturing and blending equipment. Wireline Equipment. NOVs wireline products include wireline drum units, which consist of a spool or drum of wireline cable, mounted in a mobile vehicle or skid, which works in conjunction with a source of power (an engine mounted in the vehicle or within a separate power pack skid). The wireline drum unit is used to spool wireline cable into or out of a well, in order to perform surveys inside the well, sample fluids from the bottom of the well, retrieve or replace components from inside the well, or to perform other well remediation or survey operations. The wireline used may be slick line, which is conventional single strand steel cable used to convey tools in or out of the well, or electric line, which contains an imbedded single conductor or multi conductor electrical line which permits communication between the surface and electronic instruments attached to the end of the wireline at the bottom of the well. Wireline units are usually used in conjunction with a variety of other pressure control equipment which permit safe access into wells while they are flowing and under pressure at the surface. The Company engineers and manufactures a broad range of pressure control equipment for wireline operations, including wireline blowout preventers, strippers, packers, lubricators and grease injection units. Additionally, the Company makes wireline rigging equipment such as mast trucks. Facilities. The Company conducts Rig Technology manufacturing operations at major facilities in Houston, Galena Park, Sugar Land, Conroe, Cedar Park, Anderson, Fort Worth and Pampa, Texas; Duncan, Oklahoma; Orange, California; Edmonton, Canada; Aberdeen, Scotland; Kristiansand, and Stavanger, Norway; Etten Leur and Groot Ammers, the Netherlands; Carquefou, France; Singapore; Lanzhou and Shanghai, China; Jebel Ali, Dubai; and Ulsan, South Korea. For a more detailed listing of significant facilities see Item 2. Properties. The Rig Technology group maintains sales and service offices in most major oilfield markets, either directly or through agents. 8 Table of Contents Customers and Competition. The Rig Technology segment sells directly to drilling contractors, other rig fabricators, well servicing companies, pressure pumping companies, national oil companies, major and independent oil and gas companies, supply stores, and pipe running service providers. Demand for its products is strongly dependent upon capital spending plans by oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, and the level of oil and gas well drilling activity. The products of the Rig Technology group are sold in highly competitive markets and its sales and earnings can be affected by competitive actions such as price changes, new product development, or improved availability and delivery. The groups primary competitors are Access Oil Tools; Aker Solutions AS; American Block; Bomco; Canrig (a division of Nabors Industries); Cavins Oil Tools; Cameron; DenCon Oil Tools; Forum Oilfield Technologies; General Electric; Hitec Drilling Products; Hong Hua; Huisman; IDM; LTI (a division of Rowan Companies); MI Electric; Tesco Corporation; Wirth MB GmbH; Stewart Stevenson, Inc.; Crown Energy Technologies; Huntings, Ltd.; Vanoil; Parveen Industries; and Weatherford International, Inc. Management believes that the principal competitive factors affecting its Rig Technology business are performance, quality, reputation, customer service, availability of products, spare parts, and consumables, breadth of product line and price. Petroleum Services Supplies The Company provides a broad range of support equipment, spare parts, consumables and services through the Petroleum Services Supplies segment. The Petroleum Services Supplies group sells directly and provides a variety of tubular services, composite tubing, and coiled tubing to oil and gas producers, national oil companies, drilling contractors, well servicing companies, and tubular processors, manufacturers and distributors. These include inspection and reclamation services for drill pipe, casing, production tubing, sucker rods and line pipe at drilling and workover rig locations, at yards owned by its customers, at steel mills and processing facilities that manufacture tubular goods, and at facilities which it owns. The group also provides internal coating of tubular goods at several coating plants worldwide and through licensees in certain locations. Additionally, the Company designs, manufactures and sells high pressure fiberglass and composite tubulars for use in corrosive applications and coiled tubing for use in well servicing applications and connections for large diameter conductor pipe. The Companys customers rely on tubular inspection services to avoid failure of tubing, casing, flowlines, pipelines and drill pipe. Such tubular failures are expensive and in some cases catastrophic. The Companys customers rely on internal coatings of tubular goods to prolong the useful lives of tubulars and to increase the volumetric throughput of in service tubular goods. The Companys customers sometimes use fiberglass or composite tubulars in lieu of conventional steel tubulars, due to the corrosion resistant properties of fiberglass and other composite materials. Tubular inspection and coating services are used most frequently in operations in high temperature, deep, corrosive oil and gas environments. In selecting a provider of tubular inspection and tubular coating services, oil and gas operators consider such factors as reputation, experience, technology of products offered, reliability and price. The Companys Petroleum Services Supplies group also provides products and services that are used in the course of drilling oil and gas wells. The Downhole Tools business sells and rents bits, drilling motors and specialized downhole tools that are incorporated into the drill stem during drilling operations (Downhole Tools), and are also used during fishing, well intervention, re entry, and well completion operations. The Wellsite Services business provides products and services such as drilling fluids, highly engineered solids control equipment, waste handling and treatment, completion fluids, power generation equipment, and other ancillary well site equipment and services. Wellsite Services is also engaged in Barium Sulfate (barite) mining operations in the State of Nevada. Barite is an inert powder material used as the primary weighting agent in drilling fluids. Additionally, efficient separation of drill cuttings enables the re use of often costly drilling fluids. The Pumps Expendables business provides centrifugal, reciprocating, and progressing cavity pumps and pump expendables (Pumps Expendables) into the global oil and gas and industrial markets. Solids Control and Waste Management. The Company is engaged in the provision of highly engineered equipment, products and services which separate and manage drill cuttings produced by the drilling process (Solids Control). Drill cuttings are usually contaminated with petroleum or drilling fluids, and must be disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. Fluids Services. The Company acquired the Spirit group of companies in May 2009 (Spirit) and Ambar in January 2010. Both are engaged in the provision of drilling fluids, completion fluids and other related services. This division is also engaged in barite mining operations. Drilling fluids are designed and used to maintain well bore stability while drilling, control downhole pressure, drill bit lubrication, and as a drill cuttings displacement medium. Completion fluids are used to clean the well bore and stimulate production. Portable Power. The acquisition of Welch Sales and Service, Inc. in 2008 placed Wellsite Services in the power generation and temperature control business. The Portable Power division provides rental equipment for use in the upstream oil and gas industry, refinery and petrochemical, construction, events, disaster relief and other industries. 9 Table of Contents Tubular Coating. The Company develops, manufactures and applies its proprietary tubular coatings, known as Tube Kote coatings, to new and used tubulars. Tubular coatings help prevent corrosion of tubulars by providing a tough plastic shield to isolate steel from corrosive oilfield fluids such as CO 2 , H 2 S and brine. Delaying or preventing corrosion extends the life of existing tubulars, reduces the frequency of well remediation and reduces expensive interruptions in production. In addition, coatings are designed to increase the fluid flow rate through tubulars by decreasing or eliminating paraffin and scale build up, which can reduce or block oil flow in producing wells. The smooth inner surfaces of coated tubulars often increase the fluid through put on certain high rate oil and gas wells by reducing friction and turbulence. The Companys reputation for supplying quality internal coatings is an important factor in its business, since the failure of coatings can lead to expensive production delays and premature tubular failure. In 2005, NOV created a 60% owned joint venture in China with the Huabei Petroleum Administration Bureau, which coats Chinese produced drill pipe using NOVs proprietary coatings. In 2007, the joint venture opened a second coating plant in Jiangyin City, China. In addition to our TK coatings, we also have complementary corrosion control products and services including TK Liners, TuboWrap, and KC IPC Connections. TK Liners are fiberglass reinforced tubes which are inserted into steel line pipe. This safeguards the pipe against corrosion and extends the life of the pipeline. In conjunction with the Thru Kote connection system customers can weld a sleeve for a continuous fiberglass lined pipeline. Tubo Wrap is a high performance external coating that protects the pipe during installation and from corrosion once the pipeline is in place. KC IPC Connections use a modified American Petroleum Institute (API) coupling to create a gas tight seal that prevents corrosion and turbulence in the critical connections of tubulars while protecting the internal plastic coating at the highly loaded contact points. Tubular Inspection. Newly manufactured pipe sometimes contains serious defects that are not detected at the mill. In addition, pipe can be damaged in transit and during handling prior to use at the well site. As a result, exploration and production companies often have new tubulars inspected before they are placed in service to reduce the risk of tubular failures during drilling, completion, or production of oil and gas wells. Used tubulars are inspected by the Company to detect service induced flaws after the tubulars are removed from operation. Used drill pipe and used tubing inspection programs allow operators to replace defective lengths, thereby prolonging the life of the remaining pipe and saving the customer the cost of unnecessary tubular replacements and expenses related to tubular failures. Tubular inspection services employ all major non destructive inspection techniques, including electromagnetic, ultrasonic, magnetic flux leakage and gamma ray. These inspection services are provided both by mobile units which work at the wellhead as used tubing is removed from a well, and at fixed site tubular inspection locations. The group provides an ultrasonic inspection service for detecting potential fatigue cracks in the end area of used drill pipe, the portion of the pipe that traditionally has been the most difficult to inspect. Tubular inspection facilities also offer a wide range of related services, such as API thread inspection, ring and plug gauging, and a complete line of reclamation services necessary to return tubulars to useful service, including tubular cleaning and straightening, hydrostatic testing and re threading. In addition, the Company applies hardbanding material to drill pipe, to enhance its wear characteristics and reduce downhole casing wear as a result of the drilling process. In 2002, the Company introduced its proprietary line of hardbanding material, TCS 8000. The group also cleans, straightens, inspects and coats sucker rods at 11 facilities throughout the Western Hemisphere. Additionally, new sucker rods are inspected before they are placed into service, to avoid premature failure, which can cause the oil well operator to have to pull and replace the sucker rod. Machining Services. In 2005, we acquired Turner Oilfield Services and expanded our product offering into thread repair, tool joint rebuilding and sub manufacturing. Since then we have made strategic acquisitions of Hendershot and Mid South and have expanded our machining services internally to develop a one stop shop concept for our drill pipe customers. Thread repair services include rotary shouldered and premium connections. We are licensed to perform thread repair services for API and proprietary connections. Tool joint rebuilding is a unique process to restore worn drill pipe tool joints, drill collars and heavy weight drill pipe to the original specifications to extend the service life of those assets. We manufacture downhole tools and are API licensed for this process in several locations. In November 2009, we acquired South Seas Inspection (S) Pte. Ltd., (SSI) and certain assets of its Brazilian affiliate. SSI provides a wide array of oilfield services including rig and derrick construction, derrick inspection and maintenance, drops surveys and load testing at the rig through the use of rope access technicians. This acquisition adds multiple new services and allows us to grow this business by leveraging existing relationships and infrastructure. These operations are based out of Singapore with branch offices in Baku, Azerbaijan and Aktau, Kazkhstan as well as a representative office in Vietnam. The highly trained workforce is completely mobile and provides these services worldwide. Mill Systems and Sales. The Company engineers and fabricates inspection equipment for steel mills, which it sells and rents. The equipment is used for quality control purposes to detect defects in the pipe during the high speed manufacturing process. Each piece of mill inspection equipment is designed to customer specifications and is installed and serviced by the Company. 10 Table of Contents Drill Pipe Products. The Company manufactures and sells a variety of drill stem products used for the drilling of oil and gas wells. The principal products sold by this segment are: (i) drill pipe, (ii) drill collars and heavyweight drill pipe and (iii) drill stem accessories including tool joints. Drill pipe is the principal tool, other than the rig, required for the drilling of an oil or gas well. Its primary purpose is to connect the above surface drilling rig to the drill bit. A drilling rig will typically have an inventory of 10,000 to 30,000 feet of drill pipe depending on the size and service requirements of the rig. Joints of drill pipe are connected to each other with a welded on tool joint to form what is commonly referred to as the drill string or drill stem. When a drilling rig is operating, motors mounted on the rig rotate the drill pipe and drill bit. In addition to connecting the drilling rig to the drill bit, drill pipe provides a mechanism to steer the drill bit and serves as a conduit for drilling fluids and cuttings. Drill pipe is a capital good that can be used for the drilling of multiple wells. Once a well is completed, the drill pipe may be used again and again to drill other wells until the drill pipe becomes damaged or wears out. In recent years, the depth and complexity of the wells our customers drill, as well as the specifications and requirements of the drill pipe they purchase, have substantially increased. A majority of the drill pipe we sell is required to meet specifications exceeding minimum API standards. We offer a broad line of premium drilling products designed for the offshore, international and domestic drilling markets. Our premium drilling products include our proprietary lines of XT and TurboTorqueTM connections and large diameter drill pipe that delivers hydraulic performance superior to standard sizes. Drill collars are used in the drilling process to place weight on the drill bit for better control and penetration. Drill collars are located directly above the drill bit and are manufactured from a solid steel bar to provide necessary weight. Heavyweight drill pipe is a thick walled seamless tubular product that is less rigid than a drill collar. Heavyweight drill pipe provides a gradual transition between the heavier drill collar and the lighter drill pipe. We also provide subs, pup joints (short and odd sized tubular products) and other drill stem accessories. These products all perform special functions within the drill string as part of the drilling process. NOV IntelliServ. NOV IntelliServ is a joint venture between the Company and Schlumberger, Ltd. in which the Company holds a 55% interest and maintains operational control. NOV IntelliServ provides wellbore data transmission services that enable high speed communication up and down the drill string throughout drilling and completion operations that are undertaken during the construction of oil and gas wells. NOV IntelliServs core product, The IntelliServ Broadband Network, was commercialized in February 2006 and incorporates various proprietary mechanical and electrical components into our premium drilling tubulars to enable data transmission rates that are currently up to 20,000 times faster than mud pulse, the current industry standard. The IntelliServ Broadband Network also permits virtually unlimited real time actuation of drilling tools and sensors at the bottom of the drill string, a process that conventionally requires the time consuming return of tools to the surface. NOV IntelliServ offers its products and services on a rental basis to oil and gas operators. Voest Alpine Tubulars (VAT). VAT is a joint venture between the Company and the Austrian based Voestalpine Group. The Company has a 50.01% investment in the joint venture which is located in Kindberg, Austria. VAT owns a tubular mill with an annual capacity of approximately 380,000 metric tons and is the primary supplier of green tubes for our U.S. based production. In addition to producing green tubes, VAT produces seamless tubular products for the OCTG market and non OCTG products used in the automotive, petrochemical, construction, mining, tunneling and transportation industries. Fiberglass Composite Tubulars. When compared to conventional carbon steel and even corrosion resistant alloys, resin impregnated fiberglass and other modern plastic composites often exhibit superior resistance to corrosion. Some producers manage the corrosive fluids sometimes found in oil and gas fields by utilizing composite or fiberglass tubing, casing and line pipe in the operations of their fields. In 1997, the Company acquired Fiber Glass Systems, a leading provider of high pressure fiberglass tubulars used in oilfield applications, to further serve the tubular corrosion prevention needs of its customers. Fiber Glass Systems has manufactured fiberglass pipe since 1968 under the name Star, and was the first manufacturer of high pressure fiberglass pipe to be licensed by the API in 1992. Through acquisitions and investments in technologies, the Company has extended its fiberglass and composite tubing offering into industrial and marine applications, in addition to its oilfield market. Coiled Tubing. Coiled tubing provides a number of significant functional advantages over the principal alternatives of conventional drill pipe and workover pipe. Coiled tubing allows faster tripping, since the coiled tubing can be reeled quickly on and off a drum and in and out of a wellbore. In addition, the small size of the coiled tubing unit compared to an average workover rig or drilling rig reduces preparation time at the well site. Coiled tubing permits a variety of workover and other operations to be performed without having to pull the existing production tubing from the well and allows ease of operation in horizontal or highly deviated wells. Thus, operations using coiled tubing can be performed much more quickly and, in many instances, at a significantly lower cost. Finally, use of coiled tubing generally allows continuous production of the well, eliminating the need to temporarily stop the flow of hydrocarbons. As a result, the economics of a workover are improved because the well can continue to produce hydrocarbons and thus produce revenues while the well treatments are occurring. Continuous production also reduces the risk of formation damage which can 11 Table of Contents occur when the flow of fluids is stopped or isolated. Under normal operating conditions, the coiled tubing string must be replaced every three to four months. NOV designs, manufactures, and sells coiled tubing under the Quality Tubing brand name at its mill in Houston, Texas. NOV Downhole. The NOV Downhole business unit combines a wide array of drilling and intervention tool product lines with the drill bit, coring services, borehole enlargement and drilling dynamics/drilling optimization service lines previously consolidated within the ReedHycalog business unit of Grant Prideco. The broad spectrum of bottom hole assembly (BHA) components offered by NOV Downhole is unique within the industry and is the result of National Oilwell Varcos strategic consolidation of several key acquisitions, including: NQL Energy Services, Inc., a leading manufacturer and provider of downhole drilling tools; Gammaloy Holdings, L.P., a manufacturer and provider of non magnetic drill collars and other related products; and the ReedHycalog, Corion, and Andergauge business units of Grant Prideco, a global leader in the design, manufacture and provision of drill bits, variable gauge stabilizers, hydraulically and mechanically actuated under reamers, specialty coring services and downhole vibration mitigation services. NOV Downhole manufactures fixed cutter and roller cone drill bits and services its customer base through a technical sales and marketing network in virtually every significant oil and gas producing region of the world. It provides fixed cutter bit technology under various brand names including TReX, Raptor, SystemMatched and Rotary Steerable. One of its most significant fixed cutter drill bit innovations is the TReX, Raptor, and Duraforce family of cutter technologies which significantly increase abrasion resistance (wear life) without sacrificing impact resistance (toughness). This technology provides a diamond surface that maintains a sharp, low wear cutting edge that produces drilling results that exceed conventional standards for polycrystalline diamond (PDC) bit performance. The Company produces roller cone bits for a wide variety of oil and gas drilling applications. Roller cone bits consist of three rotating cones that have cutting teeth, which penetrate the formation through a crushing action as the cones rotate in conjunction with the rotation of the drill pipe. This cutting mechanism, while less efficient than fixed cutter bits, is more versatile in harder formations, or where the geology is changing. We manufacture roller cone bits with milled teeth and with tungsten carbide insert teeth, which have a longer life in harder formations. We also manufacture a unique patented line of bits using a powder metal forging technology sold under the brand TuffCutter. We market our roller cone products and technology globally under various brand names including RockForce, Titan and TuffCutter. NOV Downhole designs, manufacturers and services a wide array of downhole motors used in straight hole, directional, slim hole, and coiled tubing drilling applications. These motors are sold or leased under the NOV Downhole brand name. The Company also maintains a wide variety of motor power sections, including its proprietary PowerPlus and HemiDril rotors and stators which it incorporates into its own motors as well as sells to third parties. Downhole drilling motors utilize hydraulic horsepower from the drilling fluid pumped down the drill stem to develop torque at the bit. Motors are capable of achieving higher rotary velocities than can generally be achieved using conventional surface rotary equipment. Motors are often used in conjunction with high speed PDC bits to improve rates of penetration. The NOV Downhole group also manufactures and sells drilling jars and fishing tools, which are marketed under the GriffithTM and Bowen brand names. Drilling jars are placed in the drill string, where they can be used to generate a sudden, jarring motion to free the drill string should it become stuck in the wellbore during the drilling process. This jarring motion is generated using hydraulic and or mechanical force provided at the surface. In the event that a portion of the drill string becomes stuck and cannot be jarred loose, fishing tools are run into the wellbore on the end of the drill string to retrieve the portion that is stuck. Through its Coring Services business line, NOV Downhole offers coring solutions that enable the extraction of actual rock samples from a drilled well bore and allow geologists to examine the formations at the surface. One of the coring services utilized is NOVs unique Corion Express system which allows the customer to drill and core a well without tripping pipe. Corion Express utilizes wireline retrievable drilling and coring elements which allow the system to transform from a drilling assembly to a coring assembly and also to wireline retrieve the geological core. This capability enables customers to save significant time and expense during the drilling and coring process. NOV Downhole offers a wide variety of industry leading technologies to enable customers to enlarge the diameter of a drilled hole below a restriction (typically a casing string) via its Borehole Enlargement business line. Borehole enlargement services are typically utilized in deep water drilling where customers wish to maximize the size of each successive casing string in order to preserve a relatively large completion hole size through which to produce hydrocarbons from the reservoir. Borehole enlargement is also employed where customers wish to reduce the fluid velocity and pressure within the well bore annulus to reduce the risk of formation erosion or accidental fracture. NOV Borehole Enlargement provides bi centered drill bits, expandable reamers (marketed under the AnderReamer brand name) and associated equipment along with well site service technicians who deliver 24 hour support during hole enlargement operations. 12 Table of Contents NOV Downhole offers drilling optimization services via its Advanced Drilling Solutions (ADS) business line. ADS services incorporate various downhole vibration measurement and mitigation tools along with dedicated, highly trained personnel who interpret such data and provide drilling parameter guidance intended to improve drilling efficiency and reduce drilling risk.

Stock Rig Technology December 2009 Stork MSW Stock Petroleum Services Supplies December 2009 The Company paid an aggregate purchase price of $573 million, net of cash acquired for acquisitions and outside investments in 2009. In September 2009, the Company sold 45 percent of certain of its IntelliServ operations and created the IntelliServ Joint Venture (IntelliServ). IntelliServ provides drilling technology that enables downhole drilling conditions to be measured, evaluated and monitored. Seasonal Nature of the Companys Business Historically, the level of some of the Companys businesses has followed seasonal trends to some degree. In general the Rig Technology group has not experienced significant seasonal fluctuation although orders for new equipment may be modestly affected by holiday schedules. There can be no guarantee that seasonal effects will not influence future sales in this segment. In Canada, the Petroleum Services Supplies segment has typically realized high first quarter activity levels, as operators take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. In past years, certain Canadian businesses within Petroleum Services Supplies and Distribution Services have declined during the second quarter due to warming weather conditions which resulted in thawing, softer ground, difficulty accessing drill sites, and road bans that curtailed drilling activity (Canadian Breakup). However, these businesses have typically rebounded in the third and fourth quarter. Petroleum Services Supplies activity in both the U.S. and Canada sometimes increases during the third quarter and then peaks in the fourth quarter as operators spend the remaining drilling and or production capital budgets for that year. Petroleum Services Supplies revenues in the Rocky Mountain region sometimes decline in the late fourth quarter or early first quarter due to harsh winter weather. The segments fiberglass and composite tubulars business in China has typically declined in the first quarter due to the impact of weather on manufacturing and installation operations, and due to business slowdowns associated with the Chinese New Year. The Company anticipates that the seasonal trends described above will continue. However, there can be no guarantee that spending by the Companys customers will continue to follow patterns seen in the past or that spending by other customers will remain the same as in prior years. Marketing Distribution Network Substantially all of our Rig Technology capital equipment and spare parts sales, and a large portion of our smaller pumps and parts sales, are made through our direct sales force and distribution service centers. Sales to foreign oil companies are often made with or through agent or representative arrangements. Products within our Petroleum Service Supplies segment are rented and sold worldwide through our own sales force and through commissioned representatives. Distribution Services sales are made directly through our network of distribution service centers. The Rig Technology segments customers include drilling contractors, shipyards and other rig fabricators, well servicing companies, pressure pumpers, national oil companies, major and independent oil and gas companies, supply stores, and pipe running service providers. Demand for its products is strongly dependent upon capital spending plans by oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, and the level of oil and gas well drilling activity. Rig Technology purchases can represent significant capital expenditures, and are often sold as part of a rig fabrication or major rig refurbishment package. Sometimes these packages cover multiple rigs, and often the Company bids jointly with other related product and services providers, such as rig fabrication yards and rig design firms. The Petroleum Services Supplies groups customers for tubular services include major and independent oil and gas companies, national oil companies, oilfield equipment and product distributors and manufacturers, drilling and workover contractors, oilfield service companies, pressure pumpers, pipeline operators, pipe mills, manufacturers and processors, and other industrial companies. Certain tubular inspection and tubular coating products and services often are incorporated as a part of a tubular package sold by tubular supply stores to end users. The Company primarily has direct operations in the international marketplace, but operates through agents in certain markets. 15 Table of Contents The Petroleum Services Supplies groups customers for drilling services are predominantly major and independent oil and gas companies, national oil companies, drilling contractors, well servicing companies, providers of drilling fluids, and other oilfield service companies. This group operates sales and distribution facilities at strategic locations worldwide to service areas with high drilling activity. Strategically located service and engineering facilities provide specialty repair and maintenance services to customers. Sales of capital equipment are sometimes made through rig fabricators, and often are bid as part of a rig fabrication package or rig refurbishment package. Sometimes these packages cover multiple rigs, and often the Company bids jointly with other related service providers. Distribution Services sales are made through our network of distribution service centers. Customers for our products and services include drilling and other service contractors, exploration and production companies, supply companies and nationally owned or controlled drilling and production companies. The Companys foreign operations, which include significant operations in Canada, Europe, the Far East, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including foreign currency exchange risks and uncertain political and economic environments, which may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation. Government owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which the Company operates have adopted policies (or are subject to governmental policies) giving preference to the purchase of goods and services from companies that are majority owned by local nationals. As a result of such policies, the Company relies on joint ventures, license arrangements and other business combinations with local nationals in these countries. In addition, political considerations may disrupt the commercial relationship between the Company and such government owned petroleum companies. Although the Company has not experienced any material problems in foreign countries arising from nationalistic policies, political instability, economic instability or currency restrictions, there can be no assurance that such a problem will not arise in the future. As discussed in the Executive Summary, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency in 2010. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding geographic revenue information. Research and New Product Development and Intellectual Property The Company believes that it has been a leader in the development of new technology and equipment to enhance the safety and productivity of drilling and well servicing processes and that its sales and earnings have been dependent, in part, upon the successful introduction of new or improved products. Through its internal development programs and certain acquisitions, the Company has assembled an extensive array of technologies protected by a substantial number of trade and service marks, patents, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights. As of December 31, 2009, the Company held a substantial number of United States patents and had several patent applications pending. Expiration dates of such patents range from 2010 to 2027. As of this date, the Company also had foreign patents and patent applications pending relating to inventions covered by the United States patents. Additionally, the Company maintains a substantial number of trade and service marks and maintains a number of trade secrets. Although the Company believes that this intellectual property has value, competitive products with different designs have been successfully developed and marketed by others. The Company considers the quality and timely delivery of its products, the service it provides to its customers and the technical knowledge and skills of its personnel to be as important as its intellectual property in its ability to compete. While the Company stresses the importance of its research and development programs, the technical challenges and market uncertainties associated with the development and successful introduction of new products are such that there can be no assurance that the Company will realize future revenues from new products. 16 Table of Contents Engineering and Manufacturing The manufacturing processes for the Companys products generally consist of machining, welding and fabrication, heat treating, assembly of manufactured and purchased components and testing. Most equipment is manufactured primarily from alloy steel, and the availability and price of alloy steel castings, forgings, purchased components and bar stock is critical to the production and timing of shipments. Primary manufacturing facilities for the Rig Technology segment are located in Houston, Galena Park, Sugar Land, Conroe, Cedar Park, Anderson, Fort Worth and Pampa, Texas; Duncan, Oklahoma; Orange, California; Edmonton, Canada; Aberdeen, Scotland; Kristiansand, and Stavanger, Norway; Etten Leur and Groot Ammers, the Netherlands; Carquefou, France; Singapore; Lanzhou and Shanghai, China; Jebel Ali, Dubai; and Ulsan, South Korea. The Companys Petroleum Services Supplies segment manufactures or assembles the equipment and products which it rents and sells to customers, and which it uses in providing services. Downhole tools are manufactured at facilities in Houston, Texas; Manchester, England; Jebel Ali, Dubai; and Singapore. Drill Bits are manufactured at facilities in Conroe, Texas; Stonehouse, U.K; and Jurong, Singapore. Drill Stem technology development and drill pipe are manufactured at facilities in Navasota, Texas; Veracruz, Mexico; Jurong, Singapore; and Baimi Town, Jiangyan and Jiangsu, China facilities. Solids control equipment and screens are manufactured at facilities in Houston and Conroe, Texas; New Iberia, Louisiana; Aberdeen, Scotland; Trinidad; Shah Alum and Puncak Alam, Malaysia; and Macae, Brazil. Pumps are manufactured at facilities in Houston, Odessa and Marble Falls, Texas; McAlester and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Manchester and Newcastle, England; Melbourne, Australia; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The IntelliServ Group manufactures or assembles equipment in Provo, Utah. The group manufactures tubular inspection equipment and tools at its Houston, Texas facility for resale, and renovates and repairs equipment at its manufacturing facilities in Houston, Texas; Celle, Germany; Singapore; and Aberdeen, Scotland. Fiberglass and composite tubulars and fittings are manufactured at facilities in San Antonio, Texas; Little Rock, Arkansas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Wichita, Kansas; and Harbin and Suzhou, China facilities, while tubular coatings are manufactured in its Houston, Texas facility, or through restricted sale agreements with third party manufacturers. Certain of the Companys manufacturing facilities and certain of the Companys products have various certifications, including, ISO 9001, API, APEX and ASME. Raw Materials The Company believes that materials and components used in its servicing and manufacturing operations and purchased for sales are generally available from multiple sources. The prices paid by the Company for its raw materials may be affected by, among other things, energy, steel and other commodity prices; tariffs and duties on imported materials; and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company experienced higher steel prices and greater difficulty securing necessary steel supplies in 2004 and 2005 than it experienced during the preceding several years. In 2006 and 2007, the price for mild steel and standard grades stabilized while specialty alloy prices continued to rise driven primarily by escalation in the price of the alloying agents. However, toward the end of 2007, the Company began to see price escalations in all grades of steel that continued into 2008. During 2008, steel prices stabilized and the Company began to experience some declines in steel prices late in 2008 and throughout 2009. The Company has generally been successful in its effort to mitigate the financial impact of higher raw materials costs on its operations by applying surcharges to and adjusting prices on the products it sells. Furthermore, NOV continued to expand its supply base in 2006, 2007 and 2008 throughout the world to address our customers needs. The steel price declines that NOV experienced in later 2008 continued through most of 2009. In the later part of 2009 the rate of decline slowed due to some offsetting pressure from increased costs of alloying agents. In 2010, NOV expects flat to slight increases in steel pricing. Higher prices and lower availability of steel and other raw material the Company uses in its business may adversely impact future periods. Backlog The Company monitors its backlog of orders within its Rig Technology segment to guide its planning. Backlog includes orders greater than $250,000 for most items and orders for wireline units in excess of $75,000, and which require more than three months to manufacture and deliver. Backlog measurements are made on the basis of written orders which are firm, but may be defaulted upon by the customer in some instances. Most require reimbursement to the Company for costs incurred in such an event. There can be no assurance that the backlog amounts will ultimately be realized as revenue, or that the Company will earn a profit on backlog work. Our backlog for equipment at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $6.4 billion, $11.1 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively. Employees At December 31, 2009, the Company had a total of 36,802 employees, of which 4,379 were temporary employees. Approximately 104 employees in the Companys fiberglass tubulars plant in Little Rock, Arkansas, and 110 employees of the Companys downhole tools product line in Houston and Conroe, Texas, are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Additionally, certain of the Companys employees in various foreign locations are subject to collective bargaining agreements. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to other information contained or incorporated by reference herein. Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We are dependent upon the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which is volatile. The oil and gas industry historically has experienced significant volatility. Demand for our services and products depends primarily upon the number of oil rigs in operation, the number of oil and gas wells being drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of these wells, the volume of production, the number of well completions, capital expenditures of other oilfield service companies and the level of workover activity. Drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time, particularly in the United States and Canada. The willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital expenditures to explore for and produce oil and natural gas and the willingness of oilfield service companies to invest in capital equipment will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including: the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to maintain price stability through voluntary production limits, the level of production by non OPEC countries and worldwide demand for oil and gas; level of production from known reserves; cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas; level of drilling activity and drilling rig dayrates; worldwide economic activity; national government political requirements; development of alternate energy sources; and environmental regulations. If there is a significant reduction in demand for drilling services, in cash flows of drilling contractors, well servicing companies, or production companies or in drilling or well servicing rig utilization rates, then demand for the products and services of the Company will decline. Volatile oil and gas prices affect demand for our products. Oil and gas prices have been volatile since 1972. In general, oil prices approximated $18 $22 per barrel from 1991 through 1997, experienced a decline into the low teens in 1998 and 1999, and have generally ranged between $25 $100 per barrel since 2000. In 2008, oil prices were extremely volatile oil prices rose to $147 per barrel in July 2008 only to fall into the $35 $45 per barrel range in December 2008. In 2009, oil prices continued to be volatile, rising from the $30 per barrel range to the $70 per barrel range during the year. Spot gas prices generally ranged between $1.80 $2.60 per mmbtu of gas from 1991 through 1999 then experienced severe spikes into the $10 range in 2001 and 2003. Absent occasional spikes and dips due to imbalances in supply and demand, prices have generally ranged between $4.50 $12.00 per mmbtu during 2005 2008. In 2009, spot gas prices continued to be volatile, dropping into the $3 per mmbtu range during the year. Expectations for future oil and gas prices cause many shifts in the strategies and expenditure levels of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, particularly with respect to decisions to purchase major capital equipment of the type we manufacture. Oil and gas prices, which are determined by the marketplace, may fall below a range that is acceptable to our customers, which could reduce demand for our products. 18 Table of Contents Worldwide financial and credit crisis could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. Events in 2008 and 2009 constrained credit markets and sparked a serious global banking crisis. The slowdown in worldwide economic activity caused by the global recession reduced demand for energy and resulted in lower oil and natural gas prices. Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will reduce oil and natural gas drilling activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services, which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, many of our customers access the credit markets to finance their oil and natural gas drilling activity. If the recent crisis and recession reduce the availability of credit to our customers, they may reduce their drilling and production expenditures, thereby decreasing demand for our products and services. Any such reduction in spending by our customers could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. There are risks associated with certain contracts for our drilling equipment. As of December 31, 2009, we had a backlog of approximately $6.4 billion of drilling equipment to be manufactured, assembled, tested and delivered by our Rig Technology group. The following factors, in addition to others not listed, could reduce our margins on these contracts, adversely affect our position in the market or subject us to contractual penalties: our failure to adequately estimate costs for making this drilling equipment; our inability to deliver equipment that meets contracted technical requirements; our inability to maintain our quality standards during the design and manufacturing process; our inability to secure parts made by third party vendors at reasonable costs and within required timeframes; unexpected increases in the costs of raw materials; and our inability to manage unexpected delays due to weather, shipyard access, labor shortages or other factors beyond our control. The Companys existing contracts for rig equipment generally carry significant down payment and progress billing terms favorable to the ultimate completion of these projects and do not allow customers to cancel projects for convenience. However, unfavorable market conditions or financial difficulties experienced by our customers may result in cancellation of contracts or the delay or abandonment of projects. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Competition in our industry could ultimately lead to lower revenues and earnings. The oilfield products and services industry is highly competitive. We compete with national, regional and foreign competitors in each of our current major product lines. Certain of these competitors may have greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than us, and may be in a better competitive position. The following competitive actions can each affect our revenues and earnings: price changes; new product and technology introductions; and improvements in availability and delivery. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions and government owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which we operate have adopted policies or regulations which may give local nationals in these countries competitive advantages. Competition in our industry could lead to lower revenues and earnings. We have aggressively expanded our businesses and intend to maintain an aggressive growth strategy. We have aggressively expanded and grown our businesses during the past several years, through acquisitions and investment in internal growth. We anticipate that we will continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy but we cannot assure you that attractive acquisitions will be available to us at reasonable prices or at all. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will successfully integrate the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own or that our management will be able to manage effectively the increased size of the Company or operate any new lines of business. Any inability on the part of management to integrate and manage acquired businesses and their assumed liabilities could adversely affect our business and financial performance. In addition, we may need to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this financing 19 Table of Contents on terms acceptable to us or at all. Future acquisitions may result in increased depreciation and amortization expense, increased interest expense, increased financial leverage or decreased operating income for the Company, any of which could cause our business to suffer. Our operating results have fluctuated during recent years and these fluctuations may continue. We have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results in the past. We cannot assure that we will realize earnings growth or that earnings in any particular quarter will not fall short of either a prior fiscal quarter or investors expectations. The following factors, in addition to others not listed, may affect our quarterly operating results in the future: fluctuations in the oil and gas industry; competition; the ability to service the debt obligations of the Company; the ability to identify strategic acquisitions at reasonable prices; the ability to manage and control operating costs of the Company; fluctuations in political and economic conditions in the United States and abroad; and the ability to protect our intellectual property rights. There are risks associated with our presence in international markets, including political or economic instability, currency restrictions, and trade and economic sanctions. Approximately 73% of our revenues in 2009 were derived from operations outside the United States (based on revenue destination). Our foreign operations include significant operations in Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America and other international markets. Our revenues and operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including uncertain political and economic environments, which may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation. Government owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which we operate have adopted policies, or are subject to governmental policies, giving preference to the purchase of goods and services from companies that are majority owned by local nationals. As a result of these policies, we may rely on joint ventures, license arrangements and other business combinations with local nationals in these countries. In addition, political considerations may disrupt the commercial relationships between us and government owned petroleum companies. Our operations outside the United States could also expose us to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of trading sanctions laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other federal statutes. Under trading sanctions laws, the DOJ may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs. If any of the risks described above materialize, it could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. We have received federal grand jury subpoenas and subsequent inquiries from governmental agencies requesting records related to our compliance with export trade laws and regulations. We have cooperated fully with agents from the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in responding to the inquiries, and we have conducted our own internal review of this matter. At the conclusion of our internal review in the fourth quarter of 2009, we identified possible areas of concern and discussed these areas of concern with the relevant agencies. We are currently negotiating a potential resolution with the agencies involved related to these matters. We currently anticipate that any administrative fine or penalty agreed to as part of a resolution would be within established accruals, and would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. To the extent a resolution is not negotiated as anticipated, we cannot predict the timing or effect that any resulting government actions may have on our financial position or results of operations. As a result of our internal review and in an effort to prevent any future compliance issues of this nature, we have reviewed and are in the process of enhancing our compliance procedures and training. 20 Table of Contents The results of our operations are subject to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We earn revenues, pay expenses and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Canadian dollar, the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Norwegian krone and the South Korean won. Approximately 73% of our 2009 revenue was derived from sales outside the United States. Because our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Thus, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which our operations are conducted will affect our revenues and operating income. Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. We use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our net exposure to currency exchange fluctuations. We had forward contracts with a notional amount of $2,850 million (with a fair value of $49 million) as of December 31, 2009 to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We are also subject to risks that the counterparties to these contracts fail to meet the terms of our foreign currency contracts. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates would not affect our financial results. An impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets could reduce our earnings. The Company has approximately $5.5 billion of goodwill and $0.6 billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of December 31, 2009. Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include (but are not limited to) a significant reduction in worldwide oil and gas prices or drilling; a significant reduction in profitability or cash flow of oil and gas companies or drilling contractors; a significant reduction in worldwide well remediation activity; a significant reduction in capital investment by other oilfield service companies; or a significant increase in worldwide inventories of oil or gas. The timing and magnitude of any goodwill impairment charge, which could be material, would depend on the timing and severity of the event or events triggering the charge and would require a high degree of management judgment. If we were to determine that any of our remaining balance of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets was impaired, we would record an immediate charge to earnings with a corresponding reduction in stockholders equity; resulting in an increase in balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. See additional discussion on Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets in Critical Accounting Estimates of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with any of the numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies that govern environmental protection, zoning and other matters applicable to our businesses. Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies governing environmental protection, zoning and other matters. These laws and regulations have changed frequently in the past and it is reasonable to expect additional changes in the future. If existing regulatory requirements change, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures. We cannot assure you that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations. Governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Under these circumstances, we might be required to reduce or cease operations or conduct site remediation or other corrective action which could adversely impact our operations and financial condition. Our businesses expose us to potential environmental liability. Our businesses expose us to the risk that harmful substances may escape into the environment, which could result in: personal injury or loss of life; severe damage to or destruction of property; or environmental damage and suspension of operations. 21 Table of Contents Our current and past activities, as well as the activities of our former divisions and subsidiaries, could result in our facing substantial environmental, regulatory and other liabilities. These could include the costs of cleanup of contaminated sites and site closure obligations. These liabilities could also be imposed on the basis of one or more of the following theories: negligence; strict liability; breach of contract with customers; or as a result of our contractual agreement to indemnify our customers in the normal course of business, which is normally the case. We may not have adequate insurance for potential environmental liabilities. While we maintain liability insurance, this insurance is subject to coverage limits. In addition, certain policies do not provide coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination. We face the following risks with respect to our insurance coverage: we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms; we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance; our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies; or the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits. Even a partially uninsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could increase our operating costs or reduce demand for our products. Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. The adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases, including the imposition of fees or taxes, could adversely impact our operations and financial condition. The U.S. Congress is currently working on legislation to control and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States, which includes establishing cap and trade programs. In addition to the pending climate legislation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed regulations that would require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities, and may issue final rules this year. These changes in the legal and regulatory environment could reduce oil and natural gas drilling activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services, which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. The Company had revenues of 16.6% of total revenue from one of its customers for the year ended December 31, 2009. The loss of this customer or a significant reduction in its purchases could adversely affect our future revenues and earnings. 22 Table of Contents GLOSSARY OF OILFIELD TERMS (Sources: Company management; A Dictionary for the Petroleum Industry, The University of Texas at Austin, 2001.) API Abbr: American Petroleum Institute Annular Blowout Preventer A large valve, usually installed above the ram blowout preventers, that forms a seal in the annular space between the pipe and the wellbore or, if no pipe is present, in the wellbore itself. Annulus The open space around pipe in a wellbore through which fluids may pass. Automatic Pipe Handling Systems (Automatic Pipe Racker) A device used on a drilling rig to automatically remove and insert drill stem components from and into the hole. It replaces the need for a person to be in the derrick or mast when tripping pipe into or out of the hole. Automatic Roughneck A large, self contained pipe handling machine used by drilling crew members to make up and break out tubulars. The device combines a spinning wrench, torque wrench, and backup wrenches. Beam pump Surface pump that raise and lowers sucker rods continually, so as to operate a downhole pump. Bit The cutting or boring element used in drilling oil and gas wells. The bit consists of a cutting element and a circulating element. The cutting element is steel teeth, tungsten carbide buttons, industrial diamonds, or polycrystalline diamonds (PDCs). These teeth, buttons, or diamonds penetrate and gouge or scrape the formation to remove it. The circulating element permits the passage of drilling fluid and utilizes the hydraulic force of the fluid stream to improve drilling rates. In rotary drilling, several drill collars are joined to the bottom end of the drill pipe column, and the bit is attached to the end of the drill collars. Drill collars provide weight on the bit to keep it in firm contact with the bottom of the hole. Most bits used in rotary drilling are roller cone bits, but diamond bits are also used extensively. Blowout An uncontrolled flow of gas, oil or other well fluids into the atmosphere. A blowout, or gusher, occurs when formation pressure exceeds the pressure applied to it by the column of drilling fluid. A kick warns of an impending blowout. Blowout Preventer (BOP) Series of valves installed at the wellhead while drilling to prevent the escape of pressurized fluids. Blowout Preventer (BOP) Stack The assembly of well control equipment including preventers, spools, valves, and nipples connected to the top of the wellhead. Closed Loop Drilling Systems A solids control system in which the drilling mud is reconditioned and recycled through the drilling process on the rig itself. Coiled Tubing A continuous string of flexible steel tubing, often hundreds or thousands of feet long, that is wound onto a reel, often dozens of feet in diameter. The reel is an integral part of the coiled tubing unit, which consists of several devices that ensure the tubing can be safely and efficiently inserted into the well from the surface. Because tubing can be lowered into a well without having to make up joints of tubing, running coiled tubing into the well is faster and less expensive than running conventional tubing. Rapid advances in the use of coiled tubing make it a popular way in which to run tubing into and out of a well. Also called reeled tubing. Cuttings Fragments of rock dislodged by the bit and brought to the surface in the drilling mud. Washed and dried cutting samples are analyzed by geologist to obtain information about the formations drilled. Directional Well Well drilled in an orientation other than vertical in order to access broader portions of the formation. 23 Table of Contents Drawworks The hoisting mechanism on a drilling rig. It is essentially a large winch that spools off or takes in the drilling line and thus raises or lowers the drill stem and bit. Drill Pipe Elevator (Elevator) On conventional rotary rigs and top drive rigs, hinged steel devices with manual operating handles that crew members latch onto a tool joint (or a sub). Since the elevators are directly connected to the traveling block, or to the integrated traveling block in the top drive, when the driller raises or lowers the block or the top drive unit, the drill pipe is also raised or lowered. Drilling jars A percussion tool operated manually or hydraulically to deliver a heavy downward blow to free a stuck drill stem. Drilling mud A specially compounded liquid circulated through the wellbore during rotary drilling operations. Drilling riser A conduit used in offshore drilling through which the drill bit and other tools are passed from the rig on the waters surface to the sea floor. Drill stem All members in the assembly used for rotary drilling from the swivel to the bit, including the Kelly, the drill pipe and tool joints, the drill collars, the stabilizers, and various specialty items. Formation A bed or deposit composed throughout of substantially the same kind of rock; often a lithologic unit. Each formation is given a name, frequently as a result of the study of the formation outcrop at the surface and sometimes based on fossils found in the formation. FPSO A Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel used to receive hydrocarbons from subsea wells, and then produce and store the hydrocarbons until they can be offloaded to a tanker or pipeline. Hardbanding A special wear resistant material often applied to tool joints to prevent abrasive wear to the area when the pipe is being rotated downhole. Hydraulic Fracturing The process of creating fractures in a formation by pumping fluids, at high pressures, into the reservoir, which allows or enhances the flow of hydrocarbons. Iron Roughneck A floor mounted combination of a spinning wrench and a torque wrench. The Iron Roughneck moves into position hydraulically and eliminates the manual handling involved with suspended individual tools. Jack up rig A mobile bottom supported offshore drilling structure with columnar or open truss legs that support the deck and hull. When positioned over the drilling site, the bottoms of the legs penetrate the seafloor. Jar A mechanical device placed near the top of the drill stem which allows the driller to strike a very heavy blow upward or downward on stuck pipe. Joint 1. In drilling, a single length (from 16 feet to 45 feet, or 5 meters to 14.5 meters, depending on its range length) of drill pipe, drill collar, casing or tubing that has threaded connections at both ends. Several joints screwed together constitute a stand of pipe. 2. In pipelining, a single length (usually 40 feet 12 meters) of pipe. 3. In sucker rod pumping, a single length of sucker rod that has threaded connections at both ends. 24 Table of Contents Kelly The heavy steel tubular device, four or six sided, suspended from the swivel through the rotary table and connected to the top joint of drill pipe to turn the drill stem as the rotary table returns. It has a bored passageway that permits fluid to be circulated into the drill stem and up the annulus, or vice versa. Kellys manufactured to API specifications are available only in four or six sided versions, are either 40 or 54 feet (12 to 16 meters) long, and have diameters as small as 2.5 inches (6 centimeters) and as large as 6 inches (15 centimeters). Kelly bushing A special device placed around the kelly that mates with the kelly flats and fits into the master bushing of the rotary table. The kelly bushing is designed so that the kelly is free to move up or down through it. The bottom of the bushing may be shaped to fit the opening in the master bushing or it may have pins that fit into the master bushing. In either case, when the kelly bushing is inserted into the master bushing and the master bushing is turned, the kelly bushing also turns. Since the kelly bushing fits onto the kelly, the kelly turns, and since the kelly is made up to the drill stem, the drill stem turns. Also called the drive bushing. Kelly spinner A pneumatically operated device mounted on top of the kelly that, when actuated, causes the kelly to turn or spin. It is useful when the kelly or a joint of pipe attached to it must be spun up, that is, rotated rapidly for being made up. Kick An entry of water, gas, oil, or other formation fluid into the wellbore during drilling. It occurs because the pressure exerted by the column of drilling fluid is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the formation drilled. If prompt action is not taken to control the kick, or kill the well, a blowout may occur. Making up 1. To assemble and join parts to form a complete unit (e.g., to make up a string of drill pipe). 2. To screw together two threaded pieces. Compare break out. 3. To mix or prepare (e.g., to make up a tank of mud). 4. To compensate for (e.g., to make up for lost time). Manual tongs (Tongs) The large wrenches used for turning when making up or breaking out drill pipe, casing, tubing, or other pipe; variously called casing tongs, pipe tongs, and so forth, according to the specific use. Power tongs or power wrenches are pneumatically or hydraulically operated tools that serve to spin the pipe up tight and, in some instances to apply the final makeup torque. Master bushing A device that fits into the rotary table to accommodate the slips and drive the kelly bushing so that the rotating motion of the rotary table can be transmitted to the kelly. Also called rotary bushing. Motion compensation equipment Any device (such as a bumper sub or heave compensator) that serves to maintain constant weight on the bit in spite of vertical motion of a floating offshore drilling rig. Mud pump A large, high pressure reciprocating pump used to circulate the mud on a drilling rig. Plug gauging The mechanical process of ensuring that the inside threads on a piece of drill pipe comply with API standards. Pressure control equipment Equipment used in: 1. The act of preventing the entry of formation fluids into a wellbore. 2. The act of controlling high pressures encountered in a well. Pressure pumping Pumping fluids into a well by applying pressure at the surface. Ram blowout preventer A blowout preventer that uses rams to seal off pressure on a hole that is with or without pipe. Also called a ram preventer. Ring gauging The mechanical process of ensuring that the outside threads on a piece of drill pipe comply with API standards. Riser A pipe through which liquids travel upward. 25 Table of Contents Riser pipe The pipe and special fitting used on floating offshore drilling rigs to established a seal between the top of the wellbore, which is on the ocean floor, and the drilling equipment located above the surface of the water. A riser pipe serves as a guide for the drill stem from the drilling vessel to the wellhead and as a conductor or drilling fluid from the well to the vessel. The riser consists of several sections of pipe and includes special devices to compensate for any movement of the drilling rig caused by waves. Also called marine riser pipe, riser joint. Rotary table The principal piece of equipment in the rotary table assembly; a turning device used to impart rotational power to the drill stem while permitting vertical movement of the pipe for rotary drilling. The master bushing fits inside the opening of the rotary table; it turns the kelly bushing, which permits vertical movement of the kelly while the stem is turning. Rotating blowout preventer (Rotating Head) A sealing device used to close off the annular space around the kelly in drilling with pressure at the surface, usually installed above the main blowout preventers. A rotating head makes it possible to drill ahead even when there is pressure in the annulus that the weight of the drilling fluid is not overcoming; the head prevents the well from blowing out. It is used mainly in the drilling of formations that have low permeability. The rate of penetration through such formations is usually rapid. Safety clamps A clamp placed very tightly around a drill collar that is suspended in the rotary table by drill collar slips. Should the slips fail, the clamp is too large to go through the opening in the rotary table and therefore prevents the drill collar string from falling into the hole. Also called drill collar clamp. Shaker See Shale Shaker Shale shaker A piece of drilling rig equipment that uses a vibrating screen to remove cuttings from the circulating fluid in rotary drilling operations. The size of the openings in the screen should be selected carefully to be the smallest size possible to allow 100 per cent flow of the fluid. Also called a shaker. Slim hole completions (Slim hole Drilling) Drilling in which the size of the hole is smaller than the conventional hole diameter for a given depth. This decrease in hole size enables the operator to run smaller casing, thereby lessening the cost of completion. Slips Wedge shaped pieces of metal with serrated inserts (dies) or other gripping elements, such as serrated buttons, that suspend the drill pipe or drill collars in the master bushing of the rotary table when it is necessary to disconnect the drill stem from the kelly or from the top drive units drive shaft. Rotary slips fit around the drill pipe and wedge against the master bushing to support the pipe. Drill collar slips fit around a drill collar and wedge against the master bushing to support the drill collar. Power slips are pneumatically or hydraulically actuated devices that allow the crew to dispense with the manual handling of slips when making a connection. Solids See Cuttings Spinning wrench Air powered or hydraulically powered wrench used to spin drill pipe in making or breaking connections. Spinning in The rapid turning of the drill stem when one length of pipe is being joined to another. Spinning out refers to separating the pipe. Stand The connected joints of pipe racked in the derrick or mast when making a trip. On a rig, the usual stand is about 90 feet (about 27 meters) long (three lengths of drill pipe screwed together), or a treble. String The entire length of casing, tubing, sucker rods, or drill pipe run into a hole. 26 Table of Contents Sucker rod A special steel pumping rod. Several rods screwed together make up the link between the pumping unit on the surface and the pump at the bottom of the well. Tensioner A system of devices installed on a floating offshore drilling rig to maintain a constant tension on the riser pipe, despite any vertical motion made by the rig. The guidelines must also be tensioned, so a separate tensioner system is provided for them. Thermal desorption The process of removing drilling mud from cuttings by applying heat directly to drill cuttings. Tiebacks (Subsea) A series of flowlines and pipes that connect numerous subsea wellheads to a single collection point. Top drive A device similar to a power swivel that is used in place of the rotary table to turn the drill stem. It also includes power tongs. Modern top drives combine the elevator, the tongs, the swivel, and the hook. Even though the rotary table assembly is not used to rotate the drill stem and bit, the top drive system retains it to provide a place to set the slips to suspend the drill stem when drilling stops. Torque wrench Spinning wrench with a gauge for measuring the amount of torque being applied to the connection. Trouble cost Costs incurred as a result of unanticipated complications while drilling a well. These costs are often referred to as contingency costs during the planning phase of a well. Well completion 1. The activities and methods of preparing a well for the production of oil and gas or for other purposes, such as injection; the method by which one or more flow paths for hydrocarbons are established between the reservoir and the surface. 2. The system of tubulars, packers, and other tools installed beneath the wellhead in the production casing; that is, the tool assembly that provides the hydrocarbon flow path or paths. Wellhead The termination point of a wellbore at surface level or subsea, often incorporating various valves and control instruments. Well stimulation Any of several operations used to increase the production of a well, such as acidizing or fracturing. Well workover The performance of one or more of a variety of remedial operations on a producing oil well to try to increase production. Examples of workover jobs are deepening, plugging back, pulling and resetting liners, and squeeze cementing. Wellbore A borehole; the hole drilled by the bit. A wellbore may have casing in it or it may be open (uncased); or part of it may be cased, and part of it may be open. Also called a borehole or hole. Wireline A slender, rodlike or threadlike piece of metal usually small in diameter, that is used for lowering special tools (such as logging sondes, perforating guns, and so forth) into the well. Also called slick line. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General Overview The Company is a leading worldwide provider of highly engineered drilling and well servicing equipment, products and services to the exploration and production segments of the oil and gas industry. With operations in over 825 locations across six continents, we design, manufacture and service a comprehensive line of drilling and well servicing equipment; sell and rent drilling motors, specialized downhole tools, and rig instrumentation; perform inspection and internal coating of oilfield tubular products; provide drill cuttings separation, management and disposal systems and services; provide expendables and spare parts used in conjunction with our large installed base of equipment; and provide supply chain management services through our distribution network. We also manufacture coiled tubing, manufacture high pressure fiberglass and composite tubing, and sell and rent advanced in line inspection equipment to makers of oil country tubular goods. We have a long tradition of pioneering innovations which improve the cost effectiveness, efficiency, safety, and environmental impact of oil and gas operations. Our revenues and operating results are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling and production activities and the profitability and cash flow of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, which in turn are affected by current and anticipated prices of oil and gas. Oil and gas prices have been and are likely to continue to be volatile. See Risk Factors. We conduct our operations through three business segments: Rig Technology, Petroleum Services Supplies and Distribution Services. See Item 1. Business for a discussion of each of these business segments. Operating Environment Overview Our results are dependent on, among other things, the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling, well remediation activity, the price of crude oil and natural gas, capital spending by other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors, and the worldwide oil and gas inventory levels. Key industry indicators for the past three years include the following: % % 2009 v 2009 v 2009* 2008* 2007* 2008 2007 Active Drilling Rigs: U.S. 1,086 1,878 1,767 (42.2 %) (38.5 %) Canada 221 379 344 (41.7 %) (35.8 %) International 997 1,079 1,005 (7.6 %) (0.8 %) Worldwide 2,304 3,336 3,116 (30.9 %) (26.1 %) West Texas Intermediate Crude Prices (per barrel) $ 61.65 $ 99.63 $ 72.33 (38.1 %) (14.8 %) Natural Gas Prices ($/mmbtu) $ 3.95 $ 8.86 $ 6.97 (55.4 %) (43.3 %) * Averages for the years indicated. See sources below. 34 Table of Contents The following table details the U.S., Canadian, and international rig activity and West Texas Intermediate Oil prices for the past nine quarters ended December 31, 2009 on a quarterly basis: Source: Rig count: Baker Hughes, Inc. (www.bakerhughes.com); West Texas Intermediate Crude Price: Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (www.eia.doe.gov). The average price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate Crude was $61.65 per barrel in 2009, a decrease of 38.1% over the average price for 2008 of $99.63 per barrel. Average natural gas prices were $3.95 per mmbtu, a decrease of 55.4% compared to the 2008 average of $8.86 per mmbtu. Lower oil prices led to reduced rig activity worldwide, decreasing 30.9% for the full year in 2009 compared to 2008. Average crude oil prices for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $76.06 per barrel and natural gas was $4.34 per mmbtu. At February 5, 2010, there were 1,335 rigs actively drilling in the U.S., compared to 1,189 rigs at December 31, 2009; an increase of 12.3% from year end 2009 levels. The price of oil and gas had dropped to $71.15 per barrel and $5.52 per mmbtu, respectively, at February 5, 2010 representing 10.4% (oil) and 5.2% (gas) declines from the end of 2009. 35 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY National Oilwell Varco produced $1.5 billion in net income or $3.52 per fully diluted share in 2009. Revenues of $12.7 billion declined five percent from 2008 as stated, but declined nine percent when including full year 2008 pro forma sales for Grant Prideco, which the Company acquired in April 2008. Operating profit was $2.3 billion in 2009, compared to $2.9 billion in 2008. Generally 2009 was a more challenging year than 2008, as a worldwide recession led to lower demand for oil and gas and lower commodity prices, which led in turn to lower oil and gas drilling activity. This development negatively affected many of our businesses, but was partly offset by results from our Rig Technology segment which carried a high level of contracted work into the year, and produced higher year over year revenues. Profitability was adversely affected by intangible asset impairment, transaction, voluntary early retirement and other restructuring charges in 2009 that totaled $234 million pre tax or $0.37 per dilutive share after tax. Excluding these items earnings would have been $3.89 per diluted share. For its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, National Oilwell Varco generated earnings of $394 million or $0.94 per fully diluted share, on revenues of $3.1 billion. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 revenue declined 18 percent and net income attributable to the Company declined 33 percent. Compared to the third quarter of 2009 revenue increased two percent and net income attributable to the Company increased two percent. Fourth quarter 2009 operating profit was $622 million or 19.8 percent of sales, compared to $618 million or 20.0 percent of sales in the third quarter of 2009, and $877 million or 23.0 percent of sales in the fourth quarter of 2008, excluding transaction and restructuring charges from all periods. Year over year quarterly declines across all segments were a result of lower activity and pricing in most oilfield markets. The modest sequential improvement in the fourth quarter of 2009 was driven by higher sequential activity in North American markets driving better results from the Companys Petroleum Services Supplies and Distribution Services segments, offset by slightly lower results from Rig Technology. Oil Gas Equipment and Services Market Worldwide developed economies turned down sharply late in 2008 as looming housing related asset write downs at major financial institutions paralyzed credit markets and sparked a serious global banking crisis. Major central banks have responded vigorously, but credit and financial markets have not yet fully recovered, and a credit driven worldwide economic recession deepened during the second quarter. Asset and commodity prices, including oil and gas prices, have declined sharply. After rising steadily for six years to peak at around $147 per barrel earlier in 2008, oil prices collapsed back to average $42.91 per barrel during the first quarter of 2009, but have been recovering steadily to average $76.06 per barrel during the fourth quarter of 2009. Higher oil and gas prices over the past several years led to high levels of exploration and development drilling in many oil and gas basins around the globe by 2008, but activity slowed sharply in 2009 with lower oil and gas prices and tightening credit availability. The count of rigs actively drilling in the U.S. as measured by Baker Hughes (a good measure of the level of oilfield activity and spending) peaked at 2,031 rigs in September 2008, but decreased to a low of 876 in June 2009. Rig count has increased to 1,335 in February 2010, and averaged 1,108 rigs during the fourth quarter of 2009. Many oil and gas operators reliant on external financing to fund their drilling programs significantly curtailed their drilling activity earlier in the year, but drilling appears to be recovering across North America as gas prices firmed above $4.00 per mmbtu (the fourth quarter average was $4.34 per mmbtu). Most international activity is driven by oil exploration and production by national oil companies, which has historically been less susceptible to short term commodity price swings, but the international rig count has exhibited modest declines nonetheless, falling from its September 2008 peak of 1,108 to 986 in September 2009, but recently climbing back to 1,047 in January 2010. During the year the Company saw its Petroleum Services Supplies and its Distribution Services margins affected most acutely by a drilling downturn, through both volume and price declines; nevertheless, both of these segments saw prices stabilize and revenues recover modestly from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. The Companys Rig Technology segment was less impacted through the year owing to its high level of contracted backlog and strong execution during the year. Recent downturns followed an extended period of high drilling activity which fueled strong demand for oilfield services between 2003 and 2008. Incremental drilling activity through the upswing shifted toward harsh environments, employing increasingly sophisticated technology to find and produce reserves. Higher utilization of drilling rigs tested the capability of the worlds fleet of rigs, much of which is old and of limited capability. Technology has advanced significantly since most of the existing rig fleet was built. The industry invested little during the late 1980s and 1990s on new drilling equipment, but drilling technology progressed steadily nonetheless, as the Company and its competitors continued to invest in new and better ways of drilling. As a consequence, the safety, reliability, and efficiency of new, modern rigs surpass the performance of most of the older rigs at work today. Drilling rigs are now being pushed to drill deeper wells, more complex wells, highly deviated wells and horizontal wells, tasks which require larger rigs with more capabilities. The drilling process effectively consumes the mechanical components of a rig, which wear out and need periodic repair or replacement. This process was accelerated by very high rig utilization and wellbore complexity. Drilling consumes rigs; more complex and challenging drilling consumes rigs faster. 36 Table of Contents The industry responded by launching many new rig construction projects since 2005 to: 1.) retool the existing fleet of jackup rigs (according to Offshore Data Services, 72 percent of the existing 457 jackup rigs are more than 25 years old); 2.) replace older mechanical and DC electric land rigs with improved AC power, electronic controls, automatic pipe handling and rapid rigup and rigdown technology; and 3.) build out additional deepwater floating drilling rigs, including semisubmersibles and drillships, to employ recent advancements in deepwater drilling to exploit unexplored deepwater basins. We believe that the newer rigs offer considerably higher efficiency, safety, and capability, and that many will effectively replace a portion of the existing fleet, and that declining dayrates may accelerate the retirement of older rigs. As a result of these trends the Companys Rig Technology segment grew its backlog of capital equipment orders from $0.9 billion at March 31, 2005, to $11.8 billion at September 30, 2008. However, as a result of the credit crisis and slowing drilling activity, orders have declined below amounts flowing out of backlog as revenue, causing the backlog to decline to $6.4 billion at December 31, 2009. The land rig backlog comprised 11 percent, and equipment destined for offshore operations comprised 89 percent of the total backlog as of December 31, 2009. Equipment destined for international markets totaled 92 percent of the backlog. The Company believes that its existing contracts for rig equipment are very strong in that they carry significant down payment and progress billing terms favorable to the ultimate completion of these projects, and generally do not allow customers to cancel projects for convenience. During 2009 the Company removed $259 million in discontinued orders on cancelled projects and project change orders requested by customers. We do not expect the credit crisis or softer market to result in additional material cancellation of contracts or abandonment of major projects; however, there can be no assurance that such discontinuance of projects will not occur. The Company had approximately $274 million of projects in its December 31, 2009 backlog that it considers at risk. Segment Performance Rig Technology generated a record $8.1 billion in revenue and $2.3 billion in operating profit in 2009, producing operating margins for the segment of 28.2 percent, excluding transaction and restructuring charges. The segment generated 55 percent operating profit leverage or flow through (the change in operating profit divided by the change in revenue period to period) on eight percent higher sales as compared to 2008, excluding charges. Revenue out of backlog of $6.2 billion increased 18 percent from the prior year. Execution of the backlog orders was very strong, which led to higher margin performance for the Rig Technology segment in the third quarter due to excellent cost control, deflation in certain inputs, greater experience building and commissioning rigs which enables better efficiencies, and somewhat better foreign currency exchange movements. As a result our estimated costs to complete projects declined steadily through 2009. As of December 31, 2009 the scheduled outflow of revenue from backlog is expected to be approximately $4.6 billion in 2010, and $1.5 billion for 2011, and $0.3 billion in 2012. From 2005 through the current quarter, the segment has delivered over 70 newly built offshore rigs. Aftermarket spare parts and services revenue was $1.4 billion in 2009 or 17 percent of total segment sales. The balance of Rig Technology revenues were smaller capital items which the Company does not book into its backlog. These items were adversely affected by lower purchases by many land contractors in view of markedly softer drilling demand during the year. Demand for offshore rigs and equipment is strongest in Brazil, owing to significant drilling equipment needs to develop new ultradeepwater discoveries, and the segment also continues to pursue a variety of new offshore rig, intervention vessel, FPSO and platform upgrade opportunities in other markets. However, tight credit markets and fewer committed term contracts for rigs by oil and gas companies as compared to market conditions in 2006 2008 are adversely affecting new orders. Demand for land rig and well stimulation equipment has also been very slow, except for the Middle East and certain Latin American markets, but resumed late in the year in the U.S. Additionally, demand for coiled tubing units and pressure pumping equipment for both North America and international markets also recovered late in the year. The Petroleum Services Supplies segment generated revenues of $3.7 billion and operating profit of $0.5 billion or 12.1 percent of sales in 2009, excluding impairment, transaction and restructuring charges. Revenues declined 29 percent from 2008, when including pro forma revenue for Grant Prideco, and decremental operating leverage or flow through was 55 percent from 2008, excluding charges, due to a high level of price discounting on most products and services through the year. Prices appeared to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2009, settling roughly 25 percent below peak pricing levels of 2008 (although some products and services are at greater, and some at lesser, levels of discounting). Sharply rising North American rig counts led to modestly tightening supplies of many of the segments products, which contributed to the stabilization. As working rigs were stacked during 2009 their owners tended to cannibalize consumables and smaller capital items from these rather than purchase goods from the Company. During the fourth quarter some of these rigs were restocked with new goods, which led to new orders for the Company and benefitted its fourth quarter results in North America. International demand remained somewhat stable, and did not turn down as sharply earlier in the year as gas driven North American drilling. Drill pipe sales remain challenged due to the large amount of idle drill pipe inventory remaining with drilling contractors. Nevertheless, drill pipe margins have remained good due to lower costs and a positive mix shift toward premium drill pipe, for new offshore rigs being delivered, and for complex horizontal and extended reach drilling programs onshore. We do not expect drill pipe demand to recover significantly until inventories are depleted through consumption, late in 2010 at the earliest. In total the Petroleum Services Supplies segment generated approximately 47 percent of its sales into North American markets, and 53 percent of its sales into international markets, during 2009. 37 Table of Contents The Distribution Services segment generated total sales of $1.4 billion in 2009, down 24 percent from 2008 sales. Operating profit excluding transaction and restructuring charges was $50 million or 3.7 percent of sales. Decremental operating leverage or flow through was 19 percent on the $422 million sales decline from the prior year, higher than the segments historical average, due largely to price discounting in North America, which comprised 70 percent of the segments revenue in 2009. The segments lower results were driven by a much lower level of drilling activity, which led to intense price pressure and lower volumes for the group. International results were generally much more stable in 2009 as compared to 2008, as higher sales of artificial lift products into Latin America helped offset declines elsewhere. The segment posted 8 percent higher quarterly sequential results in the fourth quarter of 2009 as the North American rig count moved up sharply and customers ordered MRO supplies for rigs going back to work. Specifically new unconventional shale gas fields in the Marcellus, Haynesville, Bakken and other areas led most of the recovery. Outlook The credit market downturn, global recession, and lower commodity prices presented significant challenges to our business in 2009. Consequently we remain cautious in our outlook for 2010, but we believe we are seeing signs of stabilization in many of our markets, and are encouraged by limited demand growth in North America seen late in the year. Order levels for new drilling rigs declined significantly in 2009 as compared to 2008, but we continue to bid a number of large projects, including up to 28 new offshore floating rigs to be built in Brazil. We are hopeful that these will translate into more orders during the coming year, assuming, among other things, that rig dayrates generally hold up well; that commodity prices remain high; and that broad economic conditions do not deteriorate further. North American land gas drilling activity, particularly by independent gas producers reliant on external financing, fell sharply early in 2009, but we believe better commodity prices are leading to recovery as we enter 2010. Our outlook for international markets, which are more driven by national oil company activity and are historically less volatile, remains good owing to high and stable oil price levels established through the second half of 2009. Our outlook for the Companys Petroleum Services Supplies segment and Distribution Services segment remains closely tied to the rig count, particularly in North America. If the rig count continues to increase we expect these segments to benefit from higher demand for the services, consumables and capital items they supply. The Rig Technology segment was less affected by the downturn during 2009 due to the strength of its backlog, but as the backlog has declined we expect to see revenues and margins decline through 2010 as well. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced a currency devaluation which included a two tier exchange rate system. The Company has net assets employed in Venezuela of approximately $80 million, and generated revenue and operating profit of approximately $75 million and $10 million, respectively, in 2009. We expect to incur a pre tax charge between $20 million and $30 million in the first quarter of 2010 related to the impact of the currency devaluation and changes to social regulations impacting our operations in Venezuela. The Company believes it is well positioned to continue to manage through this downturn, and should benefit from its strong balance sheet and capitalization, access to credit, and a high level of contracted orders which are expected to continue to generate earnings in the coming year. The Company has a long history of cost control and downsizing in response to depressed market conditions, and of executing strategic acquisitions during difficult periods. Such a period may present opportunities to the Company to effect new organic growth and acquisition initiatives, and we remain hopeful that a downturn will generate new opportunities. 38 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 The following table summarizes the Companys revenue and operating profit by operating segment in 2009 and 2008. The actual results include results from Grant Prideco operations from the acquisition date of April 21, 2008 (in millions): Years Ended December 31, Variance 2009 2008 $ % Revenue: Rig Technology $ 8,093 $ 7,528 $ 565 7.5 % Petroleum Services Supplies 3,745 4,651 (906 ) (19.5 %) Distribution Services 1,350 1,772 (422 ) (23.8 %) Eliminations (476 ) (520 ) 44 (8.5 %) Total Revenue $ 12,712 $ 13,431 $ (719 ) (5.4 %) Operating Profit: Rig Technology $ 2,283 $ 1,970 $ 313 15.9 % Petroleum Services Supplies 301 1,044 (743 ) (71.2 %) Distribution Services 50 130 (80 ) (61.5 %) Unallocated expenses and eliminations (319 ) (226 ) (93 ) 41.2 % Total Operating Profit $ 2,315 $ 2,918 $ (603 ) (20.7 %) Operating Profit %: Rig Technology 28.2 % 26.2 % Petroleum Services Supplies 8.0 % 22.4 % Distribution Services 3.7 % 7.3 % Total Operating Profit % 18.2 % 21.7 % Rig Technology Rig Technology revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $8,093 million, an increase of $565 million (7.5%) compared to 2008. Revenue out of backlog increased $934 million or 18% from 2008 due to an increase in the number of large rig projects delivered this year. Non backlog revenue decreased $369 million or 17% compared to 2008, largely due to lower spare parts and capital equipment sales as North American land drillers and pressure pumpers decreased their capital spending in 2009. Operating profit from Rig Technology was $2,283 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $313 million (15.9%) over the same period of 2008. Operating profit percentage increased to 28.2%, up from 26.2% in 2008 primarily due to the increased manufacturing efficiencies and revision of cost estimates on large rig projects as a result of favorable pricing from vendors. The Rig Technology group monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when we receive a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $6.4 billion at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $4.7 billion (42.3%) from backlog of $11.1 billion at December 31, 2008. Approximately $4.6 billion of the current backlog is expected to be delivered in 2010. Petroleum Services Supplies Revenue from Petroleum Services Supplies was $3,745 million for 2009 compared to $4,651 million for 2008, a decrease of $906 million (19.5%). The decrease was primarily attributable to a 42% decline in North American average rig count activity in 2009 compared to 2008. Operating profit from Petroleum Services Supplies was $301 million for 2009 compared to $1,044 million for 2008, a decrease of $743 million (71.2%). Operating profit percentage decreased to 8.0% down from 22.4% in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to reduced North American rig count activity combined with strong price competition. In addition, a $147 million impairment charge was incurred on the carrying value of a trade name associated with this segment in the second quarter of 2009. 39 Table of Contents Distribution Services Revenue from Distribution Services totaled $1,350 million for 2009, a decrease of $422 million (23.8%) from 2008. The decrease in revenue is mainly concentrated in the North American region as average drilling activity declined 42% in 2009 compared to the prior year. Operating profit decreased in 2009 to $50 million compared to $130 million in 2008. Operating profit percentage decreased to 3.7% in 2009 from 7.3% in 2008 as a result of strong price competition and volume declines as North American rig activity declined. Unallocated expenses and eliminations Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $319 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $226 million for 2008. The increase in unallocated expenses and eliminations was primarily due to the voluntary retirement costs of $46 million. Acquisition costs also contributed to the increase from 2008. Interest and financial costs Interest and financial costs were $53 million for 2009 compared to $67 million for 2008. The decrease in interest and financial costs were primarily a direct result of the repayment of borrowings on the Companys credit facility used to purchase Grant Prideco, the repayment of the Companys 7.5% Senior Notes and the repayment of a portion of the Companys 6.125% Senior Notes. These repayments occurred during 2008 causing lower debt levels in 2009. Equity Income in Unconsolidated Affiliate Equity income in unconsolidated affiliate was $47 million for 2009 compared to $42 million for 2008 and was related to the April 21, 2008 acquisition of Grant Prideco. The income was related to the equity earnings from the Companys 50.01% investment in Voest Alpine Tubulars (VAT) located in Kindberg, Austria. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net was expense, net of $110 million in 2009 compared to income, net of $23 million in 2008. The 2009 expense was primarily due to a net foreign exchange loss of $79 million, as compared to a net foreign exchange gain of $50 million in 2008. The 2009 foreign exchange losses were primarily due to adjustments of our hedge positions as a result of the current economic environment and the strengthening of the Euro, the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone compared to the U.S. dollar. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Rates. Provision for income taxes The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 33.3% compared to 33.5% for 2008. The tax rate includes $21 million of additional tax provision recognized in the second quarter 2009 on prior year income in Norway. These additional taxes resulted from foreign currency gains on dollar denominated accounts that were realized for Norwegian tax purposes. The Company expects its income tax rate to be in the 30% to 32% range in 2010. 40 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 The following table summarizes the Companys revenue and operating profit by operating segment in 2008 and 2007. The actual results include results from Grant Prideco operations from the acquisition date of April 21, 2008 (in millions): Years Ended December 31, Variance 2008 2007 $ % Revenue: Rig Technology $ 7,528 $ 5,745 $ 1,783 31.0 % Petroleum Services Supplies 4,651 3,061 1,590 51.9 % Distribution Services 1,772 1,424 348 24.4 % Eliminations (520 ) (441 ) (79 ) 17.9 % Total Revenue $ 13,431 $ 9,789 $ 3,642 37.2 % Operating Profit: Rig Technology $ 1,970 $ 1,394 $ 576 41.3 % Petroleum Services Supplies 1,044 732 312 42.6 % Distribution Services 130 94 36 38.3 % Unallocated expenses and eliminations (226 ) (176 ) (50 ) 28.4 % Total Operating Profit $ 2,918 $ 2,044 $ 874 42.8 % Operating Profit %: Rig Technology 26.2 % 24.3 % Petroleum Services Supplies 22.4 % 23.9 % Distribution Services 7.3 % 6.6 % Total Operating Profit % 21.7 % 20.9 % Rig Technology Rig Technology revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $7,528 million, an increase of $1,783 million (31.0%) compared to 2007. Revenue out of backlog increased $1,217 million or 29.8% from 2007 due to the growing market for capital equipment, as evidenced by backlog growth during the first three quarters of 2008. The increase in orders and backlog resulted from continued capital investments by drilling contractors in 2008, primarily related to the international offshore market. Non backlog revenue increased $567 million or 34.1% over 2007, largely due to increased spare parts sales and service revenues related to the increased drilling activity during the year. Operating profit from Rig Technology was $1,970 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $576 million (41.3%) over the same period of 2007. The increase in operating profit was largely due to the increased activity discussed above as well as improved pricing on large rig contracts and aftermarket products. The Rig Technology group monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when we receive a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $11.1 billion at December 31, 2008, an increase of $2.1 billion (23.3%) over backlog of $9.0 billion at December 31, 2007. Petroleum Services Supplies Revenue from Petroleum Services Supplies was $4,651 million for 2008 compared to $3,061 million for 2007, an increase of $1,590 million (51.9%). The increase was mostly attributable to the acquisition of Grant Prideco which contributed sales of $1,435 million since the acquisition date of April 21, 2008. Higher demand for most of the products and services offered by the segment also contributed to the higher revenue compared to 2007. Rig count in North America and international markets during 2008 were up 6.9% and 7.3%, respectively, compared to 2007 averages, prompting higher demand from our services group. Operating profit from Petroleum Services Supplies was $1,044 million for 2008 compared to $732 million for 2007, an increase of $312 million (42.6%). Grant Prideco contributed $297 million of operating profit since April 21, 2008. Included in the Grant Prideco operating profit was $89 million of expense recorded in cost of revenue that resulted from the fair value step up of inventory as part of the purchase accounting valuation of Grant Prideco. The increase was also attributable to higher profitability across most product lines. 41 Table of Contents Distribution Services Revenue from Distribution Services totaled $1,772 million in 2008, an increase of $348 million (24.4%) from the prior period. The number of drilling rigs actively searching for oil and gas is a key metric for this business segment. Worldwide rig count increased 7.1% in 2008 compared to 2007, with increases of 10.3%, 7.3% and 6.3% in Canada, international and the U.S. rig activity, respectively. The Companys Distribution Services segment continued efforts to expand in international markets resulted in a 25% increase in international revenue. The expansion primarily consisted of opening rig stores or facilities that maintain levels of consumables used on rigs, in centrally located areas. In addition, the Company has begun to open stores on individual rigs. After opening its first rig store in 2007, the Company opened eight additional stores during 2008 continuing the efforts to expand its presence both in the U.S. and internationally. Operating income increased in 2008 to $130 million compared to $94 million in 2007. Margins increased slightly to 7.3% of revenue in 2008 compared to 6.6% of revenue in 2007. The increase in margin was primarily due to the cost reduction actions taken in Canada to offset the weakening demand seen in the later part of 2007 combined with the increase in profit margins from international locations. Unallocated expenses and eliminations Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $226 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $176 million for 2007. The increase in unallocated expenses and eliminations was primarily due to greater inter segment profit eliminations and greater stock based compensation expense. The stock based compensation expense was $61 million and $43 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2008 results also included $11 million of integration costs related to the 2008 acquisition of Grant Prideco. Interest and financial costs Interest and financial costs were $67 million for 2008 compared to $50 million for 2007. The increase was primarily due to the borrowings related to the merger with Grant Prideco. Equity Income in Unconsolidated Affiliate Equity income in unconsolidated affiliate was $42 million for 2008 and was related to the April 21, 2008 acquisition of Grant Prideco. The income was related to the equity earnings from the Companys 50.01% investment in Voest Alpine Tubulars (VAT) located in Kindberg, Austria. The Companys investment in VAT is accounted for under the equity method of accounting due to the minority owner having substantive participating rights. Step up depreciation and amortization of $8 million was recorded in 2008 related to VAT and charges of $11 million were recorded related to inventory step up. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net was an income, net of $23 million and an expense of $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. The 2008 income was primarily due to a net foreign exchange gain which was $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The 2008 foreign exchange gains were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone compared to the U.S. dollar. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Rates. Provision for income taxes The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.5% compared to 33.3% for 2007. The 2008 rate reflects increasing benefits in the U.S. from the tax incentive for manufacturing activities and a higher percentage of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. This was partially offset by additional tax provisions related to the Companys decision to repatriate earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries during the year and net higher tax expense in Norway related to movement in exchange rates after the change of the functional currency to the U.S. dollar. The net additional tax expense in Norway included a $46 million charge resulting from realized foreign exchange gains on U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities. This was partially offset by a $30 million benefit for the same period, which was reported as provision for income tax, from the remeasurement into U.S. dollars of foreign currency denominated deferred tax assets and liabilities in the balance sheet. 42 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2009, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2,622 million, and total debt of $883 million. At December 31, 2008, cash and cash equivalents were $1,543 million and total debt was $874 million. A portion of the consolidated cash balances are maintained in accounts in various foreign subsidiaries and, if such amounts were transferred among countries or repatriated to the U.S., such amounts may be subject to additional tax obligations. The Companys outstanding debt at December 31, 2009 consisted of $200 million of 5.65% Senior Notes due 2012, $200 million of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2011, $150 million of 6.5% Senior Notes due 2011, $150 million of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2012, $151 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2015, and other debt of $32 million. The Company had $2,073 million of additional outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2009, primarily in Norway, that are essentially under various bilateral committed letter of credit facilities. Other letters of credit are issued as bid bonds and performance bonds. The Senior Notes contain reporting covenants and the credit facility contains a financial covenant regarding maximum debt to capitalization. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2009. There were no borrowings against the Companys unsecured credit facility, and there were $588 million in outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility, resulting in $1,412 million of funds available under the Companys unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2009. The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the periods presented (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,095 $ 2,294 $ 1,188 Net cash used in investing activities (552 ) (2,473 ) (575 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (491 ) (74 ) 150 Operating Activities Net cash flow provided by operating activities in 2009 decreased $199 million to $2,095 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $2,294 million in the same period of 2008. Before changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, cash was provided by operations primarily through net income of $1,473 million plus non cash charges of $704 million and dividends from unconsolidated affiliates of $86 million less $47 million in equity income from the Companys unconsolidated affiliate. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, used cash of $22 million during 2009, compared to $147 million used during 2008. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in 2009 was $552 million compared to net cash used in investing of $2,473 million for the same period of 2008. The primary reason for the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2009 related to a decrease in size of business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, to approximately $573 million compared to $3,008 million used in 2008 which included the purchase of the business and operating assets of Grant Prideco. Sale of equity interest provided $251 million of cash in 2009 compared to business divestitures of $801 million received in 2008 related to the disposition of certain Grant Prideco tubular businesses. In addition, the Company used $250 million for capital expenditures in 2009, compared to $379 million in 2008, received $19 million less in dividends from its unconsolidated affiliate compared to 2008, and included $86 million of the dividends from unconsolidated affiliate received in 2009 in operating activities. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities in 2009 was $491 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $74 million for the same period of 2008. The cash used in financing activities in 2009 primarily related to $460 million in cash dividends paid during the last month of 2009. In addition, cash used in financing activities in 2009 related to $47 million cash payments on debt primarily acquired in 2009 acquisitions, offset by cash proceeds from borrowings in the amount of $7 million as well as exercised stock options and excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options in the amount of $9 million. The borrowings and payments of debt in 2008 primarily relates to the financing of the Grant Prideco acquisition. For 2009, the Company used its cash on hand to fund its acquisitions. 43 Table of Contents The effect of the change in exchange rates on cash flows was a positive $27 million and a negative $46 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. We believe cash on hand, cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund operations, working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and financing obligations. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $1,412 million of available funds under its revolving credit facility. We also believe increases in capital expenditures caused by any need to increase manufacturing capacity can be funded from operations or through existing available debt financing. A summary of the Companys outstanding contractual obligations at December 31, 2009 is as follows (in millions): Payment Due by Period Less than After Total 1Year 1 3Years 4 5Years 5Years Contractual Obligations: Total debt $ 883 $ 7 $ 717 $ 6 $ 153 Operating leases 553 122 156 96 179 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,436 $ 129 $ 873 $ 102 $ 332 Commercial Commitments: Standby letters of credit $ 2,661 $ 1,762 $ 721 $ 176 $ 2 As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $58 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. We intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates, but the timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted. We expect to fund future cash acquisitions and capital spending primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings, including the unborrowed portion of the credit facility or new debt issuances, but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions. There can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us. Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing the financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition under long term construction contracts; allowance for doubtful accounts; inventory reserves; impairments of long lived assets (excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets); goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable. The combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material. Revenue Recognition under Long term Construction Contracts The Company uses the percentage of completion method to account for certain long term construction contracts in the Rig Technology group. These long term construction contracts include the following characteristics: the contracts include custom designs for customer specific applications; the structural design is unique and requires significant engineering efforts; and construction projects often have progress payments. 44 Table of Contents This method requires the Company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project, progress against the project schedule and the estimated completion date, all of which impact the amount of revenue and gross margin the Company recognizes in each reporting period. The Company prepares detailed cost to complete estimates at the beginning of each project, taking into account all factors considered likely to affect gross margin. Significant projects and their related costs and profit margins are updated and reviewed at least quarterly by senior management. Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include shipyard access, weather, production efficiencies, availability and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents and other factors as mentioned in Risk Factors. These factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the Companys estimates and materially impact the Companys future reported earnings. Historically, the Companys estimates have been reasonably dependable regarding the recognition of revenues and gross profits on percentage of completion contracts. Based upon an analysis of percentage of completion contracts for all open contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007, adjustments (representing the differences between the estimated and actual results) to all outstanding contracts resulted in net changes to gross profit margins of 1% ($53 million on $5.4 billion of outstanding contracts) and 0.8% ($31 million on $3.8 billion of outstanding contracts), respectively. While the Company believes that its estimates on outstanding contracts at December 31, 2009 and in future periods will continue to be reasonably dependable under percentage of completion accounting, the factors identified in the preceding paragraph could result in significant adjustments in future periods. The Company has recorded revenue on outstanding contracts (on a contract to date basis) of $8.6 billion at December 31, 2009. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The determination of the collectability of amounts due from customer accounts requires the Company to make judgments regarding future events and trends. Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on a continuous process of assessing the Companys portfolio on an individual customer basis taking into account current market conditions and trends. This process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, and financial condition of the Companys customers. Based on a review of these factors, the Company will establish or adjust allowances for specific customers. A substantial portion of the Companys revenues come from international oil companies, international shipyards, international oilfield service companies, and government owned or government controlled oil companies. Therefore, the Company has significant receivables in many foreign jurisdictions. If worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions deteriorate, the creditworthiness of the Companys customers could also deteriorate and they may be unable to pay these receivables, and additional allowances could be required. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, allowance for bad debts totaled $95 million and $73 million, or 4.3% and 2.3% of gross accounts receivable, respectively. Historically, the Companys charge offs and provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts have been immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. However, because of the risk factors mentioned above, changes in our estimates could become material in future periods. Inventory Reserves Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The Company determines reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on hand, assumptions about future demand and market conditions, and estimates about potential alternative uses, which are usually limited. The Companys inventory consists of specialized spare parts, work in process, and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the Companys large installed base of specialized equipment used throughout the oilfield. Customers rely on the Company to stock these specialized items to ensure that their equipment can be repaired and serviced in a timely manner. The Companys estimated carrying value of inventory therefore depends upon demand driven by oil and gas drilling and well remediation activity, which depends in turn upon oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, available financing for the Companys customers, political stability in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, inventory reserves totaled $206 million and $123 million, or 5.9% and 3.1% of gross inventory, respectively. While inventory reserves and accruals have not had a material impact on the Companys financial results for the periods covered in this report, changes in worldwide oil and gas activity, or the development of new technologies which make older drilling technologies obsolete, could require the Company to record additional allowances to reduce the value of its inventory. Such changes in our estimates could be material under weaker market conditions or outlook. 45 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived Assets (Excluding Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets) Long lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and identified intangible assets, comprise a significant amount of the Companys total assets. The Company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation and amortization methods and estimated useful lives. The carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable. We estimate the fair value of these intangible and fixed assets using an income approach. This requires the Company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. These forecasts require assumptions about demand for the Companys products and services, future market conditions and technological developments. The forecasts are dependent upon assumptions regarding oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, available financing for the Companys customers, political stability in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our income forecast as well as our weighted average cost of capital, both key assumptions used in our calculation. Changes to these assumptions, including, but not limited to: further sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts, further collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas, significant additional deterioration of external financing for our customers, higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity, or any other significant adverse economic news could require a provision for impairment in a future period. Due to further significant declines in the Companys stock price and oil and gas commodity prices, coupled with unprecedented turbulence in the credit markets, the Company determined a triggering event occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. The Company performed an impairment analysis at December 31, 2008 which did not result in an impairment charge. Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets The Company has approximately $5.5 billion of goodwill and $0.6 billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of December 31, 2009. Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include, but not limited to: further sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts, further collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas, significant additional deterioration of external financing for our customers, higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity. The annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each year. Based on its analysis, the Company did not report any impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. As described below, the Company concluded that an indicator of impairment occurred in the second quarter of 2009 and updated its impairment testing at June 30, 2009. Based on its updated analysis, the Company concluded that it did not incur an impairment of goodwill for the period ended June 30, 2009. However, based on the Companys indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of 2009, the Company concluded that it incurred an impairment charge to certain indefinite lived intangible assets of $147 million at June 30, 2009. The $147 million impairment charge is included in the Companys consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, the worldwide average rig count was 2,009 rigs, down 41% from the fourth quarter 2008 average of 3,395 and down 25% from the first quarter 2009 average of 2,681. The second quarter 2009 average rig count represented the lowest quarterly average in the past six years. In addition, the Companys updated forecast was behind the Companys previous forecast completed at the beginning of 2009. While operating profit for the first quarter of 2009 was in line with the Companys first quarter 2009 operating profit forecast, the Companys consolidated operating profit for the second quarter of 2009 was below its second quarter 2009 forecast. As a result of the substantial decline in the worldwide rig count, and the decline in actual/forecasted results compared to the original 2009 forecast, the Company concluded that events or circumstances had occurred indicating that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired as described under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other. Therefore, the Company performed its interim impairment test of goodwill for all its reporting units at the end of the second quarter of 2009. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of that reporting unit as a whole. Fair value of the reporting units is determined in accordance with ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures using significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. These inputs are based on internal management estimates, forecasts and judgments, using a combination of three methods: discounted cash flow, comparable companies, and representative transactions. While the Company primarily uses the discounted cash flow method to assess fair value, the Company uses the comparable companies and representative transaction methods to validate the discounted cash flow analysis and further support managements expectations, where possible. 46 Table of Contents The discounted cash flow is based on managements short term and long term forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit. The two main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment, which bear the risk of change and could impact the Companys goodwill impairment analysis, include the cash flow from operations from each of the Companys individual business units and the weighted average cost of capital. The starting point for each of the reporting units cash flow from operations is the detailed annual plan or updated forecast. The detailed planning and forecasting process takes into consideration a multitude of factors including worldwide rig activity, inflationary forces, pricing strategies, customer analysis, operational issues, competitor analysis, capital spending requirements, working capital needs, customer needs to replace aging equipment, increased complexity of drilling, new technology, and existing backlog among other items which impact the individual reporting unit projections. Cash flows beyond the specific operating plans were estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporated historical and forecasted financial cyclical trends for each reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit changes are a short term or long term trend. Projections for the remainder of 2009 also reflected declines compared to the original 2009 annual forecast. The Company updated its 2009 operating forecast, long term forecast, and discounted cash flows based on this information. The goodwill impairment analysis that we performed during the second quarter of 2009 did not result in goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2009. Other indefinite lived intangible assets, representing trade names management intends to use indefinitely, were valued using significant unobservable inputs (level 3) and are tested for impairment using the Relief from Royalty Method, a form of the Income Approach. An impairment is measured and recognized based on the amount the book value of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds its estimated fair value as of the date of the impairment test. Included in the impairment test are assumptions, for each trade name, regarding the related revenue streams attributable to the trade names which are determined consistent with the forecasting process described above, the royalty rate, and the discount rate applied. Based on the Companys indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of 2009, the Company incurred an impairment charge of $147 million in the Petroleum Services Supplies segment related to a partial impairment of the Companys Grant Prideco trade name. The impairment charge was primarily the result of the substantial decline in worldwide rig counts through June 2009, declines in forecasts in rig activity for the remainder of 2009, 2010, and 2011 compared to rig count forecast at the beginning of 2009 and a decline in the revenue forecast for the drill pipe business unit for the remainder of 2009, 2010, and 2011. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company further updated its impairment testing using current operating forecasts and discounted cash flows. In the third and fourth quarters of 2009, both rig activity and commodity prices began to increase. Rig count increased 4% to an average of 2,130 in the third quarter and increased another 13% to an average of 2,397 in the fourth quarter. Average West Texas Intermediate Crude prices reached $76.06 in the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of 28% from an average of $59.44 in the second quarter of 2009. In addition, by the end of the fourth quarter, average natural gas prices increased to $4.34, a 17% increase from the second quarter 2009 average of $3.71. The impairment analysis that we performed during the fourth quarter of 2009 resulted in no impairment of the Companys goodwill and no additional impairment for the Companys other indefinite lived intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2009. Along with the normal impairment analysis, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis on the projected results, the goodwill and the other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis assuming revenue for each individual reporting unit for goodwill and each individual indefinite lived intangible asset decreased an additional 20% from the current projections for 2010, 2011 and 2012, while holding all other factors constant and no impairment was identified. Additionally, if the Company were to increase its discount rate 100 basis points, while keeping all other assumptions constant, there would be no impairments in any of the goodwill associated with the Companys reporting units or any of the Companys indefinite lived intangible assets. While the Company does not believe that these events (20% drop in additional revenue for the next three years or 100 basis point increases in weighted average costs of capital) or changes are likely to occur, it is reasonably possible these events could transpire if market conditions worsen and if the market fails to continue to recover in 2010 and or 2011. Any significant changes to these assumptions and factors could have a material impact on the Companys goodwill impairment analysis. Inherent in our projections are key assumptions relative to how long the current downward cycle might last. Service and Product Warranties The Company provides service and warranty policies on certain of its products. The Company accrues liabilities under service and warranty policies based upon specific claims and a review of historical warranty and service claim experience in accordance with ASC Topic 450 Contingencies (ASC Topic 450). Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience change. In addition, the Company incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues and accrues for them when they are encountered. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, service and product warranties totaled $217 million and $114 million, respectively. 47 Table of Contents Income Taxes The Company is a U.S. registered company and is subject to income taxes in the U.S. The Company operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. Income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates of the countries in which the Company operates and income is earned. The Companys annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income, statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The determination and evaluation of the annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. It requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of income, deductions and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or the Companys level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could impact the tax liability in any given year. The Company also operates in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the pricing of transactions between related parties are open to interpretation, which could potentially result in aggressive tax authorities asserting additional tax liabilities with no offsetting tax recovery in other countries. The Company maintains liabilities for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation. The annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that the Company considers appropriate, as well as related interest. Tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing and certain operating expenses that may not be deductible in foreign jurisdictions. These exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means. The Company is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions which may result in proposed assessments. The Company believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures under the guidance in ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes (ASC Topic 740). However, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The Company reviews these liabilities quarterly and to the extent audits or other events result in an adjustment to the liability accrued for a prior year, the effect will be recognized in the period of the event. The Company currently has recorded valuation allowances that the Company intends to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in the Companys valuation allowances. The realization of remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that the Company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings. The Company has not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested. Should the Company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries, the Company may be required to record additional taxes. Unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries were $2,764 million and $2,255 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company makes an annual determination whether to permanently reinvest these earnings. If, as a result of these reassessments, the Company distributes these earnings in the future, additional tax liability would result, offset by any available foreign tax credits. The Company does not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability, if any, is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated. These include, among others, the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities; the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process; the impartiality of the local courts; and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce, or fail to produce, an offsetting tax change in other countries. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In April 2009 the FASB issued ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC Topic 805). ASC Topic 805 amends the provisions for the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosures for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations. ASC Topic 805 is effective for contingent assets and contingent liabilities acquired in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company expects ASC Topic 805 will have a future impact on its consolidated financial statements, but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature, term and size of the acquired contingencies. In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments (ASC Topic 825). ASC Topic 825 extends the annual disclosure requirements regarding the fair value of financial instruments to interim financial statements of publicly traded companies. ASC Topic 825 is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. On June 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 825. There was no significant impact to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements from the adoption of ASC Topic 825. 48 Table of Contents In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events (ASC Topic 855). ASC Topic 855 requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. ASC Topic 855 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ending after June 15, 2009. On June 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 855. There was no significant impact to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements from the adoption of ASC Topic 855. In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (ASC Topic 105). The ASC is now the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. On the effective date, ASC Topic 105 superseded all then existing non SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other non grandfathered non SEC accounting literature not included in the ASC has become non authoritative. ASC Topic 105 became effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. Forward Looking Statements Some of the information in this document contains, or has incorporated by reference, forward looking statements. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements typically are identified by use of terms such as may, will, expect, anticipate, estimate, and similar words, although some forward looking statements are expressed differently. All statements herein regarding expected merger synergies are forward looking statements. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from results anticipated in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in oil and gas prices, customer demand for our products and worldwide economic activity. You should also consider carefully the statements under Risk Factors which address additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward looking statements. Given these uncertainties, current or prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any such factors or forward looking statements to reflect future events or developments. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Additional information concerning each of these matters follows: Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We have extensive operations in foreign countries. The net assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, although such fluctuations generally do not affect income since their functional currency is typically the local currency. These operations also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency, which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company reported foreign currency gains (losses) of ($79) million, $50 million, and ($7) million, respectively. The gains and losses are primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and in 2009 adjustments to our hedged positions as a result of the current economic environment. Strengthening of currencies against the U.S. dollar may create losses in future periods to the extent we maintain net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the countries using the local currency as their functional currency. Some of our revenues in foreign countries are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those U.S. dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency. Similarly some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, but have associated U.S. dollar costs, which also give rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure. In order to mitigate that risk, we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. The following table details the Companys foreign currency exchange risk grouped by functional currency and their expected maturity periods as of December 31, 2009 (in millions except for rates): As of December 31, 2009 December 31, Functional Currency 2010 2011 2012 Total 2008 CAD Buy USD/Sell CAD: Notional amount to buy (in Canadian dollars) 291 291 527 Average CAD to USD contract rate 1.0418 1.0418 1.1843 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 2 2 14 Sell USD/Buy CAD: Notional amount to sell (in Canadian dollars) 69 69 241 Average CAD to USD contract rate 1.1109 1.1109 1.1196 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 4 4 (18 ) EUR Buy USD/Sell EUR: Notional amount to buy (in euros) 98 98 11 Average USD to EUR contract rate 1.4356 1.4356 1.4397 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars Sell USD/Buy EUR: Notional amount to buy (in euros) 90 1 91 245 Average USD to EUR contract rate 1.3892 1.4324 1.3896 1.3986 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 4 4 1 KRW Sell EUR/Buy KRW: Notional amount to buy (in South Korean won) 4,777 273 5,050 Average KRW to EUR contract rate 1.633 1.743 1.6390 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 50 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009 December 31, Functional Currency 2010 2011 2012 Total 2008 Sell USD/Buy KRW: Notional amount to buy (in South Korean won) 88,183 61,779 3,264 153,226 Average KRW to USD contract rate 1.019 1.084 1.118 1.0460 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars (12 ) (6 ) (18 ) GBP Buy USD/Sell GBP: Notional amount to buy (in British Pounds Sterling) 11 11 Average USD to GBP contract rate 1.5880 1.5880 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars Sell USD/Buy GBP: Notional amount to buy (in British Pounds Sterling) 2 2 34 Average USD to GBP contract rate 1.5313 1.5313 1.5647 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars (4 ) USD Buy DKK/Sell USD: Notional amount to buy (in U.S. dollars) 44 44 47 Average DKK to USD contract rate 5.1219 5.1219 5.4968 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars (1 ) (1 ) 2 Buy EUR/Sell USD: Notional amount to buy (in U.S. dollars) 374 8 382 749 Average USD to EUR contract rate 1.4588 1.4150 1.4578 1.3791 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars (7 ) (7 ) 14 Buy GBP/Sell USD: Notional amount to buy (in U.S. dollars) 76 76 108 Average USD to GBP contract rate 1.6348 1.6348 1.5623 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars (2 ) (2 ) (8 ) Buy NOK/Sell USD: Notional amount to buy (in U.S. dollars) 783 311 1,094 1,325 Average NOK to USD contract rate 6.2161 6.2541 6.2269 6.5338 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 49 18 67 (101 ) Sell DKK/Buy USD: Notional amount to buy (in U.S. dollars) 6 6 Average DKK to USD contract rate 5.0009 5.0009 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars Sell EUR/Buy USD: Notional amount to sell (in U.S. dollars) 53 3 56 76 Average USD to EUR contract rate 1.4444 1.2715 1.4324 1.3777 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars (2 ) Sell NOK/Buy USD: Notional amount to sell (in U.S. dollars) 408 408 589 Average NOK to USD contract rate 5.8307 5.8307 5.8647 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 104 Other Currencies Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 1 (1 ) Total Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 38 11 49 2 The Company had other financial market risk sensitive instruments denominated in foreign currencies totaling $75 million as of December 31, 2009 excluding trade receivables and payables, which approximate fair value. These market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances and overdraft facilities. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on these financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect net income by $5 million. 51 Table of Contents The counterparties to forward contracts are major financial institutions. The credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis. In the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract, our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential. We assess the functional currencies of our operating units to ensure that the appropriate currencies are utilized in accordance with the guidance of ASC Topic 830 Foreign Currency Matters. Effective January 1, 2008, we changed the functional currency of our Rig Technology unit in Norway from the Norwegian krone to the U.S. dollar to more appropriately reflect the primary economic environment in which they operate. This change was precipitated by significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances, including: the increased order rate for large drilling platforms and components technology, the use of our Norway unit as our preferred project manager of these projects, increasing revenue and cost base in U.S. dollars, and the implementation of an international cash pool denominated in U.S. dollars. As a Norwegian krone functional unit, Norway was subject to increasing foreign currency exchange risk as a result of these changes in its economic environment and was dependent upon significant hedging transactions to offset its non functional currency positions. At December 31, 2007, our Norway operations had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating $2,551 million with a fair value of $91 million to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk against the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency. Effective with the change in the functional currency, the Company terminated these hedges. The related net gain position of $109 million associated with the terminated hedges has been deferred and is being recognized into earnings in the future period(s) the forecasted transactions affect earnings, of which $10 million remains to be recognized into future earnings at December 31, 2009. The Company has subsequent to January 1, 2008, entered into new hedges to cover the exposures as a result of the changes to U.S. dollar functional. At December 31, 2009, our Norway operations had derivatives with $2,024 million in notional value with a fair value of $58 million, included in the table above. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2009 our long term borrowings consisted of $150 million in 6.5% Senior Notes, $200 million in 7.25% Senior Notes, $200 million in 5.65% Senior Notes, $150 million in 5.5% Senior Notes and $151 million in 6.125% Senior Notes. We occasionally have borrowings under our credit facility, and a portion of these borrowings could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market risk with exchange rate movements. These instruments carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from LIBOR, NIBOR or EURIBOR, or at the prime interest rate. Under our credit facility, we may, at our option, fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over LIBOR, NIBOR or EURIBOR for 30 days to 6 months. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with any of the numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies that govern environmental protection, zoning and other matters applicable to our businesses. Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies governing environmental protection, zoning and other matters. These laws and regulations have changed frequently in the past and it is reasonable to expect additional changes in the future. If existing regulatory requirements change, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures. We cannot assure you that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations. Governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Under these circumstances, we might be required to reduce or cease operations or conduct site remediation or other corrective action which could adversely impact our operations and financial condition. Our businesses expose us to potential environmental liability. Our businesses expose us to the risk that harmful substances may escape into the environment, which could result in: personal injury or loss of life; severe damage to or destruction of property; or environmental damage and suspension of operations. 21 Table of Contents Our current and past activities, as well as the activities of our former divisions and subsidiaries, could result in our facing substantial environmental, regulatory and other liabilities. These could include the costs of cleanup of contaminated sites and site closure obligations. These liabilities could also be imposed on the basis of one or more of the following theories: negligence; strict liability; breach of contract with customers; or as a result of our contractual agreement to indemnify our customers in the normal course of business, which is normally the case. We may not have adequate insurance for potential environmental liabilities. While we maintain liability insurance, this insurance is subject to coverage limits. In addition, certain policies do not provide coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination. We face the following risks with respect to our insurance coverage: we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms; we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance; our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies; or the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits. Even a partially uninsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could increase our operating costs or reduce demand for our products. Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. The adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases, including the imposition of fees or taxes, could adversely impact our operations and financial condition. The U.S. Congress is currently working on legislation to control and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States, which includes establishing cap and trade programs. In addition to the pending climate legislation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed regulations that would require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities, and may issue final rules this year. These changes in the legal and regulatory environment could reduce oil and natural gas drilling activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services, which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. The Company had revenues of 16.6% of total revenue from one of its customers for the year ended December 31, 2009. The loss of this customer or a significant reduction in its purchases could adversely affect our future revenues and earnings. 22 Table of Contents GLOSSARY OF OILFIELD TERMS (Sources: Company management; A Dictionary for the Petroleum Industry, The University of Texas at Austin, 2001.) API Abbr: American Petroleum Institute Annular Blowout Preventer A large valve, usually installed above the ram blowout preventers, that forms a seal in the annular space between the pipe and the wellbore or, if no pipe is present, in the wellbore itself. Annulus The open space around pipe in a wellbore through which fluids may pass. Automatic Pipe Handling Systems (Automatic Pipe Racker) A device used on a drilling rig to automatically remove and insert drill stem components from and into the hole. It replaces the need for a person to be in the derrick or mast when tripping pipe into or out of the hole. Automatic Roughneck A large, self contained pipe handling machine used by drilling crew members to make up and break out tubulars. The device combines a spinning wrench, torque wrench, and backup wrenches. Beam pump Surface pump that raise and lowers sucker rods continually, so as to operate a downhole pump. Bit The cutting or boring element used in drilling oil and gas wells. The bit consists of a cutting element and a circulating element. The cutting element is steel teeth, tungsten carbide buttons, industrial diamonds, or polycrystalline diamonds (PDCs). These teeth, buttons, or diamonds penetrate and gouge or scrape the formation to remove it. The circulating element permits the passage of drilling fluid and utilizes the hydraulic force of the fluid stream to improve drilling rates. In rotary drilling, several drill collars are joined to the bottom end of the drill pipe column, and the bit is attached to the end of the drill collars. Drill collars provide weight on the bit to keep it in firm contact with the bottom of the hole. Most bits used in rotary drilling are roller cone bits, but diamond bits are also used extensively. Blowout An uncontrolled flow of gas, oil or other well fluids into the atmosphere. A blowout, or gusher, occurs when formation pressure exceeds the pressure applied to it by the column of drilling fluid. A kick warns of an impending blowout. Blowout Preventer (BOP) Series of valves installed at the wellhead while drilling to prevent the escape of pressurized fluids. Blowout Preventer (BOP) Stack The assembly of well control equipment including preventers, spools, valves, and nipples connected to the top of the wellhead. Closed Loop Drilling Systems A solids control system in which the drilling mud is reconditioned and recycled through the drilling process on the rig itself. Coiled Tubing A continuous string of flexible steel tubing, often hundreds or thousands of feet long, that is wound onto a reel, often dozens of feet in diameter. The reel is an integral part of the coiled tubing unit, which consists of several devices that ensure the tubing can be safely and efficiently inserted into the well from the surface. Because tubing can be lowered into a well without having to make up joints of tubing, running coiled tubing into the well is faster and less expensive than running conventional tubing. Rapid advances in the use of coiled tubing make it a popular way in which to run tubing into and out of a well. Also called reeled tubing. Cuttings Fragments of rock dislodged by the bit and brought to the surface in the drilling mud. Washed and dried cutting samples are analyzed by geologist to obtain information about the formations drilled. Directional Well Well drilled in an orientation other than vertical in order to access broader portions of the formation. 23 Table of Contents Drawworks The hoisting mechanism on a drilling rig. It is essentially a large winch that spools off or takes in the drilling line and thus raises or lowers the drill stem and bit. Drill Pipe Elevator (Elevator) On conventional rotary rigs and top drive rigs, hinged steel devices with manual operating handles that crew members latch onto a tool joint (or a sub). Since the elevators are directly connected to the traveling block, or to the integrated traveling block in the top drive, when the driller raises or lowers the block or the top drive unit, the drill pipe is also raised or lowered. Drilling jars A percussion tool operated manually or hydraulically to deliver a heavy downward blow to free a stuck drill stem. Drilling mud A specially compounded liquid circulated through the wellbore during rotary drilling operations. Drilling riser A conduit used in offshore drilling through which the drill bit and other tools are passed from the rig on the waters surface to the sea floor. Drill stem All members in the assembly used for rotary drilling from the swivel to the bit, including the Kelly, the drill pipe and tool joints, the drill collars, the stabilizers, and various specialty items. Formation A bed or deposit composed throughout of substantially the same kind of rock; often a lithologic unit. Each formation is given a name, frequently as a result of the study of the formation outcrop at the surface and sometimes based on fossils found in the formation. FPSO A Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel used to receive hydrocarbons from subsea wells, and then produce and store the hydrocarbons until they can be offloaded to a tanker or pipeline. Hardbanding A special wear resistant material often applied to tool joints to prevent abrasive wear to the area when the pipe is being rotated downhole. Hydraulic Fracturing The process of creating fractures in a formation by pumping fluids, at high pressures, into the reservoir, which allows or enhances the flow of hydrocarbons. Iron Roughneck A floor mounted combination of a spinning wrench and a torque wrench. The Iron Roughneck moves into position hydraulically and eliminates the manual handling involved with suspended individual tools. Jack up rig A mobile bottom supported offshore drilling structure with columnar or open truss legs that support the deck and hull. When positioned over the drilling site, the bottoms of the legs penetrate the seafloor. Jar A mechanical device placed near the top of the drill stem which allows the driller to strike a very heavy blow upward or downward on stuck pipe. Joint 1. In drilling, a single length (from 16 feet to 45 feet, or 5 meters to 14.5 meters, depending on its range length) of drill pipe, drill collar, casing or tubing that has threaded connections at both ends. Several joints screwed together constitute a stand of pipe. 2. In pipelining, a single length (usually 40 feet 12 meters) of pipe. 3. In sucker rod pumping, a single length of sucker rod that has threaded connections at both ends. 24 Table of Contents Kelly The heavy steel tubular device, four or six sided, suspended from the swivel through the rotary table and connected to the top joint of drill pipe to turn the drill stem as the rotary table returns. It has a bored passageway that permits fluid to be circulated into the drill stem and up the annulus, or vice versa. Kellys manufactured to API specifications are available only in four or six sided versions, are either 40 or 54 feet (12 to 16 meters) long, and have diameters as small as 2.5 inches (6 centimeters) and as large as 6 inches (15 centimeters). Kelly bushing A special device placed around the kelly that mates with the kelly flats and fits into the master bushing of the rotary table. The kelly bushing is designed so that the kelly is free to move up or down through it. The bottom of the bushing may be shaped to fit the opening in the master bushing or it may have pins that fit into the master bushing. In either case, when the kelly bushing is inserted into the master bushing and the master bushing is turned, the kelly bushing also turns. Since the kelly bushing fits onto the kelly, the kelly turns, and since the kelly is made up to the drill stem, the drill stem turns. Also called the drive bushing. Kelly spinner A pneumatically operated device mounted on top of the kelly that, when actuated, causes the kelly to turn or spin. It is useful when the kelly or a joint of pipe attached to it must be spun up, that is, rotated rapidly for being made up. Kick An entry of water, gas, oil, or other formation fluid into the wellbore during drilling. It occurs because the pressure exerted by the column of drilling fluid is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the formation drilled. If prompt action is not taken to control the kick, or kill the well, a blowout may occur. Making up 1. To assemble and join parts to form a complete unit (e.g., to make up a string of drill pipe). 2. To screw together two threaded pieces. Compare break out. 3. To mix or prepare (e.g., to make up a tank of mud). 4. To compensate for (e.g., to make up for lost time). Manual tongs (Tongs) The large wrenches used for turning when making up or breaking out drill pipe, casing, tubing, or other pipe; variously called casing tongs, pipe tongs, and so forth, according to the specific use. Power tongs or power wrenches are pneumatically or hydraulically operated tools that serve to spin the pipe up tight and, in some instances to apply the final makeup torque. Master bushing A device that fits into the rotary table to accommodate the slips and drive the kelly bushing so that the rotating motion of the rotary table can be transmitted to the kelly. Also called rotary bushing. Motion compensation equipment Any device (such as a bumper sub or heave compensator) that serves to maintain constant weight on the bit in spite of vertical motion of a floating offshore drilling rig. Mud pump A large, high pressure reciprocating pump used to circulate the mud on a drilling rig. Plug gauging The mechanical process of ensuring that the inside threads on a piece of drill pipe comply with API standards. Pressure control equipment Equipment used in: 1. The act of preventing the entry of formation fluids into a wellbore. 2. The act of controlling high pressures encountered in a well. Pressure pumping Pumping fluids into a well by applying pressure at the surface. Ram blowout preventer A blowout preventer that uses rams to seal off pressure on a hole that is with or without pipe. Also called a ram preventer. Ring gauging The mechanical process of ensuring that the outside threads on a piece of drill pipe comply with API standards. Riser A pipe through which liquids travel upward. 25 Table of Contents Riser pipe The pipe and special fitting used on floating offshore drilling rigs to established a seal between the top of the wellbore, which is on the ocean floor, and the drilling equipment located above the surface of the water. A riser pipe serves as a guide for the drill stem from the drilling vessel to the wellhead and as a conductor or drilling fluid from the well to the vessel. The riser consists of several sections of pipe and includes special devices to compensate for any movement of the drilling rig caused by waves. Also called marine riser pipe, riser joint. Rotary table The principal piece of equipment in the rotary table assembly; a turning device used to impart rotational power to the drill stem while permitting vertical movement of the pipe for rotary drilling. The master bushing fits inside the opening of the rotary table; it turns the kelly bushing, which permits vertical movement of the kelly while the stem is turning. Rotating blowout preventer (Rotating Head) A sealing device used to close off the annular space around the kelly in drilling with pressure at the surface, usually installed above the main blowout preventers. A rotating head makes it possible to drill ahead even when there is pressure in the annulus that the weight of the drilling fluid is not overcoming; the head prevents the well from blowing out. It is used mainly in the drilling of formations that have low permeability. The rate of penetration through such formations is usually rapid. Safety clamps A clamp placed very tightly around a drill collar that is suspended in the rotary table by drill collar slips. Should the slips fail, the clamp is too large to go through the opening in the rotary table and therefore prevents the drill collar string from falling into the hole. Also called drill collar clamp. Shaker See Shale Shaker Shale shaker A piece of drilling rig equipment that uses a vibrating screen to remove cuttings from the circulating fluid in rotary drilling operations. The size of the openings in the screen should be selected carefully to be the smallest size possible to allow 100 per cent flow of the fluid. Also called a shaker. Slim hole completions (Slim hole Drilling) Drilling in which the size of the hole is smaller than the conventional hole diameter for a given depth. This decrease in hole size enables the operator to run smaller casing, thereby lessening the cost of completion. Slips Wedge shaped pieces of metal with serrated inserts (dies) or other gripping elements, such as serrated buttons, that suspend the drill pipe or drill collars in the master bushing of the rotary table when it is necessary to disconnect the drill stem from the kelly or from the top drive units drive shaft. Rotary slips fit around the drill pipe and wedge against the master bushing to support the pipe. Drill collar slips fit around a drill collar and wedge against the master bushing to support the drill collar. Power slips are pneumatically or hydraulically actuated devices that allow the crew to dispense with the manual handling of slips when making a connection. Solids See Cuttings Spinning wrench Air powered or hydraulically powered wrench used to spin drill pipe in making or breaking connections. Spinning in The rapid turning of the drill stem when one length of pipe is being joined to another. Spinning out refers to separating the pipe. Stand The connected joints of pipe racked in the derrick or mast when making a trip. On a rig, the usual stand is about 90 feet (about 27 meters) long (three lengths of drill pipe screwed together), or a treble. String The entire length of casing, tubing, sucker rods, or drill pipe run into a hole. 26 Table of Contents Sucker rod A special steel pumping rod. Several rods screwed together make up the link between the pumping unit on the surface and the pump at the bottom of the well. Tensioner A system of devices installed on a floating offshore drilling rig to maintain a constant tension on the riser pipe, despite any vertical motion made by the rig. The guidelines must also be tensioned, so a separate tensioner system is provided for them. Thermal desorption The process of removing drilling mud from cuttings by applying heat directly to drill cuttings. Tiebacks (Subsea) A series of flowlines and pipes that connect numerous subsea wellheads to a single collection point. Top drive A device similar to a power swivel that is used in place of the rotary table to turn the drill stem. It also includes power tongs. Modern top drives combine the elevator, the tongs, the swivel, and the hook. Even though the rotary table assembly is not used to rotate the drill stem and bit, the top drive system retains it to provide a place to set the slips to suspend the drill stem when drilling stops. Torque wrench Spinning wrench with a gauge for measuring the amount of torque being applied to the connection. Trouble cost Costs incurred as a result of unanticipated complications while drilling a well. These costs are often referred to as contingency costs during the planning phase of a well. Well completion 1. The activities and methods of preparing a well for the production of oil and gas or for other purposes, such as injection; the method by which one or more flow paths for hydrocarbons are established between the reservoir and the surface. 2. The system of tubulars, packers, and other tools installed beneath the wellhead in the production casing; that is, the tool assembly that provides the hydrocarbon flow path or paths. Wellhead The termination point of a wellbore at surface level or subsea, often incorporating various valves and control instruments. Well stimulation Any of several operations used to increase the production of a well, such as acidizing or fracturing. Well workover The performance of one or more of a variety of remedial operations on a producing oil well to try to increase production. Examples of workover jobs are deepening, plugging back, pulling and resetting liners, and squeeze cementing. Wellbore A borehole; the hole drilled by the bit. A wellbore may have casing in it or it may be open (uncased); or part of it may be cased, and part of it may be open. Also called a borehole or hole. Wireline A slender, rodlike or threadlike piece of metal usually small in diameter, that is used for lowering special tools (such as logging sondes, perforating guns, and so forth) into the well. Also called slick line. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General Overview The Company is a leading worldwide provider of highly engineered drilling and well servicing equipment, products and services to the exploration and production segments of the oil and gas industry. With operations in over 825 locations across six continents, we design, manufacture and service a comprehensive line of drilling and well servicing equipment; sell and rent drilling motors, specialized downhole tools, and rig instrumentation; perform inspection and internal coating of oilfield tubular products; provide drill cuttings separation, management and disposal systems and services; provide expendables and spare parts used in conjunction with our large installed base of equipment; and provide supply chain management services through our distribution network. We also manufacture coiled tubing, manufacture high pressure fiberglass and composite tubing, and sell and rent advanced in line inspection equipment to makers of oil country tubular goods. We have a long tradition of pioneering innovations which improve the cost effectiveness, efficiency, safety, and environmental impact of oil and gas operations. Our revenues and operating results are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling and production activities and the profitability and cash flow of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, which in turn are affected by current and anticipated prices of oil and gas. Oil and gas prices have been and are likely to continue to be volatile. See Risk Factors. We conduct our operations through three business segments: Rig Technology, Petroleum Services Supplies and Distribution Services. See Item 1. Business for a discussion of each of these business segments. Operating Environment Overview Our results are dependent on, among other things, the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling, well remediation activity, the price of crude oil and natural gas, capital spending by other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors, and the worldwide oil and gas inventory levels. Key industry indicators for the past three years include the following: % % 2009 v 2009 v 2009* 2008* 2007* 2008 2007 Active Drilling Rigs: U.S. 1,086 1,878 1,767 (42.2 %) (38.5 %) Canada 221 379 344 (41.7 %) (35.8 %) International 997 1,079 1,005 (7.6 %) (0.8 %) Worldwide 2,304 3,336 3,116 (30.9 %) (26.1 %) West Texas Intermediate Crude Prices (per barrel) $ 61.65 $ 99.63 $ 72.33 (38.1 %) (14.8 %) Natural Gas Prices ($/mmbtu) $ 3.95 $ 8.86 $ 6.97 (55.4 %) (43.3 %) * Averages for the years indicated. See sources below. 34 Table of Contents The following table details the U.S., Canadian, and international rig activity and West Texas Intermediate Oil prices for the past nine quarters ended December 31, 2009 on a quarterly basis: Source: Rig count: Baker Hughes, Inc. (www.bakerhughes.com); West Texas Intermediate Crude Price: Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (www.eia.doe.gov). The average price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate Crude was $61.65 per barrel in 2009, a decrease of 38.1% over the average price for 2008 of $99.63 per barrel. Average natural gas prices were $3.95 per mmbtu, a decrease of 55.4% compared to the 2008 average of $8.86 per mmbtu. Lower oil prices led to reduced rig activity worldwide, decreasing 30.9% for the full year in 2009 compared to 2008. Average crude oil prices for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $76.06 per barrel and natural gas was $4.34 per mmbtu. At February 5, 2010, there were 1,335 rigs actively drilling in the U.S., compared to 1,189 rigs at December 31, 2009; an increase of 12.3% from year end 2009 levels. The price of oil and gas had dropped to $71.15 per barrel and $5.52 per mmbtu, respectively, at February 5, 2010 representing 10.4% (oil) and 5.2% (gas) declines from the end of 2009. 35 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY National Oilwell Varco produced $1.5 billion in net income or $3.52 per fully diluted share in 2009. Revenues of $12.7 billion declined five percent from 2008 as stated, but declined nine percent when including full year 2008 pro forma sales for Grant Prideco, which the Company acquired in April 2008. Operating profit was $2.3 billion in 2009, compared to $2.9 billion in 2008. Generally 2009 was a more challenging year than 2008, as a worldwide recession led to lower demand for oil and gas and lower commodity prices, which led in turn to lower oil and gas drilling activity. This development negatively affected many of our businesses, but was partly offset by results from our Rig Technology segment which carried a high level of contracted work into the year, and produced higher year over year revenues. Profitability was adversely affected by intangible asset impairment, transaction, voluntary early retirement and other restructuring charges in 2009 that totaled $234 million pre tax or $0.37 per dilutive share after tax. Excluding these items earnings would have been $3.89 per diluted share. For its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, National Oilwell Varco generated earnings of $394 million or $0.94 per fully diluted share, on revenues of $3.1 billion. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 revenue declined 18 percent and net income attributable to the Company declined 33 percent. Compared to the third quarter of 2009 revenue increased two percent and net income attributable to the Company increased two percent. Fourth quarter 2009 operating profit was $622 million or 19.8 percent of sales, compared to $618 million or 20.0 percent of sales in the third quarter of 2009, and $877 million or 23.0 percent of sales in the fourth quarter of 2008, excluding transaction and restructuring charges from all periods. Year over year quarterly declines across all segments were a result of lower activity and pricing in most oilfield markets. The modest sequential improvement in the fourth quarter of 2009 was driven by higher sequential activity in North American markets driving better results from the Companys Petroleum Services Supplies and Distribution Services segments, offset by slightly lower results from Rig Technology. Oil Gas Equipment and Services Market Worldwide developed economies turned down sharply late in 2008 as looming housing related asset write downs at major financial institutions paralyzed credit markets and sparked a serious global banking crisis. Major central banks have responded vigorously, but credit and financial markets have not yet fully recovered, and a credit driven worldwide economic recession deepened during the second quarter. Asset and commodity prices, including oil and gas prices, have declined sharply. After rising steadily for six years to peak at around $147 per barrel earlier in 2008, oil prices collapsed back to average $42.91 per barrel during the first quarter of 2009, but have been recovering steadily to average $76.06 per barrel during the fourth quarter of 2009. Higher oil and gas prices over the past several years led to high levels of exploration and development drilling in many oil and gas basins around the globe by 2008, but activity slowed sharply in 2009 with lower oil and gas prices and tightening credit availability. The count of rigs actively drilling in the U.S. as measured by Baker Hughes (a good measure of the level of oilfield activity and spending) peaked at 2,031 rigs in September 2008, but decreased to a low of 876 in June 2009. Rig count has increased to 1,335 in February 2010, and averaged 1,108 rigs during the fourth quarter of 2009. Many oil and gas operators reliant on external financing to fund their drilling programs significantly curtailed their drilling activity earlier in the year, but drilling appears to be recovering across North America as gas prices firmed above $4.00 per mmbtu (the fourth quarter average was $4.34 per mmbtu). Most international activity is driven by oil exploration and production by national oil companies, which has historically been less susceptible to short term commodity price swings, but the international rig count has exhibited modest declines nonetheless, falling from its September 2008 peak of 1,108 to 986 in September 2009, but recently climbing back to 1,047 in January 2010. During the year the Company saw its Petroleum Services Supplies and its Distribution Services margins affected most acutely by a drilling downturn, through both volume and price declines; nevertheless, both of these segments saw prices stabilize and revenues recover modestly from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. The Companys Rig Technology segment was less impacted through the year owing to its high level of contracted backlog and strong execution during the year. Recent downturns followed an extended period of high drilling activity which fueled strong demand for oilfield services between 2003 and 2008. Incremental drilling activity through the upswing shifted toward harsh environments, employing increasingly sophisticated technology to find and produce reserves. Higher utilization of drilling rigs tested the capability of the worlds fleet of rigs, much of which is old and of limited capability. Technology has advanced significantly since most of the existing rig fleet was built. The industry invested little during the late 1980s and 1990s on new drilling equipment, but drilling technology progressed steadily nonetheless, as the Company and its competitors continued to invest in new and better ways of drilling. As a consequence, the safety, reliability, and efficiency of new, modern rigs surpass the performance of most of the older rigs at work today. Drilling rigs are now being pushed to drill deeper wells, more complex wells, highly deviated wells and horizontal wells, tasks which require larger rigs with more capabilities. The drilling process effectively consumes the mechanical components of a rig, which wear out and need periodic repair or replacement. This process was accelerated by very high rig utilization and wellbore complexity. Drilling consumes rigs; more complex and challenging drilling consumes rigs faster. 36 Table of Contents The industry responded by launching many new rig construction projects since 2005 to: 1.) retool the existing fleet of jackup rigs (according to Offshore Data Services, 72 percent of the existing 457 jackup rigs are more than 25 years old); 2.) replace older mechanical and DC electric land rigs with improved AC power, electronic controls, automatic pipe handling and rapid rigup and rigdown technology; and 3.) build out additional deepwater floating drilling rigs, including semisubmersibles and drillships, to employ recent advancements in deepwater drilling to exploit unexplored deepwater basins. We believe that the newer rigs offer considerably higher efficiency, safety, and capability, and that many will effectively replace a portion of the existing fleet, and that declining dayrates may accelerate the retirement of older rigs. As a result of these trends the Companys Rig Technology segment grew its backlog of capital equipment orders from $0.9 billion at March 31, 2005, to $11.8 billion at September 30, 2008. However, as a result of the credit crisis and slowing drilling activity, orders have declined below amounts flowing out of backlog as revenue, causing the backlog to decline to $6.4 billion at December 31, 2009. The land rig backlog comprised 11 percent, and equipment destined for offshore operations comprised 89 percent of the total backlog as of December 31, 2009. Equipment destined for international markets totaled 92 percent of the backlog. The Company believes that its existing contracts for rig equipment are very strong in that they carry significant down payment and progress billing terms favorable to the ultimate completion of these projects, and generally do not allow customers to cancel projects for convenience. During 2009 the Company removed $259 million in discontinued orders on cancelled projects and project change orders requested by customers. We do not expect the credit crisis or softer market to result in additional material cancellation of contracts or abandonment of major projects; however, there can be no assurance that such discontinuance of projects will not occur. The Company had approximately $274 million of projects in its December 31, 2009 backlog that it considers at risk. Segment Performance Rig Technology generated a record $8.1 billion in revenue and $2.3 billion in operating profit in 2009, producing operating margins for the segment of 28.2 percent, excluding transaction and restructuring charges. The segment generated 55 percent operating profit leverage or flow through (the change in operating profit divided by the change in revenue period to period) on eight percent higher sales as compared to 2008, excluding charges. Revenue out of backlog of $6.2 billion increased 18 percent from the prior year. Execution of the backlog orders was very strong, which led to higher margin performance for the Rig Technology segment in the third quarter due to excellent cost control, deflation in certain inputs, greater experience building and commissioning rigs which enables better efficiencies, and somewhat better foreign currency exchange movements. As a result our estimated costs to complete projects declined steadily through 2009. As of December 31, 2009 the scheduled outflow of revenue from backlog is expected to be approximately $4.6 billion in 2010, and $1.5 billion for 2011, and $0.3 billion in 2012. From 2005 through the current quarter, the segment has delivered over 70 newly built offshore rigs. Aftermarket spare parts and services revenue was $1.4 billion in 2009 or 17 percent of total segment sales. The balance of Rig Technology revenues were smaller capital items which the Company does not book into its backlog. These items were adversely affected by lower purchases by many land contractors in view of markedly softer drilling demand during the year. Demand for offshore rigs and equipment is strongest in Brazil, owing to significant drilling equipment needs to develop new ultradeepwater discoveries, and the segment also continues to pursue a variety of new offshore rig, intervention vessel, FPSO and platform upgrade opportunities in other markets. However, tight credit markets and fewer committed term contracts for rigs by oil and gas companies as compared to market conditions in 2006 2008 are adversely affecting new orders. Demand for land rig and well stimulation equipment has also been very slow, except for the Middle East and certain Latin American markets, but resumed late in the year in the U.S. Additionally, demand for coiled tubing units and pressure pumping equipment for both North America and international markets also recovered late in the year. The Petroleum Services Supplies segment generated revenues of $3.7 billion and operating profit of $0.5 billion or 12.1 percent of sales in 2009, excluding impairment, transaction and restructuring charges. Revenues declined 29 percent from 2008, when including pro forma revenue for Grant Prideco, and decremental operating leverage or flow through was 55 percent from 2008, excluding charges, due to a high level of price discounting on most products and services through the year. Prices appeared to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2009, settling roughly 25 percent below peak pricing levels of 2008 (although some products and services are at greater, and some at lesser, levels of discounting). Sharply rising North American rig counts led to modestly tightening supplies of many of the segments products, which contributed to the stabilization. As working rigs were stacked during 2009 their owners tended to cannibalize consumables and smaller capital items from these rather than purchase goods from the Company. During the fourth quarter some of these rigs were restocked with new goods, which led to new orders for the Company and benefitted its fourth quarter results in North America. International demand remained somewhat stable, and did not turn down as sharply earlier in the year as gas driven North American drilling. Drill pipe sales remain challenged due to the large amount of idle drill pipe inventory remaining with drilling contractors. Nevertheless, drill pipe margins have remained good due to lower costs and a positive mix shift toward premium drill pipe, for new offshore rigs being delivered, and for complex horizontal and extended reach drilling programs onshore. We do not expect drill pipe demand to recover significantly until inventories are depleted through consumption, late in 2010 at the earliest. In total the Petroleum Services Supplies segment generated approximately 47 percent of its sales into North American markets, and 53 percent of its sales into international markets, during 2009. 37 Table of Contents The Distribution Services segment generated total sales of $1.4 billion in 2009, down 24 percent from 2008 sales. Operating profit excluding transaction and restructuring charges was $50 million or 3.7 percent of sales. Decremental operating leverage or flow through was 19 percent on the $422 million sales decline from the prior year, higher than the segments historical average, due largely to price discounting in North America, which comprised 70 percent of the segments revenue in 2009. The segments lower results were driven by a much lower level of drilling activity, which led to intense price pressure and lower volumes for the group. International results were generally much more stable in 2009 as compared to 2008, as higher sales of artificial lift products into Latin America helped offset declines elsewhere. The segment posted 8 percent higher quarterly sequential results in the fourth quarter of 2009 as the North American rig count moved up sharply and customers ordered MRO supplies for rigs going back to work. Specifically new unconventional shale gas fields in the Marcellus, Haynesville, Bakken and other areas led most of the recovery. Outlook The credit market downturn, global recession, and lower commodity prices presented significant challenges to our business in 2009. Consequently we remain cautious in our outlook for 2010, but we believe we are seeing signs of stabilization in many of our markets, and are encouraged by limited demand growth in North America seen late in the year. Order levels for new drilling rigs declined significantly in 2009 as compared to 2008, but we continue to bid a number of large projects, including up to 28 new offshore floating rigs to be built in Brazil. We are hopeful that these will translate into more orders during the coming year, assuming, among other things, that rig dayrates generally hold up well; that commodity prices remain high; and that broad economic conditions do not deteriorate further. North American land gas drilling activity, particularly by independent gas producers reliant on external financing, fell sharply early in 2009, but we believe better commodity prices are leading to recovery as we enter 2010. Our outlook for international markets, which are more driven by national oil company activity and are historically less volatile, remains good owing to high and stable oil price levels established through the second half of 2009. Our outlook for the Companys Petroleum Services Supplies segment and Distribution Services segment remains closely tied to the rig count, particularly in North America. If the rig count continues to increase we expect these segments to benefit from higher demand for the services, consumables and capital items they supply. The Rig Technology segment was less affected by the downturn during 2009 due to the strength of its backlog, but as the backlog has declined we expect to see revenues and margins decline through 2010 as well. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced a currency devaluation which included a two tier exchange rate system. The Company has net assets employed in Venezuela of approximately $80 million, and generated revenue and operating profit of approximately $75 million and $10 million, respectively, in 2009. We expect to incur a pre tax charge between $20 million and $30 million in the first quarter of 2010 related to the impact of the currency devaluation and changes to social regulations impacting our operations in Venezuela. The Company believes it is well positioned to continue to manage through this downturn, and should benefit from its strong balance sheet and capitalization, access to credit, and a high level of contracted orders which are expected to continue to generate earnings in the coming year. The Company has a long history of cost control and downsizing in response to depressed market conditions, and of executing strategic acquisitions during difficult periods. Such a period may present opportunities to the Company to effect new organic growth and acquisition initiatives, and we remain hopeful that a downturn will generate new opportunities. 38 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 The following table summarizes the Companys revenue and operating profit by operating segment in 2009 and 2008. The actual results include results from Grant Prideco operations from the acquisition date of April 21, 2008 (in millions): Years Ended December 31, Variance 2009 2008 $ % Revenue: Rig Technology $ 8,093 $ 7,528 $ 565 7.5 % Petroleum Services Supplies 3,745 4,651 (906 ) (19.5 %) Distribution Services 1,350 1,772 (422 ) (23.8 %) Eliminations (476 ) (520 ) 44 (8.5 %) Total Revenue $ 12,712 $ 13,431 $ (719 ) (5.4 %) Operating Profit: Rig Technology $ 2,283 $ 1,970 $ 313 15.9 % Petroleum Services Supplies 301 1,044 (743 ) (71.2 %) Distribution Services 50 130 (80 ) (61.5 %) Unallocated expenses and eliminations (319 ) (226 ) (93 ) 41.2 % Total Operating Profit $ 2,315 $ 2,918 $ (603 ) (20.7 %) Operating Profit %: Rig Technology 28.2 % 26.2 % Petroleum Services Supplies 8.0 % 22.4 % Distribution Services 3.7 % 7.3 % Total Operating Profit % 18.2 % 21.7 % Rig Technology Rig Technology revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $8,093 million, an increase of $565 million (7.5%) compared to 2008. Revenue out of backlog increased $934 million or 18% from 2008 due to an increase in the number of large rig projects delivered this year. Non backlog revenue decreased $369 million or 17% compared to 2008, largely due to lower spare parts and capital equipment sales as North American land drillers and pressure pumpers decreased their capital spending in 2009. Operating profit from Rig Technology was $2,283 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $313 million (15.9%) over the same period of 2008. Operating profit percentage increased to 28.2%, up from 26.2% in 2008 primarily due to the increased manufacturing efficiencies and revision of cost estimates on large rig projects as a result of favorable pricing from vendors. The Rig Technology group monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when we receive a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $6.4 billion at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $4.7 billion (42.3%) from backlog of $11.1 billion at December 31, 2008. Approximately $4.6 billion of the current backlog is expected to be delivered in 2010. Petroleum Services Supplies Revenue from Petroleum Services Supplies was $3,745 million for 2009 compared to $4,651 million for 2008, a decrease of $906 million (19.5%). The decrease was primarily attributable to a 42% decline in North American average rig count activity in 2009 compared to 2008. Operating profit from Petroleum Services Supplies was $301 million for 2009 compared to $1,044 million for 2008, a decrease of $743 million (71.2%). Operating profit percentage decreased to 8.0% down from 22.4% in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to reduced North American rig count activity combined with strong price competition. In addition, a $147 million impairment charge was incurred on the carrying value of a trade name associated with this segment in the second quarter of 2009. 39 Table of Contents Distribution Services Revenue from Distribution Services totaled $1,350 million for 2009, a decrease of $422 million (23.8%) from 2008. The decrease in revenue is mainly concentrated in the North American region as average drilling activity declined 42% in 2009 compared to the prior year. Operating profit decreased in 2009 to $50 million compared to $130 million in 2008. Operating profit percentage decreased to 3.7% in 2009 from 7.3% in 2008 as a result of strong price competition and volume declines as North American rig activity declined. Unallocated expenses and eliminations Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $319 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $226 million for 2008. The increase in unallocated expenses and eliminations was primarily due to the voluntary retirement costs of $46 million. Acquisition costs also contributed to the increase from 2008. Interest and financial costs Interest and financial costs were $53 million for 2009 compared to $67 million for 2008. The decrease in interest and financial costs were primarily a direct result of the repayment of borrowings on the Companys credit facility used to purchase Grant Prideco, the repayment of the Companys 7.5% Senior Notes and the repayment of a portion of the Companys 6.125% Senior Notes. These repayments occurred during 2008 causing lower debt levels in 2009. Equity Income in Unconsolidated Affiliate Equity income in unconsolidated affiliate was $47 million for 2009 compared to $42 million for 2008 and was related to the April 21, 2008 acquisition of Grant Prideco. The income was related to the equity earnings from the Companys 50.01% investment in Voest Alpine Tubulars (VAT) located in Kindberg, Austria. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net was expense, net of $110 million in 2009 compared to income, net of $23 million in 2008. The 2009 expense was primarily due to a net foreign exchange loss of $79 million, as compared to a net foreign exchange gain of $50 million in 2008. The 2009 foreign exchange losses were primarily due to adjustments of our hedge positions as a result of the current economic environment and the strengthening of the Euro, the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone compared to the U.S. dollar. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Rates. Provision for income taxes The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 33.3% compared to 33.5% for 2008. The tax rate includes $21 million of additional tax provision recognized in the second quarter 2009 on prior year income in Norway. These additional taxes resulted from foreign currency gains on dollar denominated accounts that were realized for Norwegian tax purposes. The Company expects its income tax rate to be in the 30% to 32% range in 2010. 40 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 The following table summarizes the Companys revenue and operating profit by operating segment in 2008 and 2007. The actual results include results from Grant Prideco operations from the acquisition date of April 21, 2008 (in millions): Years Ended December 31, Variance 2008 2007 $ % Revenue: Rig Technology $ 7,528 $ 5,745 $ 1,783 31.0 % Petroleum Services Supplies 4,651 3,061 1,590 51.9 % Distribution Services 1,772 1,424 348 24.4 % Eliminations (520 ) (441 ) (79 ) 17.9 % Total Revenue $ 13,431 $ 9,789 $ 3,642 37.2 % Operating Profit: Rig Technology $ 1,970 $ 1,394 $ 576 41.3 % Petroleum Services Supplies 1,044 732 312 42.6 % Distribution Services 130 94 36 38.3 % Unallocated expenses and eliminations (226 ) (176 ) (50 ) 28.4 % Total Operating Profit $ 2,918 $ 2,044 $ 874 42.8 % Operating Profit %: Rig Technology 26.2 % 24.3 % Petroleum Services Supplies 22.4 % 23.9 % Distribution Services 7.3 % 6.6 % Total Operating Profit % 21.7 % 20.9 % Rig Technology Rig Technology revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $7,528 million, an increase of $1,783 million (31.0%) compared to 2007. Revenue out of backlog increased $1,217 million or 29.8% from 2007 due to the growing market for capital equipment, as evidenced by backlog growth during the first three quarters of 2008. The increase in orders and backlog resulted from continued capital investments by drilling contractors in 2008, primarily related to the international offshore market. Non backlog revenue increased $567 million or 34.1% over 2007, largely due to increased spare parts sales and service revenues related to the increased drilling activity during the year. Operating profit from Rig Technology was $1,970 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $576 million (41.3%) over the same period of 2007. The increase in operating profit was largely due to the increased activity discussed above as well as improved pricing on large rig contracts and aftermarket products. The Rig Technology group monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when we receive a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $11.1 billion at December 31, 2008, an increase of $2.1 billion (23.3%) over backlog of $9.0 billion at December 31, 2007. Petroleum Services Supplies Revenue from Petroleum Services Supplies was $4,651 million for 2008 compared to $3,061 million for 2007, an increase of $1,590 million (51.9%). The increase was mostly attributable to the acquisition of Grant Prideco which contributed sales of $1,435 million since the acquisition date of April 21, 2008. Higher demand for most of the products and services offered by the segment also contributed to the higher revenue compared to 2007. Rig count in North America and international markets during 2008 were up 6.9% and 7.3%, respectively, compared to 2007 averages, prompting higher demand from our services group. Operating profit from Petroleum Services Supplies was $1,044 million for 2008 compared to $732 million for 2007, an increase of $312 million (42.6%). Grant Prideco contributed $297 million of operating profit since April 21, 2008. Included in the Grant Prideco operating profit was $89 million of expense recorded in cost of revenue that resulted from the fair value step up of inventory as part of the purchase accounting valuation of Grant Prideco. The increase was also attributable to higher profitability across most product lines. 41 Table of Contents Distribution Services Revenue from Distribution Services totaled $1,772 million in 2008, an increase of $348 million (24.4%) from the prior period. The number of drilling rigs actively searching for oil and gas is a key metric for this business segment. Worldwide rig count increased 7.1% in 2008 compared to 2007, with increases of 10.3%, 7.3% and 6.3% in Canada, international and the U.S. rig activity, respectively. The Companys Distribution Services segment continued efforts to expand in international markets resulted in a 25% increase in international revenue. The expansion primarily consisted of opening rig stores or facilities that maintain levels of consumables used on rigs, in centrally located areas. In addition, the Company has begun to open stores on individual rigs. After opening its first rig store in 2007, the Company opened eight additional stores during 2008 continuing the efforts to expand its presence both in the U.S. and internationally. Operating income increased in 2008 to $130 million compared to $94 million in 2007. Margins increased slightly to 7.3% of revenue in 2008 compared to 6.6% of revenue in 2007. The increase in margin was primarily due to the cost reduction actions taken in Canada to offset the weakening demand seen in the later part of 2007 combined with the increase in profit margins from international locations. Unallocated expenses and eliminations Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $226 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $176 million for 2007. The increase in unallocated expenses and eliminations was primarily due to greater inter segment profit eliminations and greater stock based compensation expense. The stock based compensation expense was $61 million and $43 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2008 results also included $11 million of integration costs related to the 2008 acquisition of Grant Prideco. Interest and financial costs Interest and financial costs were $67 million for 2008 compared to $50 million for 2007. The increase was primarily due to the borrowings related to the merger with Grant Prideco. Equity Income in Unconsolidated Affiliate Equity income in unconsolidated affiliate was $42 million for 2008 and was related to the April 21, 2008 acquisition of Grant Prideco. The income was related to the equity earnings from the Companys 50.01% investment in Voest Alpine Tubulars (VAT) located in Kindberg, Austria. The Companys investment in VAT is accounted for under the equity method of accounting due to the minority owner having substantive participating rights. Step up depreciation and amortization of $8 million was recorded in 2008 related to VAT and charges of $11 million were recorded related to inventory step up. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net was an income, net of $23 million and an expense of $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. The 2008 income was primarily due to a net foreign exchange gain which was $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The 2008 foreign exchange gains were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone compared to the U.S. dollar. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Rates. Provision for income taxes The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.5% compared to 33.3% for 2007. The 2008 rate reflects increasing benefits in the U.S. from the tax incentive for manufacturing activities and a higher percentage of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. This was partially offset by additional tax provisions related to the Companys decision to repatriate earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries during the year and net higher tax expense in Norway related to movement in exchange rates after the change of the functional currency to the U.S. dollar. The net additional tax expense in Norway included a $46 million charge resulting from realized foreign exchange gains on U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities. This was partially offset by a $30 million benefit for the same period, which was reported as provision for income tax, from the remeasurement into U.S. dollars of foreign currency denominated deferred tax assets and liabilities in the balance sheet. 42 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2009, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2,622 million, and total debt of $883 million. At December 31, 2008, cash and cash equivalents were $1,543 million and total debt was $874 million. A portion of the consolidated cash balances are maintained in accounts in various foreign subsidiaries and, if such amounts were transferred among countries or repatriated to the U.S., such amounts may be subject to additional tax obligations. The Companys outstanding debt at December 31, 2009 consisted of $200 million of 5.65% Senior Notes due 2012, $200 million of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2011, $150 million of 6.5% Senior Notes due 2011, $150 million of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2012, $151 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2015, and other debt of $32 million. The Company had $2,073 million of additional outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2009, primarily in Norway, that are essentially under various bilateral committed letter of credit facilities. Other letters of credit are issued as bid bonds and performance bonds. The Senior Notes contain reporting covenants and the credit facility contains a financial covenant regarding maximum debt to capitalization. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2009. There were no borrowings against the Companys unsecured credit facility, and there were $588 million in outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility, resulting in $1,412 million of funds available under the Companys unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2009. The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the periods presented (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,095 $ 2,294 $ 1,188 Net cash used in investing activities (552 ) (2,473 ) (575 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (491 ) (74 ) 150 Operating Activities Net cash flow provided by operating activities in 2009 decreased $199 million to $2,095 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $2,294 million in the same period of 2008. Before changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, cash was provided by operations primarily through net income of $1,473 million plus non cash charges of $704 million and dividends from unconsolidated affiliates of $86 million less $47 million in equity income from the Companys unconsolidated affiliate. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, used cash of $22 million during 2009, compared to $147 million used during 2008. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in 2009 was $552 million compared to net cash used in investing of $2,473 million for the same period of 2008. The primary reason for the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2009 related to a decrease in size of business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, to approximately $573 million compared to $3,008 million used in 2008 which included the purchase of the business and operating assets of Grant Prideco. Sale of equity interest provided $251 million of cash in 2009 compared to business divestitures of $801 million received in 2008 related to the disposition of certain Grant Prideco tubular businesses. In addition, the Company used $250 million for capital expenditures in 2009, compared to $379 million in 2008, received $19 million less in dividends from its unconsolidated affiliate compared to 2008, and included $86 million of the dividends from unconsolidated affiliate received in 2009 in operating activities. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities in 2009 was $491 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $74 million for the same period of 2008. The cash used in financing activities in 2009 primarily related to $460 million in cash dividends paid during the last month of 2009. In addition, cash used in financing activities in 2009 related to $47 million cash payments on debt primarily acquired in 2009 acquisitions, offset by cash proceeds from borrowings in the amount of $7 million as well as exercised stock options and excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options in the amount of $9 million. The borrowings and payments of debt in 2008 primarily relates to the financing of the Grant Prideco acquisition. For 2009, the Company used its cash on hand to fund its acquisitions. 43 Table of Contents The effect of the change in exchange rates on cash flows was a positive $27 million and a negative $46 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. We believe cash on hand, cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund operations, working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and financing obligations. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $1,412 million of available funds under its revolving credit facility. We also believe increases in capital expenditures caused by any need to increase manufacturing capacity can be funded from operations or through existing available debt financing. A summary of the Companys outstanding contractual obligations at December 31, 2009 is as follows (in millions): Payment Due by Period Less than After Total 1Year 1 3Years 4 5Years 5Years Contractual Obligations: Total debt $ 883 $ 7 $ 717 $ 6 $ 153 Operating leases 553 122 156 96 179 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,436 $ 129 $ 873 $ 102 $ 332 Commercial Commitments: Standby letters of credit $ 2,661 $ 1,762 $ 721 $ 176 $ 2 As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $58 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. We intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates, but the timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted. We expect to fund future cash acquisitions and capital spending primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings, including the unborrowed portion of the credit facility or new debt issuances, but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions. There can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us. Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing the financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition under long term construction contracts; allowance for doubtful accounts; inventory reserves; impairments of long lived assets (excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets); goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable. The combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material. Revenue Recognition under Long term Construction Contracts The Company uses the percentage of completion method to account for certain long term construction contracts in the Rig Technology group. These long term construction contracts include the following characteristics: the contracts include custom designs for customer specific applications; the structural design is unique and requires significant engineering efforts; and construction projects often have progress payments. 44 Table of Contents This method requires the Company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project, progress against the project schedule and the estimated completion date, all of which impact the amount of revenue and gross margin the Company recognizes in each reporting period. The Company prepares detailed cost to complete estimates at the beginning of each project, taking into account all factors considered likely to affect gross margin. Significant projects and their related costs and profit margins are updated and reviewed at least quarterly by senior management. Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include shipyard access, weather, production efficiencies, availability and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents and other factors as mentioned in Risk Factors. These factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the Companys estimates and materially impact the Companys future reported earnings. Historically, the Companys estimates have been reasonably dependable regarding the recognition of revenues and gross profits on percentage of completion contracts. Based upon an analysis of percentage of completion contracts for all open contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007, adjustments (representing the differences between the estimated and actual results) to all outstanding contracts resulted in net changes to gross profit margins of 1% ($53 million on $5.4 billion of outstanding contracts) and 0.8% ($31 million on $3.8 billion of outstanding contracts), respectively. While the Company believes that its estimates on outstanding contracts at December 31, 2009 and in future periods will continue to be reasonably dependable under percentage of completion accounting, the factors identified in the preceding paragraph could result in significant adjustments in future periods. The Company has recorded revenue on outstanding contracts (on a contract to date basis) of $8.6 billion at December 31, 2009. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The determination of the collectability of amounts due from customer accounts requires the Company to make judgments regarding future events and trends. Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on a continuous process of assessing the Companys portfolio on an individual customer basis taking into account current market conditions and trends. This process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, and financial condition of the Companys customers. Based on a review of these factors, the Company will establish or adjust allowances for specific customers. A substantial portion of the Companys revenues come from international oil companies, international shipyards, international oilfield service companies, and government owned or government controlled oil companies. Therefore, the Company has significant receivables in many foreign jurisdictions. If worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions deteriorate, the creditworthiness of the Companys customers could also deteriorate and they may be unable to pay these receivables, and additional allowances could be required. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, allowance for bad debts totaled $95 million and $73 million, or 4.3% and 2.3% of gross accounts receivable, respectively. Historically, the Companys charge offs and provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts have been immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. However, because of the risk factors mentioned above, changes in our estimates could become material in future periods. Inventory Reserves Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The Company determines reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on hand, assumptions about future demand and market conditions, and estimates about potential alternative uses, which are usually limited. The Companys inventory consists of specialized spare parts, work in process, and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the Companys large installed base of specialized equipment used throughout the oilfield. Customers rely on the Company to stock these specialized items to ensure that their equipment can be repaired and serviced in a timely manner. The Companys estimated carrying value of inventory therefore depends upon demand driven by oil and gas drilling and well remediation activity, which depends in turn upon oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, available financing for the Companys customers, political stability in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, inventory reserves totaled $206 million and $123 million, or 5.9% and 3.1% of gross inventory, respectively. While inventory reserves and accruals have not had a material impact on the Companys financial results for the periods covered in this report, changes in worldwide oil and gas activity, or the development of new technologies which make older drilling technologies obsolete, could require the Company to record additional allowances to reduce the value of its inventory. Such changes in our estimates could be material under weaker market conditions or outlook. 45 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived Assets (Excluding Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets) Long lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and identified intangible assets, comprise a significant amount of the Companys total assets. The Company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation and amortization methods and estimated useful lives. The carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable. We estimate the fair value of these intangible and fixed assets using an income approach. This requires the Company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. These forecasts require assumptions about demand for the Companys products and services, future market conditions and technological developments. The forecasts are dependent upon assumptions regarding oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, available financing for the Companys customers, political stability in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our income forecast as well as our weighted average cost of capital, both key assumptions used in our calculation. Changes to these assumptions, including, but not limited to: further sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts, further collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas, significant additional deterioration of external financing for our customers, higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity, or any other significant adverse economic news could require a provision for impairment in a future period. Due to further significant declines in the Companys stock price and oil and gas commodity prices, coupled with unprecedented turbulence in the credit markets, the Company determined a triggering event occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. The Company performed an impairment analysis at December 31, 2008 which did not result in an impairment charge. Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets The Company has approximately $5.5 billion of goodwill and $0.6 billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of December 31, 2009. Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include, but not limited to: further sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts, further collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas, significant additional deterioration of external financing for our customers, higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity. The annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each year. Based on its analysis, the Company did not report any impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. As described below, the Company concluded that an indicator of impairment occurred in the second quarter of 2009 and updated its impairment testing at June 30, 2009. Based on its updated analysis, the Company concluded that it did not incur an impairment of goodwill for the period ended June 30, 2009. However, based on the Companys indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of 2009, the Company concluded that it incurred an impairment charge to certain indefinite lived intangible assets of $147 million at June 30, 2009. The $147 million impairment charge is included in the Companys consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, the worldwide average rig count was 2,009 rigs, down 41% from the fourth quarter 2008 average of 3,395 and down 25% from the first quarter 2009 average of 2,681. The second quarter 2009 average rig count represented the lowest quarterly average in the past six years. In addition, the Companys updated forecast was behind the Companys previous forecast completed at the beginning of 2009. While operating profit for the first quarter of 2009 was in line with the Companys first quarter 2009 operating profit forecast, the Companys consolidated operating profit for the second quarter of 2009 was below its second quarter 2009 forecast. As a result of the substantial decline in the worldwide rig count, and the decline in actual/forecasted results compared to the original 2009 forecast, the Company concluded that events or circumstances had occurred indicating that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired as described under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other. Therefore, the Company performed its interim impairment test of goodwill for all its reporting units at the end of the second quarter of 2009. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of that reporting unit as a whole. Fair value of the reporting units is determined in accordance with ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures using significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. These inputs are based on internal management estimates, forecasts and judgments, using a combination of three methods: discounted cash flow, comparable companies, and representative transactions. While the Company primarily uses the discounted cash flow method to assess fair value, the Company uses the comparable companies and representative transaction methods to validate the discounted cash flow analysis and further support managements expectations, where possible. 46 Table of Contents The discounted cash flow is based on managements short term and long term forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit. The two main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment, which bear the risk of change and could impact the Companys goodwill impairment analysis, include the cash flow from operations from each of the Companys individual business units and the weighted average cost of capital. The starting point for each of the reporting units cash flow from operations is the detailed annual plan or updated forecast. The detailed planning and forecasting process takes into consideration a multitude of factors including worldwide rig activity, inflationary forces, pricing strategies, customer analysis, operational issues, competitor analysis, capital spending requirements, working capital needs, customer needs to replace aging equipment, increased complexity of drilling, new technology, and existing backlog among other items which impact the individual reporting unit projections. Cash flows beyond the specific operating plans were estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporated historical and forecasted financial cyclical trends for each reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit changes are a short term or long term trend. Projections for the remainder of 2009 also reflected declines compared to the original 2009 annual forecast. The Company updated its 2009 operating forecast, long term forecast, and discounted cash flows based on this information. The goodwill impairment analysis that we performed during the second quarter of 2009 did not result in goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2009. Other indefinite lived intangible assets, representing trade names management intends to use indefinitely, were valued using significant unobservable inputs (level 3) and are tested for impairment using the Relief from Royalty Method, a form of the Income Approach. An impairment is measured and recognized based on the amount the book value of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds its estimated fair value as of the date of the impairment test. Included in the impairment test are assumptions, for each trade name, regarding the related revenue streams attributable to the trade names which are determined consistent with the forecasting process described above, the royalty rate, and the discount rate applied. Based on the Companys indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of 2009, the Company incurred an impairment charge of $147 million in the Petroleum Services Supplies segment related to a partial impairment of the Companys Grant Prideco trade name. The impairment charge was primarily the result of the substantial decline in worldwide rig counts through June 2009, declines in forecasts in rig activity for the remainder of 2009, 2010, and 2011 compared to rig count forecast at the beginning of 2009 and a decline in the revenue forecast for the drill pipe business unit for the remainder of 2009, 2010, and 2011. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company further updated its impairment testing using current operating forecasts and discounted cash flows. In the third and fourth quarters of 2009, both rig activity and commodity prices began to increase. Rig count increased 4% to an average of 2,130 in the third quarter and increased another 13% to an average of 2,397 in the fourth quarter. Average West Texas Intermediate Crude prices reached $76.06 in the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of 28% from an average of $59.44 in the second quarter of 2009. In addition, by the end of the fourth quarter, average natural gas prices increased to $4.34, a 17% increase from the second quarter 2009 average of $3.71. The impairment analysis that we performed during the fourth quarter of 2009 resulted in no impairment of the Companys goodwill and no additional impairment for the Companys other indefinite lived intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2009. Along with the normal impairment analysis, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis on the projected results, the goodwill and the other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis assuming revenue for each individual reporting unit for goodwill and each individual indefinite lived intangible asset decreased an additional 20% from the current projections for 2010, 2011 and 2012, while holding all other factors constant and no impairment was identified. Additionally, if the Company were to increase its discount rate 100 basis points, while keeping all other assumptions constant, there would be no impairments in any of the goodwill associated with the Companys reporting units or any of the Companys indefinite lived intangible assets. While the Company does not believe that these events (20% drop in additional revenue for the next three years or 100 basis point increases in weighted average costs of capital) or changes are likely to occur, it is reasonably possible these events could transpire if market conditions worsen and if the market fails to continue to recover in 2010 and or 2011. Any significant changes to these assumptions and factors could have a material impact on the Companys goodwill impairment analysis. Inherent in our projections are key assumptions relative to how long the current downward cycle might last. Service and Product Warranties The Company provides service and warranty policies on certain of its products. The Company accrues liabilities under service and warranty policies based upon specific claims and a review of historical warranty and service claim experience in accordance with ASC Topic 450 Contingencies (ASC Topic 450). Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience change. In addition, the Company incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues and accrues for them when they are encountered. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, service and product warranties totaled $217 million and $114 million, respectively. 47 Table of Contents Income Taxes The Company is a U.S. registered company and is subject to income taxes in the U.S. The Company operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. Income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates of the countries in which the Company operates and income is earned. The Companys annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income, statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The determination and evaluation of the annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. It requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of income, deductions and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or the Companys level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could impact the tax liability in any given year. The Company also operates in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the pricing of transactions between related parties are open to interpretation, which could potentially result in aggressive tax authorities asserting additional tax liabilities with no offsetting tax recovery in other countries. The Company maintains liabilities for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation. The annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that the Company considers appropriate, as well as related interest. Tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing and certain operating expenses that may not be deductible in foreign jurisdictions. These exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means. The Company is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions which may result in proposed assessments. The Company believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures under the guidance in ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes (ASC Topic 740). However, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The Company reviews these liabilities quarterly and to the extent audits or other events result in an adjustment to the liability accrued for a prior year, the effect will be recognized in the period of the event. The Company currently has recorded valuation allowances that the Company intends to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in the Companys valuation allowances. The realization of remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that the Company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings. The Company has not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested. Should the Company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries, the Company may be required to record additional taxes. Unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries were $2,764 million and $2,255 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company makes an annual determination whether to permanently reinvest these earnings. If, as a result of these reassessments, the Company distributes these earnings in the future, additional tax liability would result, offset by any available foreign tax credits. The Company does not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability, if any, is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated. These include, among others, the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities; the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process; the impartiality of the local courts; and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce, or fail to produce, an offsetting tax change in other countries. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In April 2009 the FASB issued ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC Topic 805). ASC Topic 805 amends the provisions for the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosures for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations. ASC Topic 805 is effective for contingent assets and contingent liabilities acquired in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company expects ASC Topic 805 will have a future impact on its consolidated financial statements, but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature, term and size of the acquired contingencies. In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments (ASC Topic 825). ASC Topic 825 extends the annual disclosure requirements regarding the fair value of financial instruments to interim financial statements of publicly traded companies. ASC Topic 825 is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. On June 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 825. There was no significant impact to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements from the adoption of ASC Topic 825. 48 Table of Contents In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events (ASC Topic 855). ASC Topic 855 requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. ASC Topic 855 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ending after June 15, 2009. On June 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 855. There was no significant impact to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements from the adoption of ASC Topic 855. In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (ASC Topic 105). The ASC is now the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. On the effective date, ASC Topic 105 superseded all then existing non SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other non grandfathered non SEC accounting literature not included in the ASC has become non authoritative. ASC Topic 105 became effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. Forward Looking Statements Some of the information in this document contains, or has incorporated by reference, forward looking statements. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements typically are identified by use of terms such as may, will, expect, anticipate, estimate, and similar words, although some forward looking statements are expressed differently. All statements herein regarding expected merger synergies are forward looking statements. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from results anticipated in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in oil and gas prices, customer demand for our products and worldwide economic activity. You should also consider carefully the statements under Risk Factors which address additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward looking statements. Given these uncertainties, current or prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any such factors or forward looking statements to reflect future events or developments. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Additional information concerning each of these matters follows: Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We have extensive operations in foreign countries. The net assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, although such fluctuations generally do not affect income since their functional currency is typically the local currency. These operations also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency, which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company reported foreign currency gains (losses) of ($79) million, $50 million, and ($7) million, respectively. The gains and losses are primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and in 2009 adjustments to our hedged positions as a result of the current economic environment. Strengthening of currencies against the U.S. dollar may create losses in future periods to the extent we maintain net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the countries using the local currency as their functional currency. Some of our revenues in foreign countries are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those U.S. dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency. Similarly some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, but have associated U.S. dollar costs, which also give rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure. In order to mitigate that risk, we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. The following table details the Companys foreign currency exchange risk grouped by functional currency and their expected maturity periods as of December 31, 2009 (in millions except for rates): As of December 31, 2009 December 31, Functional Currency 2010 2011 2012 Total 2008 CAD Buy USD/Sell CAD: Notional amount to buy (in Canadian dollars) 291 291 527 Average CAD to USD contract rate 1.0418 1.0418 1.1843 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 2 2 14 Sell USD/Buy CAD: Notional amount to sell (in Canadian dollars) 69 69 241 Average CAD to USD contract rate 1.1109 1.1109 1.1196 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 4 4 (18 ) EUR Buy USD/Sell EUR: Notional amount to buy (in euros) 98 98 11 Average USD to EUR contract rate 1.4356 1.4356 1.4397 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars Sell USD/Buy EUR: Notional amount to buy (in euros) 90 1 91 245 Average USD to EUR contract rate 1.3892 1.4324 1.3896 1.3986 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 4 4 1 KRW Sell EUR/Buy KRW: Notional amount to buy (in South Korean won) 4,777 273 5,050 Average KRW to EUR contract rate 1.633 1.743 1.6390 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 50 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009 December 31, Functional Currency 2010 2011 2012 Total 2008 Sell USD/Buy KRW: Notional amount to buy (in South Korean won) 88,183 61,779 3,264 153,226 Average KRW to USD contract rate 1.019 1.084 1.118 1.0460 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars (12 ) (6 ) (18 ) GBP Buy USD/Sell GBP: Notional amount to buy (in British Pounds Sterling) 11 11 Average USD to GBP contract rate 1.5880 1.5880 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars Sell USD/Buy GBP: Notional amount to buy (in British Pounds Sterling) 2 2 34 Average USD to GBP contract rate 1.5313 1.5313 1.5647 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars (4 ) USD Buy DKK/Sell USD: Notional amount to buy (in U.S. dollars) 44 44 47 Average DKK to USD contract rate 5.1219 5.1219 5.4968 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars (1 ) (1 ) 2 Buy EUR/Sell USD: Notional amount to buy (in U.S. dollars) 374 8 382 749 Average USD to EUR contract rate 1.4588 1.4150 1.4578 1.3791 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars (7 ) (7 ) 14 Buy GBP/Sell USD: Notional amount to buy (in U.S. dollars) 76 76 108 Average USD to GBP contract rate 1.6348 1.6348 1.5623 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars (2 ) (2 ) (8 ) Buy NOK/Sell USD: Notional amount to buy (in U.S. dollars) 783 311 1,094 1,325 Average NOK to USD contract rate 6.2161 6.2541 6.2269 6.5338 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 49 18 67 (101 ) Sell DKK/Buy USD: Notional amount to buy (in U.S. dollars) 6 6 Average DKK to USD contract rate 5.0009 5.0009 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars Sell EUR/Buy USD: Notional amount to sell (in U.S. dollars) 53 3 56 76 Average USD to EUR contract rate 1.4444 1.2715 1.4324 1.3777 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars (2 ) Sell NOK/Buy USD: Notional amount to sell (in U.S. dollars) 408 408 589 Average NOK to USD contract rate 5.8307 5.8307 5.8647 Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 104 Other Currencies Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 1 (1 ) Total Fair Value at December 31, 2009 in U.S. dollars 38 11 49 2 The Company had other financial market risk sensitive instruments denominated in foreign currencies totaling $75 million as of December 31, 2009 excluding trade receivables and payables, which approximate fair value. These market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances and overdraft facilities. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on these financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect net income by $5 million. 51 Table of Contents The counterparties to forward contracts are major financial institutions. The credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis. In the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract, our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential. We assess the functional currencies of our operating units to ensure that the appropriate currencies are utilized in accordance with the guidance of ASC Topic 830 Foreign Currency Matters. Effective January 1, 2008, we changed the functional currency of our Rig Technology unit in Norway from the Norwegian krone to the U.S. dollar to more appropriately reflect the primary economic environment in which they operate. This change was precipitated by significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances, including: the increased order rate for large drilling platforms and components technology, the use of our Norway unit as our preferred project manager of these projects, increasing revenue and cost base in U.S. dollars, and the implementation of an international cash pool denominated in U.S. dollars. As a Norwegian krone functional unit, Norway was subject to increasing foreign currency exchange risk as a result of these changes in its economic environment and was dependent upon significant hedging transactions to offset its non functional currency positions. At December 31, 2007, our Norway operations had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating $2,551 million with a fair value of $91 million to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk against the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency. Effective with the change in the functional currency, the Company terminated these hedges. The related net gain position of $109 million associated with the terminated hedges has been deferred and is being recognized into earnings in the future period(s) the forecasted transactions affect earnings, of which $10 million remains to be recognized into future earnings at December 31, 2009. The Company has subsequent to January 1, 2008, entered into new hedges to cover the exposures as a result of the changes to U.S. dollar functional. At December 31, 2009, our Norway operations had derivatives with $2,024 million in notional value with a fair value of $58 million, included in the table above. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2009 our long term borrowings consisted of $150 million in 6.5% Senior Notes, $200 million in 7.25% Senior Notes, $200 million in 5.65% Senior Notes, $150 million in 5.5% Senior Notes and $151 million in 6.125% Senior Notes. We occasionally have borrowings under our credit facility, and a portion of these borrowings could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market risk with exchange rate movements. These instruments carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from LIBOR, NIBOR or EURIBOR, or at the prime interest rate. Under our credit facility, we may, at our option, fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over LIBOR, NIBOR or EURIBOR for 30 days to 6 months. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General Overview The Company is a leading worldwide provider of highly engineered drilling and well servicing equipment, products and services to the exploration and production segments of the oil and gas industry. With operations in over 825 locations across six continents, we design, manufacture and service a comprehensive line of drilling and well servicing equipment; sell and rent drilling motors, specialized downhole tools, and rig instrumentation; perform inspection and internal coating of oilfield tubular products; provide drill cuttings separation, management and disposal systems and services; provide expendables and spare parts used in conjunction with our large installed base of equipment; and provide supply chain management services through our distribution network. We also manufacture coiled tubing, manufacture high pressure fiberglass and composite tubing, and sell and rent advanced in line inspection equipment to makers of oil country tubular goods. We have a long tradition of pioneering innovations which improve the cost effectiveness, efficiency, safety, and environmental impact of oil and gas operations. Our revenues and operating results are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling and production activities and the profitability and cash flow of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, which in turn are affected by current and anticipated prices of oil and gas. Oil and gas prices have been and are likely to continue to be volatile. See Risk Factors. We conduct our operations through three business segments: Rig Technology, Petroleum Services Supplies and Distribution Services. See Item 1. Business for a discussion of each of these business segments. Operating Environment Overview Our results are dependent on, among other things, the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling, well remediation activity, the price of crude oil and natural gas, capital spending by other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors, and the worldwide oil and gas inventory levels. Key industry indicators for the past three years include the following: % % 2009 v 2009 v 2009* 2008* 2007* 2008 2007 Active Drilling Rigs: U.S. 1,086 1,878 1,767 (42.2 %) (38.5 %) Canada 221 379 344 (41.7 %) (35.8 %) International 997 1,079 1,005 (7.6 %) (0.8 %) Worldwide 2,304 3,336 3,116 (30.9 %) (26.1 %) West Texas Intermediate Crude Prices (per barrel) $ 61.65 $ 99.63 $ 72.33 (38.1 %) (14.8 %) Natural Gas Prices ($/mmbtu) $ 3.95 $ 8.86 $ 6.97 (55.4 %) (43.3 %) * Averages for the years indicated. See sources below. 34 Table of Contents The following table details the U.S., Canadian, and international rig activity and West Texas Intermediate Oil prices for the past nine quarters ended December 31, 2009 on a quarterly basis: Source: Rig count: Baker Hughes, Inc. (www.bakerhughes.com); West Texas Intermediate Crude Price: Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (www.eia.doe.gov). The average price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate Crude was $61.65 per barrel in 2009, a decrease of 38.1% over the average price for 2008 of $99.63 per barrel. Average natural gas prices were $3.95 per mmbtu, a decrease of 55.4% compared to the 2008 average of $8.86 per mmbtu. Lower oil prices led to reduced rig activity worldwide, decreasing 30.9% for the full year in 2009 compared to 2008. Average crude oil prices for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $76.06 per barrel and natural gas was $4.34 per mmbtu. At February 5, 2010, there were 1,335 rigs actively drilling in the U.S., compared to 1,189 rigs at December 31, 2009; an increase of 12.3% from year end 2009 levels. The price of oil and gas had dropped to $71.15 per barrel and $5.52 per mmbtu, respectively, at February 5, 2010 representing 10.4% (oil) and 5.2% (gas) declines from the end of 2009. 35 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY National Oilwell Varco produced $1.5 billion in net income or $3.52 per fully diluted share in 2009. Revenues of $12.7 billion declined five percent from 2008 as stated, but declined nine percent when including full year 2008 pro forma sales for Grant Prideco, which the Company acquired in April 2008. Operating profit was $2.3 billion in 2009, compared to $2.9 billion in 2008. Generally 2009 was a more challenging year than 2008, as a worldwide recession led to lower demand for oil and gas and lower commodity prices, which led in turn to lower oil and gas drilling activity. This development negatively affected many of our businesses, but was partly offset by results from our Rig Technology segment which carried a high level of contracted work into the year, and produced higher year over year revenues. Profitability was adversely affected by intangible asset impairment, transaction, voluntary early retirement and other restructuring charges in 2009 that totaled $234 million pre tax or $0.37 per dilutive share after tax. Excluding these items earnings would have been $3.89 per diluted share. For its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, National Oilwell Varco generated earnings of $394 million or $0.94 per fully diluted share, on revenues of $3.1 billion. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 revenue declined 18 percent and net income attributable to the Company declined 33 percent. Compared to the third quarter of 2009 revenue increased two percent and net income attributable to the Company increased two percent. Fourth quarter 2009 operating profit was $622 million or 19.8 percent of sales, compared to $618 million or 20.0 percent of sales in the third quarter of 2009, and $877 million or 23.0 percent of sales in the fourth quarter of 2008, excluding transaction and restructuring charges from all periods. Year over year quarterly declines across all segments were a result of lower activity and pricing in most oilfield markets. The modest sequential improvement in the fourth quarter of 2009 was driven by higher sequential activity in North American markets driving better results from the Companys Petroleum Services Supplies and Distribution Services segments, offset by slightly lower results from Rig Technology. Oil Gas Equipment and Services Market Worldwide developed economies turned down sharply late in 2008 as looming housing related asset write downs at major financial institutions paralyzed credit markets and sparked a serious global banking crisis. Major central banks have responded vigorously, but credit and financial markets have not yet fully recovered, and a credit driven worldwide economic recession deepened during the second quarter. Asset and commodity prices, including oil and gas prices, have declined sharply. After rising steadily for six years to peak at around $147 per barrel earlier in 2008, oil prices collapsed back to average $42.91 per barrel during the first quarter of 2009, but have been recovering steadily to average $76.06 per barrel during the fourth quarter of 2009. Higher oil and gas prices over the past several years led to high levels of exploration and development drilling in many oil and gas basins around the globe by 2008, but activity slowed sharply in 2009 with lower oil and gas prices and tightening credit availability. The count of rigs actively drilling in the U.S. as measured by Baker Hughes (a good measure of the level of oilfield activity and spending) peaked at 2,031 rigs in September 2008, but decreased to a low of 876 in June 2009. Rig count has increased to 1,335 in February 2010, and averaged 1,108 rigs during the fourth quarter of 2009. Many oil and gas operators reliant on external financing to fund their drilling programs significantly curtailed their drilling activity earlier in the year, but drilling appears to be recovering across North America as gas prices firmed above $4.00 per mmbtu (the fourth quarter average was $4.34 per mmbtu). Most international activity is driven by oil exploration and production by national oil companies, which has historically been less susceptible to short term commodity price swings, but the international rig count has exhibited modest declines nonetheless, falling from its September 2008 peak of 1,108 to 986 in September 2009, but recently climbing back to 1,047 in January 2010. During the year the Company saw its Petroleum Services Supplies and its Distribution Services margins affected most acutely by a drilling downturn, through both volume and price declines; nevertheless, both of these segments saw prices stabilize and revenues recover modestly from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. The Companys Rig Technology segment was less impacted through the year owing to its high level of contracted backlog and strong execution during the year. Recent downturns followed an extended period of high drilling activity which fueled strong demand for oilfield services between 2003 and 2008. Incremental drilling activity through the upswing shifted toward harsh environments, employing increasingly sophisticated technology to find and produce reserves. Higher utilization of drilling rigs tested the capability of the worlds fleet of rigs, much of which is old and of limited capability. Technology has advanced significantly since most of the existing rig fleet was built. The industry invested little during the late 1980s and 1990s on new drilling equipment, but drilling technology progressed steadily nonetheless, as the Company and its competitors continued to invest in new and better ways of drilling. As a consequence, the safety, reliability, and efficiency of new, modern rigs surpass the performance of most of the older rigs at work today. Drilling rigs are now being pushed to drill deeper wells, more complex wells, highly deviated wells and horizontal wells, tasks which require larger rigs with more capabilities. The drilling process effectively consumes the mechanical components of a rig, which wear out and need periodic repair or replacement. This process was accelerated by very high rig utilization and wellbore complexity. Drilling consumes rigs; more complex and challenging drilling consumes rigs faster. 36 Table of Contents The industry responded by launching many new rig construction projects since 2005 to: 1.) retool the existing fleet of jackup rigs (according to Offshore Data Services, 72 percent of the existing 457 jackup rigs are more than 25 years old); 2.) replace older mechanical and DC electric land rigs with improved AC power, electronic controls, automatic pipe handling and rapid rigup and rigdown technology; and 3.) build out additional deepwater floating drilling rigs, including semisubmersibles and drillships, to employ recent advancements in deepwater drilling to exploit unexplored deepwater basins. We believe that the newer rigs offer considerably higher efficiency, safety, and capability, and that many will effectively replace a portion of the existing fleet, and that declining dayrates may accelerate the retirement of older rigs. As a result of these trends the Companys Rig Technology segment grew its backlog of capital equipment orders from $0.9 billion at March 31, 2005, to $11.8 billion at September 30, 2008. However, as a result of the credit crisis and slowing drilling activity, orders have declined below amounts flowing out of backlog as revenue, causing the backlog to decline to $6.4 billion at December 31, 2009. The land rig backlog comprised 11 percent, and equipment destined for offshore operations comprised 89 percent of the total backlog as of December 31, 2009. Equipment destined for international markets totaled 92 percent of the backlog. The Company believes that its existing contracts for rig equipment are very strong in that they carry significant down payment and progress billing terms favorable to the ultimate completion of these projects, and generally do not allow customers to cancel projects for convenience. During 2009 the Company removed $259 million in discontinued orders on cancelled projects and project change orders requested by customers. We do not expect the credit crisis or softer market to result in additional material cancellation of contracts or abandonment of major projects; however, there can be no assurance that such discontinuance of projects will not occur. The Company had approximately $274 million of projects in its December 31, 2009 backlog that it considers at risk. Segment Performance Rig Technology generated a record $8.1 billion in revenue and $2.3 billion in operating profit in 2009, producing operating margins for the segment of 28.2 percent, excluding transaction and restructuring charges. The segment generated 55 percent operating profit leverage or flow through (the change in operating profit divided by the change in revenue period to period) on eight percent higher sales as compared to 2008, excluding charges. Revenue out of backlog of $6.2 billion increased 18 percent from the prior year. Execution of the backlog orders was very strong, which led to higher margin performance for the Rig Technology segment in the third quarter due to excellent cost control, deflation in certain inputs, greater experience building and commissioning rigs which enables better efficiencies, and somewhat better foreign currency exchange movements. As a result our estimated costs to complete projects declined steadily through 2009. As of December 31, 2009 the scheduled outflow of revenue from backlog is expected to be approximately $4.6 billion in 2010, and $1.5 billion for 2011, and $0.3 billion in 2012. From 2005 through the current quarter, the segment has delivered over 70 newly built offshore rigs. Aftermarket spare parts and services revenue was $1.4 billion in 2009 or 17 percent of total segment sales. The balance of Rig Technology revenues were smaller capital items which the Company does not book into its backlog. These items were adversely affected by lower purchases by many land contractors in view of markedly softer drilling demand during the year. Demand for offshore rigs and equipment is strongest in Brazil, owing to significant drilling equipment needs to develop new ultradeepwater discoveries, and the segment also continues to pursue a variety of new offshore rig, intervention vessel, FPSO and platform upgrade opportunities in other markets. However, tight credit markets and fewer committed term contracts for rigs by oil and gas companies as compared to market conditions in 2006 2008 are adversely affecting new orders. Demand for land rig and well stimulation equipment has also been very slow, except for the Middle East and certain Latin American markets, but resumed late in the year in the U.S. Additionally, demand for coiled tubing units and pressure pumping equipment for both North America and international markets also recovered late in the year. The Petroleum Services Supplies segment generated revenues of $3.7 billion and operating profit of $0.5 billion or 12.1 percent of sales in 2009, excluding impairment, transaction and restructuring charges. Revenues declined 29 percent from 2008, when including pro forma revenue for Grant Prideco, and decremental operating leverage or flow through was 55 percent from 2008, excluding charges, due to a high level of price discounting on most products and services through the year. Prices appeared to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2009, settling roughly 25 percent below peak pricing levels of 2008 (although some products and services are at greater, and some at lesser, levels of discounting). Sharply rising North American rig counts led to modestly tightening supplies of many of the segments products, which contributed to the stabilization. As working rigs were stacked during 2009 their owners tended to cannibalize consumables and smaller capital items from these rather than purchase goods from the Company. During the fourth quarter some of these rigs were restocked with new goods, which led to new orders for the Company and benefitted its fourth quarter results in North America. International demand remained somewhat stable, and did not turn down as sharply earlier in the year as gas driven North American drilling. Drill pipe sales remain challenged due to the large amount of idle drill pipe inventory remaining with drilling contractors. Nevertheless, drill pipe margins have remained good due to lower costs and a positive mix shift toward premium drill pipe, for new offshore rigs being delivered, and for complex horizontal and extended reach drilling programs onshore. We do not expect drill pipe demand to recover significantly until inventories are depleted through consumption, late in 2010 at the earliest. In total the Petroleum Services Supplies segment generated approximately 47 percent of its sales into North American markets, and 53 percent of its sales into international markets, during 2009. 37 Table of Contents The Distribution Services segment generated total sales of $1.4 billion in 2009, down 24 percent from 2008 sales. Operating profit excluding transaction and restructuring charges was $50 million or 3.7 percent of sales. Decremental operating leverage or flow through was 19 percent on the $422 million sales decline from the prior year, higher than the segments historical average, due largely to price discounting in North America, which comprised 70 percent of the segments revenue in 2009. The segments lower results were driven by a much lower level of drilling activity, which led to intense price pressure and lower volumes for the group. International results were generally much more stable in 2009 as compared to 2008, as higher sales of artificial lift products into Latin America helped offset declines elsewhere. The segment posted 8 percent higher quarterly sequential results in the fourth quarter of 2009 as the North American rig count moved up sharply and customers ordered MRO supplies for rigs going back to work. Specifically new unconventional shale gas fields in the Marcellus, Haynesville, Bakken and other areas led most of the recovery. Outlook The credit market downturn, global recession, and lower commodity prices presented significant challenges to our business in 2009. Consequently we remain cautious in our outlook for 2010, but we believe we are seeing signs of stabilization in many of our markets, and are encouraged by limited demand growth in North America seen late in the year. Order levels for new drilling rigs declined significantly in 2009 as compared to 2008, but we continue to bid a number of large projects, including up to 28 new offshore floating rigs to be built in Brazil. We are hopeful that these will translate into more orders during the coming year, assuming, among other things, that rig dayrates generally hold up well; that commodity prices remain high; and that broad economic conditions do not deteriorate further. North American land gas drilling activity, particularly by independent gas producers reliant on external financing, fell sharply early in 2009, but we believe better commodity prices are leading to recovery as we enter 2010. Our outlook for international markets, which are more driven by national oil company activity and are historically less volatile, remains good owing to high and stable oil price levels established through the second half of 2009. Our outlook for the Companys Petroleum Services Supplies segment and Distribution Services segment remains closely tied to the rig count, particularly in North America. If the rig count continues to increase we expect these segments to benefit from higher demand for the services, consumables and capital items they supply. The Rig Technology segment was less affected by the downturn during 2009 due to the strength of its backlog, but as the backlog has declined we expect to see revenues and margins decline through 2010 as well. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced a currency devaluation which included a two tier exchange rate system. The Company has net assets employed in Venezuela of approximately $80 million, and generated revenue and operating profit of approximately $75 million and $10 million, respectively, in 2009. We expect to incur a pre tax charge between $20 million and $30 million in the first quarter of 2010 related to the impact of the currency devaluation and changes to social regulations impacting our operations in Venezuela. The Company believes it is well positioned to continue to manage through this downturn, and should benefit from its strong balance sheet and capitalization, access to credit, and a high level of contracted orders which are expected to continue to generate earnings in the coming year. The Company has a long history of cost control and downsizing in response to depressed market conditions, and of executing strategic acquisitions during difficult periods. Such a period may present opportunities to the Company to effect new organic growth and acquisition initiatives, and we remain hopeful that a downturn will generate new opportunities. 38 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 The following table summarizes the Companys revenue and operating profit by operating segment in 2009 and 2008. The actual results include results from Grant Prideco operations from the acquisition date of April 21, 2008 (in millions): Years Ended December 31, Variance 2009 2008 $ % Revenue: Rig Technology $ 8,093 $ 7,528 $ 565 7.5 % Petroleum Services Supplies 3,745 4,651 (906 ) (19.5 %) Distribution Services 1,350 1,772 (422 ) (23.8 %) Eliminations (476 ) (520 ) 44 (8.5 %) Total Revenue $ 12,712 $ 13,431 $ (719 ) (5.4 %) Operating Profit: Rig Technology $ 2,283 $ 1,970 $ 313 15.9 % Petroleum Services Supplies 301 1,044 (743 ) (71.2 %) Distribution Services 50 130 (80 ) (61.5 %) Unallocated expenses and eliminations (319 ) (226 ) (93 ) 41.2 % Total Operating Profit $ 2,315 $ 2,918 $ (603 ) (20.7 %) Operating Profit %: Rig Technology 28.2 % 26.2 % Petroleum Services Supplies 8.0 % 22.4 % Distribution Services 3.7 % 7.3 % Total Operating Profit % 18.2 % 21.7 % Rig Technology Rig Technology revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $8,093 million, an increase of $565 million (7.5%) compared to 2008. Revenue out of backlog increased $934 million or 18% from 2008 due to an increase in the number of large rig projects delivered this year. Non backlog revenue decreased $369 million or 17% compared to 2008, largely due to lower spare parts and capital equipment sales as North American land drillers and pressure pumpers decreased their capital spending in 2009. Operating profit from Rig Technology was $2,283 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $313 million (15.9%) over the same period of 2008. Operating profit percentage increased to 28.2%, up from 26.2% in 2008 primarily due to the increased manufacturing efficiencies and revision of cost estimates on large rig projects as a result of favorable pricing from vendors. The Rig Technology group monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when we receive a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $6.4 billion at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $4.7 billion (42.3%) from backlog of $11.1 billion at December 31, 2008. Approximately $4.6 billion of the current backlog is expected to be delivered in 2010. Petroleum Services Supplies Revenue from Petroleum Services Supplies was $3,745 million for 2009 compared to $4,651 million for 2008, a decrease of $906 million (19.5%). The decrease was primarily attributable to a 42% decline in North American average rig count activity in 2009 compared to 2008. Operating profit from Petroleum Services Supplies was $301 million for 2009 compared to $1,044 million for 2008, a decrease of $743 million (71.2%). Operating profit percentage decreased to 8.0% down from 22.4% in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to reduced North American rig count activity combined with strong price competition. In addition, a $147 million impairment charge was incurred on the carrying value of a trade name associated with this segment in the second quarter of 2009. 39 Table of Contents Distribution Services Revenue from Distribution Services totaled $1,350 million for 2009, a decrease of $422 million (23.8%) from 2008. The decrease in revenue is mainly concentrated in the North American region as average drilling activity declined 42% in 2009 compared to the prior year. Operating profit decreased in 2009 to $50 million compared to $130 million in 2008. Operating profit percentage decreased to 3.7% in 2009 from 7.3% in 2008 as a result of strong price competition and volume declines as North American rig activity declined. Unallocated expenses and eliminations Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $319 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $226 million for 2008. The increase in unallocated expenses and eliminations was primarily due to the voluntary retirement costs of $46 million. Acquisition costs also contributed to the increase from 2008. Interest and financial costs Interest and financial costs were $53 million for 2009 compared to $67 million for 2008. The decrease in interest and financial costs were primarily a direct result of the repayment of borrowings on the Companys credit facility used to purchase Grant Prideco, the repayment of the Companys 7.5% Senior Notes and the repayment of a portion of the Companys 6.125% Senior Notes. These repayments occurred during 2008 causing lower debt levels in 2009. Equity Income in Unconsolidated Affiliate Equity income in unconsolidated affiliate was $47 million for 2009 compared to $42 million for 2008 and was related to the April 21, 2008 acquisition of Grant Prideco. The income was related to the equity earnings from the Companys 50.01% investment in Voest Alpine Tubulars (VAT) located in Kindberg, Austria. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net was expense, net of $110 million in 2009 compared to income, net of $23 million in 2008. The 2009 expense was primarily due to a net foreign exchange loss of $79 million, as compared to a net foreign exchange gain of $50 million in 2008. The 2009 foreign exchange losses were primarily due to adjustments of our hedge positions as a result of the current economic environment and the strengthening of the Euro, the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone compared to the U.S. dollar. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Rates. Provision for income taxes The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 33.3% compared to 33.5% for 2008. The tax rate includes $21 million of additional tax provision recognized in the second quarter 2009 on prior year income in Norway. These additional taxes resulted from foreign currency gains on dollar denominated accounts that were realized for Norwegian tax purposes. The Company expects its income tax rate to be in the 30% to 32% range in 2010. 40 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 The following table summarizes the Companys revenue and operating profit by operating segment in 2008 and 2007. The actual results include results from Grant Prideco operations from the acquisition date of April 21, 2008 (in millions): Years Ended December 31, Variance 2008 2007 $ % Revenue: Rig Technology $ 7,528 $ 5,745 $ 1,783 31.0 % Petroleum Services Supplies 4,651 3,061 1,590 51.9 % Distribution Services 1,772 1,424 348 24.4 % Eliminations (520 ) (441 ) (79 ) 17.9 % Total Revenue $ 13,431 $ 9,789 $ 3,642 37.2 % Operating Profit: Rig Technology $ 1,970 $ 1,394 $ 576 41.3 % Petroleum Services Supplies 1,044 732 312 42.6 % Distribution Services 130 94 36 38.3 % Unallocated expenses and eliminations (226 ) (176 ) (50 ) 28.4 % Total Operating Profit $ 2,918 $ 2,044 $ 874 42.8 % Operating Profit %: Rig Technology 26.2 % 24.3 % Petroleum Services Supplies 22.4 % 23.9 % Distribution Services 7.3 % 6.6 % Total Operating Profit % 21.7 % 20.9 % Rig Technology Rig Technology revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $7,528 million, an increase of $1,783 million (31.0%) compared to 2007. Revenue out of backlog increased $1,217 million or 29.8% from 2007 due to the growing market for capital equipment, as evidenced by backlog growth during the first three quarters of 2008. The increase in orders and backlog resulted from continued capital investments by drilling contractors in 2008, primarily related to the international offshore market. Non backlog revenue increased $567 million or 34.1% over 2007, largely due to increased spare parts sales and service revenues related to the increased drilling activity during the year. Operating profit from Rig Technology was $1,970 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $576 million (41.3%) over the same period of 2007. The increase in operating profit was largely due to the increased activity discussed above as well as improved pricing on large rig contracts and aftermarket products. The Rig Technology group monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when we receive a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $11.1 billion at December 31, 2008, an increase of $2.1 billion (23.3%) over backlog of $9.0 billion at December 31, 2007. Petroleum Services Supplies Revenue from Petroleum Services Supplies was $4,651 million for 2008 compared to $3,061 million for 2007, an increase of $1,590 million (51.9%). The increase was mostly attributable to the acquisition of Grant Prideco which contributed sales of $1,435 million since the acquisition date of April 21, 2008. Higher demand for most of the products and services offered by the segment also contributed to the higher revenue compared to 2007. Rig count in North America and international markets during 2008 were up 6.9% and 7.3%, respectively, compared to 2007 averages, prompting higher demand from our services group. Operating profit from Petroleum Services Supplies was $1,044 million for 2008 compared to $732 million for 2007, an increase of $312 million (42.6%). Grant Prideco contributed $297 million of operating profit since April 21, 2008. Included in the Grant Prideco operating profit was $89 million of expense recorded in cost of revenue that resulted from the fair value step up of inventory as part of the purchase accounting valuation of Grant Prideco. The increase was also attributable to higher profitability across most product lines. 41 Table of Contents Distribution Services Revenue from Distribution Services totaled $1,772 million in 2008, an increase of $348 million (24.4%) from the prior period. The number of drilling rigs actively searching for oil and gas is a key metric for this business segment. Worldwide rig count increased 7.1% in 2008 compared to 2007, with increases of 10.3%, 7.3% and 6.3% in Canada, international and the U.S. rig activity, respectively. The Companys Distribution Services segment continued efforts to expand in international markets resulted in a 25% increase in international revenue. The expansion primarily consisted of opening rig stores or facilities that maintain levels of consumables used on rigs, in centrally located areas. In addition, the Company has begun to open stores on individual rigs. After opening its first rig store in 2007, the Company opened eight additional stores during 2008 continuing the efforts to expand its presence both in the U.S. and internationally. Operating income increased in 2008 to $130 million compared to $94 million in 2007. Margins increased slightly to 7.3% of revenue in 2008 compared to 6.6% of revenue in 2007. The increase in margin was primarily due to the cost reduction actions taken in Canada to offset the weakening demand seen in the later part of 2007 combined with the increase in profit margins from international locations. Unallocated expenses and eliminations Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $226 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $176 million for 2007. The increase in unallocated expenses and eliminations was primarily due to greater inter segment profit eliminations and greater stock based compensation expense. The stock based compensation expense was $61 million and $43 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2008 results also included $11 million of integration costs related to the 2008 acquisition of Grant Prideco. Interest and financial costs Interest and financial costs were $67 million for 2008 compared to $50 million for 2007. The increase was primarily due to the borrowings related to the merger with Grant Prideco. Equity Income in Unconsolidated Affiliate Equity income in unconsolidated affiliate was $42 million for 2008 and was related to the April 21, 2008 acquisition of Grant Prideco. The income was related to the equity earnings from the Companys 50.01% investment in Voest Alpine Tubulars (VAT) located in Kindberg, Austria. The Companys investment in VAT is accounted for under the equity method of accounting due to the minority owner having substantive participating rights. Step up depreciation and amortization of $8 million was recorded in 2008 related to VAT and charges of $11 million were recorded related to inventory step up. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net was an income, net of $23 million and an expense of $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. The 2008 income was primarily due to a net foreign exchange gain which was $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The 2008 foreign exchange gains were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone compared to the U.S. dollar. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Rates. Provision for income taxes The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 33.5% compared to 33.3% for 2007. The 2008 rate reflects increasing benefits in the U.S. from the tax incentive for manufacturing activities and a higher percentage of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. This was partially offset by additional tax provisions related to the Companys decision to repatriate earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries during the year and net higher tax expense in Norway related to movement in exchange rates after the change of the functional currency to the U.S. dollar. The net additional tax expense in Norway included a $46 million charge resulting from realized foreign exchange gains on U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities. This was partially offset by a $30 million benefit for the same period, which was reported as provision for income tax, from the remeasurement into U.S. dollars of foreign currency denominated deferred tax assets and liabilities in the balance sheet. 42 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2009, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2,622 million, and total debt of $883 million. At December 31, 2008, cash and cash equivalents were $1,543 million and total debt was $874 million. A portion of the consolidated cash balances are maintained in accounts in various foreign subsidiaries and, if such amounts were transferred among countries or repatriated to the U.S., such amounts may be subject to additional tax obligations. The Companys outstanding debt at December 31, 2009 consisted of $200 million of 5.65% Senior Notes due 2012, $200 million of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2011, $150 million of 6.5% Senior Notes due 2011, $150 million of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2012, $151 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2015, and other debt of $32 million. The Company had $2,073 million of additional outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2009, primarily in Norway, that are essentially under various bilateral committed letter of credit facilities. Other letters of credit are issued as bid bonds and performance bonds. The Senior Notes contain reporting covenants and the credit facility contains a financial covenant regarding maximum debt to capitalization. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2009. There were no borrowings against the Companys unsecured credit facility, and there were $588 million in outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility, resulting in $1,412 million of funds available under the Companys unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2009. The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the periods presented (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,095 $ 2,294 $ 1,188 Net cash used in investing activities (552 ) (2,473 ) (575 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (491 ) (74 ) 150 Operating Activities Net cash flow provided by operating activities in 2009 decreased $199 million to $2,095 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $2,294 million in the same period of 2008. Before changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, cash was provided by operations primarily through net income of $1,473 million plus non cash charges of $704 million and dividends from unconsolidated affiliates of $86 million less $47 million in equity income from the Companys unconsolidated affiliate. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, used cash of $22 million during 2009, compared to $147 million used during 2008. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in 2009 was $552 million compared to net cash used in investing of $2,473 million for the same period of 2008. The primary reason for the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2009 related to a decrease in size of business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, to approximately $573 million compared to $3,008 million used in 2008 which included the purchase of the business and operating assets of Grant Prideco. Sale of equity interest provided $251 million of cash in 2009 compared to business divestitures of $801 million received in 2008 related to the disposition of certain Grant Prideco tubular businesses. In addition, the Company used $250 million for capital expenditures in 2009, compared to $379 million in 2008, received $19 million less in dividends from its unconsolidated affiliate compared to 2008, and included $86 million of the dividends from unconsolidated affiliate received in 2009 in operating activities. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities in 2009 was $491 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $74 million for the same period of 2008. The cash used in financing activities in 2009 primarily related to $460 million in cash dividends paid during the last month of 2009. In addition, cash used in financing activities in 2009 related to $47 million cash payments on debt primarily acquired in 2009 acquisitions, offset by cash proceeds from borrowings in the amount of $7 million as well as exercised stock options and excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options in the amount of $9 million. The borrowings and payments of debt in 2008 primarily relates to the financing of the Grant Prideco acquisition. For 2009, the Company used its cash on hand to fund its acquisitions. 43 Table of Contents The effect of the change in exchange rates on cash flows was a positive $27 million and a negative $46 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. We believe cash on hand, cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund operations, working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and financing obligations. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $1,412 million of available funds under its revolving credit facility. We also believe increases in capital expenditures caused by any need to increase manufacturing capacity can be funded from operations or through existing available debt financing. A summary of the Companys outstanding contractual obligations at December 31, 2009 is as follows (in millions): Payment Due by Period Less than After Total 1Year 1 3Years 4 5Years 5Years Contractual Obligations: Total debt $ 883 $ 7 $ 717 $ 6 $ 153 Operating leases 553 122 156 96 179 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,436 $ 129 $ 873 $ 102 $ 332 Commercial Commitments: Standby letters of credit $ 2,661 $ 1,762 $ 721 $ 176 $ 2 As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $58 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. We intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates, but the timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted. We expect to fund future cash acquisitions and capital spending primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings, including the unborrowed portion of the credit facility or new debt issuances, but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions. There can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us. Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing the financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition under long term construction contracts; allowance for doubtful accounts; inventory reserves; impairments of long lived assets (excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets); goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable. The combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material. Revenue Recognition under Long term Construction Contracts The Company uses the percentage of completion method to account for certain long term construction contracts in the Rig Technology group. These long term construction contracts include the following characteristics: the contracts include custom designs for customer specific applications; the structural design is unique and requires significant engineering efforts; and construction projects often have progress payments. 44 Table of Contents This method requires the Company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project, progress against the project schedule and the estimated completion date, all of which impact the amount of revenue and gross margin the Company recognizes in each reporting period. The Company prepares detailed cost to complete estimates at the beginning of each project, taking into account all factors considered likely to affect gross margin. Significant projects and their related costs and profit margins are updated and reviewed at least quarterly by senior management. Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include shipyard access, weather, production efficiencies, availability and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents and other factors as mentioned in Risk Factors. These factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the Companys estimates and materially impact the Companys future reported earnings. Historically, the Companys estimates have been reasonably dependable regarding the recognition of revenues and gross profits on percentage of completion contracts. Based upon an analysis of percentage of completion contracts for all open contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007, adjustments (representing the differences between the estimated and actual results) to all outstanding contracts resulted in net changes to gross profit margins of 1% ($53 million on $5.4 billion of outstanding contracts) and 0.8% ($31 million on $3.8 billion of outstanding contracts), respectively. While the Company believes that its estimates on outstanding contracts at December 31, 2009 and in future periods will continue to be reasonably dependable under percentage of completion accounting, the factors identified in the preceding paragraph could result in significant adjustments in future periods. The Company has recorded revenue on outstanding contracts (on a contract to date basis) of $8.6 billion at December 31, 2009. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The determination of the collectability of amounts due from customer accounts requires the Company to make judgments regarding future events and trends. Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on a continuous process of assessing the Companys portfolio on an individual customer basis taking into account current market conditions and trends. This process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, and financial condition of the Companys customers. Based on a review of these factors, the Company will establish or adjust allowances for specific customers. A substantial portion of the Companys revenues come from international oil companies, international shipyards, international oilfield service companies, and government owned or government controlled oil companies. Therefore, the Company has significant receivables in many foreign jurisdictions. If worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions deteriorate, the creditworthiness of the Companys customers could also deteriorate and they may be unable to pay these receivables, and additional allowances could be required. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, allowance for bad debts totaled $95 million and $73 million, or 4.3% and 2.3% of gross accounts receivable, respectively. Historically, the Companys charge offs and provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts have been immaterial to the Companys consolidated financial statements. However, because of the risk factors mentioned above, changes in our estimates could become material in future periods. Inventory Reserves Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The Company determines reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on hand, assumptions about future demand and market conditions, and estimates about potential alternative uses, which are usually limited. The Companys inventory consists of specialized spare parts, work in process, and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the Companys large installed base of specialized equipment used throughout the oilfield. Customers rely on the Company to stock these specialized items to ensure that their equipment can be repaired and serviced in a timely manner. The Companys estimated carrying value of inventory therefore depends upon demand driven by oil and gas drilling and well remediation activity, which depends in turn upon oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, available financing for the Companys customers, political stability in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, inventory reserves totaled $206 million and $123 million, or 5.9% and 3.1% of gross inventory, respectively. While inventory reserves and accruals have not had a material impact on the Companys financial results for the periods covered in this report, changes in worldwide oil and gas activity, or the development of new technologies which make older drilling technologies obsolete, could require the Company to record additional allowances to reduce the value of its inventory. Such changes in our estimates could be material under weaker market conditions or outlook. 45 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived Assets (Excluding Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets) Long lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and identified intangible assets, comprise a significant amount of the Companys total assets. The Company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation and amortization methods and estimated useful lives. The carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable. We estimate the fair value of these intangible and fixed assets using an income approach. This requires the Company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. These forecasts require assumptions about demand for the Companys products and services, future market conditions and technological developments. The forecasts are dependent upon assumptions regarding oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, available financing for the Companys customers, political stability in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our income forecast as well as our weighted average cost of capital, both key assumptions used in our calculation. Changes to these assumptions, including, but not limited to: further sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts, further collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas, significant additional deterioration of external financing for our customers, higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity, or any other significant adverse economic news could require a provision for impairment in a future period. Due to further significant declines in the Companys stock price and oil and gas commodity prices, coupled with unprecedented turbulence in the credit markets, the Company determined a triggering event occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. The Company performed an impairment analysis at December 31, 2008 which did not result in an impairment charge. Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets The Company has approximately $5.5 billion of goodwill and $0.6 billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of December 31, 2009. Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include, but not limited to: further sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts, further collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas, significant additional deterioration of external financing for our customers, higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity. The annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each year. Based on its analysis, the Company did not report any impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. As described below, the Company concluded that an indicator of impairment occurred in the second quarter of 2009 and updated its impairment testing at June 30, 2009. Based on its updated analysis, the Company concluded that it did not incur an impairment of goodwill for the period ended June 30, 2009. However, based on the Companys indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of 2009, the Company concluded that it incurred an impairment charge to certain indefinite lived intangible assets of $147 million at June 30, 2009. The $147 million impairment charge is included in the Companys consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, the worldwide average rig count was 2,009 rigs, down 41% from the fourth quarter 2008 average of 3,395 and down 25% from the first quarter 2009 average of 2,681. The second quarter 2009 average rig count represented the lowest quarterly average in the past six years. In addition, the Companys updated forecast was behind the Companys previous forecast completed at the beginning of 2009. While operating profit for the first quarter of 2009 was in line with the Companys first quarter 2009 operating profit forecast, the Companys consolidated operating profit for the second quarter of 2009 was below its second quarter 2009 forecast. As a result of the substantial decline in the worldwide rig count, and the decline in actual/forecasted results compared to the original 2009 forecast, the Company concluded that events or circumstances had occurred indicating that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired as described under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other. Therefore, the Company performed its interim impairment test of goodwill for all its reporting units at the end of the second quarter of 2009. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of that reporting unit as a whole. Fair value of the reporting units is determined in accordance with ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures using significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. These inputs are based on internal management estimates, forecasts and judgments, using a combination of three methods: discounted cash flow, comparable companies, and representative transactions. While the Company primarily uses the discounted cash flow method to assess fair value, the Company uses the comparable companies and representative transaction methods to validate the discounted cash flow analysis and further support managements expectations, where possible. 46 Table of Contents The discounted cash flow is based on managements short term and long term forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit. The two main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment, which bear the risk of change and could impact the Companys goodwill impairment analysis, include the cash flow from operations from each of the Companys individual business units and the weighted average cost of capital. The starting point for each of the reporting units cash flow from operations is the detailed annual plan or updated forecast. The detailed planning and forecasting process takes into consideration a multitude of factors including worldwide rig activity, inflationary forces, pricing strategies, customer analysis, operational issues, competitor analysis, capital spending requirements, working capital needs, customer needs to replace aging equipment, increased complexity of drilling, new technology, and existing backlog among other items which impact the individual reporting unit projections. Cash flows beyond the specific operating plans were estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporated historical and forecasted financial cyclical trends for each reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit changes are a short term or long term trend. Projections for the remainder of 2009 also reflected declines compared to the original 2009 annual forecast. The Company updated its 2009 operating forecast, long term forecast, and discounted cash flows based on this information. The goodwill impairment analysis that we performed during the second quarter of 2009 did not result in goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2009. Other indefinite lived intangible assets, representing trade names management intends to use indefinitely, were valued using significant unobservable inputs (level 3) and are tested for impairment using the Relief from Royalty Method, a form of the Income Approach. An impairment is measured and recognized based on the amount the book value of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds its estimated fair value as of the date of the impairment test. Included in the impairment test are assumptions, for each trade name, regarding the related revenue streams attributable to the trade names which are determined consistent with the forecasting process described above, the royalty rate, and the discount rate applied. Based on the Companys indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of 2009, the Company incurred an impairment charge of $147 million in the Petroleum Services Supplies segment related to a partial impairment of the Companys Grant Prideco trade name. The impairment charge was primarily the result of the substantial decline in worldwide rig counts through June 2009, declines in forecasts in rig activity for the remainder of 2009, 2010, and 2011 compared to rig count forecast at the beginning of 2009 and a decline in the revenue forecast for the drill pipe business unit for the remainder of 2009, 2010, and 2011. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company further updated its impairment testing using current operating forecasts and discounted cash flows. In the third and fourth quarters of 2009, both rig activity and commodity prices began to increase. Rig count increased 4% to an average of 2,130 in the third quarter and increased another 13% to an average of 2,397 in the fourth quarter. Average West Texas Intermediate Crude prices reached $76.06 in the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of 28% from an average of $59.44 in the second quarter of 2009. In addition, by the end of the fourth quarter, average natural gas prices increased to $4.34, a 17% increase from the second quarter 2009 average of $3.71. The impairment analysis that we performed during the fourth quarter of 2009 resulted in no impairment of the Companys goodwill and no additional impairment for the Companys other indefinite lived intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2009. Along with the normal impairment analysis, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis on the projected results, the goodwill and the other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis assuming revenue for each individual reporting unit for goodwill and each individual indefinite lived intangible asset decreased an additional 20% from the current projections for 2010, 2011 and 2012, while holding all other factors constant and no impairment was identified. Additionally, if the Company were to increase its discount rate 100 basis points, while keeping all other assumptions constant, there would be no impairments in any of the goodwill associated with the Companys reporting units or any of the Companys indefinite lived intangible assets. While the Company does not believe that these events (20% drop in additional revenue for the next three years or 100 basis point increases in weighted average costs of capital) or changes are likely to occur, it is reasonably possible these events could transpire if market conditions worsen and if the market fails to continue to recover in 2010 and or 2011. Any significant changes to these assumptions and factors could have a material impact on the Companys goodwill impairment analysis. Inherent in our projections are key assumptions relative to how long the current downward cycle might last. Service and Product Warranties The Company provides service and warranty policies on certain of its products. The Company accrues liabilities under service and warranty policies based upon specific claims and a review of historical warranty and service claim experience in accordance with ASC Topic 450 Contingencies (ASC Topic 450). Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience change. In addition, the Company incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues and accrues for them when they are encountered. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, service and product warranties totaled $217 million and $114 million, respectively. 47 Table of Contents Income Taxes The Company is a U.S. registered company and is subject to income taxes in the U.S. The Company operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. Income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates of the countries in which the Company operates and income is earned. The Companys annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income, statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The determination and evaluation of the annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. It requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of income, deductions and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or the Companys level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could impact the tax liability in any given year. The Company also operates in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the pricing of transactions between related parties are open to interpretation, which could potentially result in aggressive tax authorities asserting additional tax liabilities with no offsetting tax recovery in other countries. The Company maintains liabilities for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation. The annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that the Company considers appropriate, as well as related interest. Tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing and certain operating expenses that may not be deductible in foreign jurisdictions. These exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means. The Company is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions which may result in proposed assessments. The Company believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures under the guidance in ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes (ASC Topic 740). However, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The Company reviews these liabilities quarterly and to the extent audits or other events result in an adjustment to the liability accrued for a prior year, the effect will be recognized in the period of the event. The Company currently has recorded valuation allowances that the Company intends to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in the Companys valuation allowances. The realization of remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that the Company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings. The Company has not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested. Should the Company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries, the Company may be required to record additional taxes. Unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries were $2,764 million and $2,255 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company makes an annual determination whether to permanently reinvest these earnings. If, as a result of these reassessments, the Company distributes these earnings in the future, additional tax liability would result, offset by any available foreign tax credits. The Company does not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability, if any, is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated. These include, among others, the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities; the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process; the impartiality of the local courts; and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce, or fail to produce, an offsetting tax change in other countries. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In April 2009 the FASB issued ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC Topic 805). ASC Topic 805 amends the provisions for the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosures for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations. ASC Topic 805 is effective for contingent assets and contingent liabilities acquired in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company expects ASC Topic 805 will have a future impact on its consolidated financial statements, but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature, term and size of the acquired contingencies. In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments (ASC Topic 825). ASC Topic 825 extends the annual disclosure requirements regarding the fair value of financial instruments to interim financial statements of publicly traded companies. ASC Topic 825 is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. On June 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 825. There was no significant impact to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements from the adoption of ASC Topic 825. 48 Table of Contents In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events (ASC Topic 855). ASC Topic 855 requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. ASC Topic 855 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ending after June 15, 2009. On June 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 855. There was no significant impact to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements from the adoption of ASC Topic 855. In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (ASC Topic 105). The ASC is now the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. On the effective date, ASC Topic 105 superseded all then existing non SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other non grandfathered non SEC accounting literature not included in the ASC has become non authoritative. ASC Topic 105 became effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. Forward Looking Statements Some of the information in this document contains, or has incorporated by reference, forward looking statements. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements typically are identified by use of terms such as may, will, expect, anticipate, estimate, and similar words, although some forward looking statements are expressed differently. All statements herein regarding expected merger synergies are forward looking statements. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from results anticipated in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in oil and gas prices, customer demand for our products and worldwide economic activity. You should also consider carefully the statements under Risk Factors which address additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward looking statements. Given these uncertainties, current or prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any such factors or forward looking statements to reflect future events or developments. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Additional information concerning each of these matters follows: Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We have extensive operations in foreign countries. The net assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, although such fluctuations generally do not affect income since their functional currency is typically the local currency. These operations also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency, which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company reported foreign currency gains (losses) of ($79) million, $50 million, and ($7) million, respectively. The gains and losses are primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and in 2009 adjustments to our hedged positions as a result of the current economic environment. Strengthening of currencies against the U.S. dollar may create losses in future periods to the extent we maintain net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the countries using the local currency as their functional currency. Some of our revenues in foreign countries are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those U.S. dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency. Similarly some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, but have associated U.S. dollar costs, which also give rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure. In order to mitigate that risk, we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.

These market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances and overdraft facilities. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on these financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect net income by $5 million. 51 Table of Contents The counterparties to forward contracts are major financial institutions. The credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis. In the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract, our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential. We assess the functional currencies of our operating units to ensure that the appropriate currencies are utilized in accordance with the guidance of ASC Topic 830 Foreign Currency Matters. Effective January 1, 2008, we changed the functional currency of our Rig Technology unit in Norway from the Norwegian krone to the U.S. dollar to more appropriately reflect the primary economic environment in which they operate. This change was precipitated by significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances, including: the increased order rate for large drilling platforms and components technology, the use of our Norway unit as our preferred project manager of these projects, increasing revenue and cost base in U.S. dollars, and the implementation of an international cash pool denominated in U.S. dollars. As a Norwegian krone functional unit, Norway was subject to increasing foreign currency exchange risk as a result of these changes in its economic environment and was dependent upon significant hedging transactions to offset its non functional currency positions. At December 31, 2007, our Norway operations had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating $2,551 million with a fair value of $91 million to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk against the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency. Effective with the change in the functional currency, the Company terminated these hedges. The related net gain position of $109 million associated with the terminated hedges has been deferred and is being recognized into earnings in the future period(s) the forecasted transactions affect earnings, of which $10 million remains to be recognized into future earnings at December 31, 2009. The Company has subsequent to January 1, 2008, entered into new hedges to cover the exposures as a result of the changes to U.S. dollar functional. At December 31, 2009, our Norway operations had derivatives with $2,024 million in notional value with a fair value of $58 million, included in the table above. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2009 our long term borrowings consisted of $150 million in 6.5% Senior Notes, $200 million in 7.25% Senior Notes, $200 million in 5.65% Senior Notes, $150 million in 5.5% Senior Notes and $151 million in 6.125% Senior Notes. We occasionally have borrowings under our credit facility, and a portion of these borrowings could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market risk with exchange rate movements. These instruments carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from LIBOR, NIBOR or EURIBOR, or at the prime interest rate. Under our credit facility, we may, at our option, fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over LIBOR, NIBOR or EURIBOR for 30 days to 6 months.
