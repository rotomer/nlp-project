ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 EARNINGS PER SHARE Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for 2001 were $1.35, compared to $1.10 for 2000, an increase of $0.25 or approximately 22.7%. During the year 2001, earnings per share were adversely affected through additional dilution resulting from the issuance of 18.4 million shares of common stock in March 2001 and through the issuance and exercise of stock options throughout the year, as compared to 2000. NET INCOME Net income for 2001 was $265.2 million, compared to $182.9 million for 2000, an increase of $82.3 million or approximately 45.0%. Net income for 2001 increased by $82.3 million due to the factors described below. REVENUES AND EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES For the year ended December 31, 2001, NRG Energy had total revenues and equity earnings of $3.0 billion, compared to $2.2 billion for 2000, an increase of $850.7 million or approximately 39.4%. REVENUES FROM MAJORITY OWNED OPERATIONS NRG Energys operating revenues from majority owned operations were $2.8 billion compared to $2.0 billion, an increase of $780 million or approximately 38.6%. Revenues from majority owned operations for the year ended December 31, 2001, consisted primarily of power generation revenues from domestic operations of approximately $1.8 billion, operations in Europe of $490.9 million, Asia Pacific $239.1 million and Other Americas $34.7 million, resulting in increases of $256.5 million, $293.2 million, $144.4 million and $34.4 million compared to 2000, respectively. In addition, NRG Energy recognized revenues from majority owned operations from its alternative energy, thermal and other operations of approximately $79.5 million, $108.3 million and $10.9 million respectively, resulting in increases of $37.9 million, $20.5 million and a decrease of $6.9 million compared to 2000, respectively. The increase of $256.5 million related to NRG Energys domestic power generation operations is due primarily to additional sales at NRG Energys Mid Atlantic region facilities which were acquired in June 2001 from Conectiv and increased sales at NRG Energys South Central region facilities which were primarily acquired in March 2000 from Cajun Electric and expanded with the acquisition of the Batesville facility from LS Power in January 2001 and completion of the Sterlington and Big Cajun 1 peaking facilities in 2001. The increase of $293.2 million related to NRG Energys Europe power generation operations is due primarily to operations at Entrade, the Csepel facility in Hungary and Saale Energia in Germany (SEG). Entrade was acquired in November 2000, Csepel was acquired in June 2001 and SEG through an increase in ownership became consolidated in March 2001. The increase of $144.4 million related to NRG Energys Asia Pacifics power generation operations is due primarily to a full year of operations at the Flinders Power facilities which was acquired in August 2000 and to a lesser degree the addition of the Hsin Yu Development Company facilities in July 2001. The increase of $34.4 million related to NRG Energys Other Americas power generation operations is due primarily to the consolidation in 2001 of the COBEE and Bulo Bulo facilities which were previously accounted for under the equity method. EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES For the year ended December 31, 2001, NRG Energy had equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $210.0 million, compared to $139.4 million for 2000, an increase of $70.6 million or approximately 50.7%. The increase of $70.6 million is primarily comprised of favorable results from NRG Energys domestic and 30 international power generation equity investments. During 2001, NRG Energys domestic power generation investment in West Coast Power contributed $41.0 million of this increase. NRG Energys international power generation investments in MIBRAG, Loy Yang and Kladno (ECKG) also favorably contributed to equity in earnings for 2001 in comparison to 2000. MIBRAG favorably contributed $13.3 million, Loy Yang favorably contributed $11.7 million due to improved market prices in Australia, Kladno contributed $6.6 million, Enfield contributed $7.4 million and Kondapalli contributed $3.8 million. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable results at NRG Energys other investments accounted for under the equity method and continued reductions in the equity earnings attributable to NEO Corporation. NEO Corporation derives a significant portion of its net income from Section 29 tax credits. OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES For the year ended December 31, 2001, cost of majority owned operations was $1.9 billion compared to $1.3 billion for 2000, an increase of $566.2 million or approximately 43.9%. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, cost of majority owned operations represented approximately 66.3% and 63.9% of revenues from majority owned operations, respectively. Cost of majority owned operations consists primarily of cost of energy (primarily fuel costs), labor, operating and maintenance costs and non income based taxes related to NRG Energys majority owned operations. Approximately 89% of the increase in operating costs and expenses for 2001 compared to 2000 of $566.2 million is primarily due to increased cost of energy incurred at NRG Energys generating facilities. The majority of the growth in cost of majority owned operations was due to NRG Energys recent international acquisitions. In the third and fourth quarters of 2000, NRG Energy completed the Flinders and Entrade acquisitions, during the second quarter of 2001, NRG Energy increased its ownership in the Schkopau, Cobee and Bulo Bulo projects as well as acquired the Csepel facility in Hungary. During the third quarter NRG Energy acquired a 60% interest in the Hsin Yu Energy Development Company. These recent acquisitions accounted for approximately $370.7 million of the increase in the cost of majority owned operations the remaining increase is due primarily to increased operating costs at the South Central region generating facilities, the recently acquired Mid Atlantic generating facilities and costs incurred by NRG Energys power marketing operations. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION For the year ended December 31, 2001, depreciation and amortization was $212.5 million, compared to $122.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $89.5 million or approximately 72.8%. This increase is primarily due to the addition of property, plant and equipment related to NRG Energys recently completed acquisitions of electric generating facilities. Approximately $57.2 million of this increase is related to increased depreciable balances resulting from recently completed domestic acquisitions and the remainder is related to recently completed international acquisitions. Through primarily acquisitions NRG Energys net property, plant and equipment balance has grown to $9.4 billion, at the end of 2001 from $4.0 billion, at the end of 2000, an increase of $5.4 billion, or approximately 133.4%. GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND DEVELOPMENT For the year ended December 31, 2001, general, administrative and development costs were $225.7 million, compared to $172.5 million, an increase of $53.2 million or approximately 30.8%. This increase is primarily due to increased business development activities, associated legal, technical and accounting expenses, employees and equipment resulting from expanded operations and pending acquisitions. This also includes a $10.3 million expense related to Enrons bankruptcy. This amount includes a pre tax charge of $22.4 million to establish bad debt reserves, which was partially offset by a pre tax gain of $12.1 million on a credit swap agreement entered into as part of the NRG Energys credit risk management program. 31 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) For the year ended December 31, 2001, total other expense was $416.2 million, compared to $297.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $118.8 million or approximately 40.0%. The increase in total other expense of $118.8 million, from 2000, consisted primarily of an increase in interest expense that was partially offset by an increase in other income and a reduction in minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2001, interest expense (which includes both corporate and project level interest expense) was $443.7 million, compared to $293.9 million in 2000, an increase of $149.8 million or approximately 51.0%. This increase is due to increased corporate and project level debt issued during 2001. During 2001, NRG Energy issued substantial amounts of long term debt at both the corporate level (recourse debt) and project level (non recourse debt) to either directly finance the acquisition of electric generating facilities or refinance short term bridge loans incurred to finance such acquisitions. NRG Energy also completed its issuance of a $2 billion construction revolver during 2001 of which approximately $697.5 million is outstanding as of December 31, 2001. NRG Energys outstanding debt balances has grown to $9.2 billion at the end of 2001 from $3.8 billion at the end of 2000. The growth in the outstanding debt balance has contributed directly to the growth in interest expense during 2001, as compared to 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2001, minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries was $6.6 million, compared to $11.3 million, a decrease of $4.7 million or approximately 42.1%, as compared to 2000. The decrease is primarily due to lower earnings from the Crockett Cogeneration project which resulted from bad debt reserves established in 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2001, other income, net, was $34.1 million, as compared to $7.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $26.2 million, or approximately 333.8%. Other income, net consists primarily of interest income on cash balances and loans to affiliates, and miscellaneous other items, including the income statement impact of certain foreign currency translation adjustments and the impact of gains and losses on the dispositions of investments. Approximately $18.0 million of the increase relates to interest on cash balances and loans to affiliates, primarily West Coast Power. The increase also includes gains on foreign currency translation adjustments and miscellaneous asset sales that were partially offset by a $3.8 million charge to write off capitalized costs associated with the Estonia project. INCOME TAX For the year ended December 31, 2001, income tax expense was $33.4 million, compared to an income tax expense of $92.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of $59.3 million, or approximately 64.0%. Approximately $14.7 million of the decrease is attributed to additional IRC Section 29 energy credits that were recorded in 2001, as compared to the same period in 2000. NRG Energy reported a worldwide effective tax rate of approximately 27.5% (before tax credits) for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to approximately 46.0% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The overall reduction in tax rates was primarily due to the implementation of state tax planning strategies and a higher percentage of NRGs overall earnings derived from foreign projects in lower tax jurisdictions. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 For the year ended December 31, 2000, net income was $182.9 million compared to $57.2 million for 1999, an increase of $125.7 million or 219.8%. This increase was due to the factors described below. REVENUES AND EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES For the year ended December 31, 2000, NRG Energy had total revenues and equity earnings of $2.2 billion, compared to $500.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $1.7 billion or approximately 331.6%. NRG Energys operating revenues from majority owned operations were $2.0 billion compared to $432.5 million, an increase of $1.6 billion or approximately 366.7%. The increase in revenues from majority owned operations is primarily due to increased sales resulting from recently completed acquisitions of electric generating facilities, primarily during the later portion of 1999 and the first and third 32 quarters of 2000. During the later portion of 1999, NRG Energy acquired certain electric generating facilities in the northeastern region of the United States. In addition, NRG Energy acquired certain electric generating facilities located in Louisiana and the United Kingdom at the end of the first quarter of 2000. During the third quarter of 2000, NRG Energy acquired Flinders Power and certain thermal operations. In addition, NRG Energys increased ownership in Crockett Cogeneration has contributed significantly to its revenue growth during 2000, as compared to 1999. For the year ended December 31, 2000, NRG Energy had equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $139.4 million, compared to $67.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $71.9 million or 106.5%. The increase in equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is due primarily to NRG Energys investment in West Coast Power LLC, which benefited from favorable market conditions in California. In addition, NRG Energys investment in Rocky Road LLC, in the fourth quarter of 1999, also contributed favorably to the increase in equity earnings, compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by reductions in the earnings attributable to NRG Energys international equity investments and its investment in NEO Corporation. NEO Corporation derives a significant portion of its net income from Section 29 tax credits. OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES For the year ended December 31, 2000, cost of majority owned operations, was $1.3 billion, compared to $269.9 million, an increase of $1.0 billion or approximately 377.8%. For the year ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, cost of majority owned operations represented approximately 59.8% and 54.0% of total operating revenues and equity earnings, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the increase of $1.0 billion is primarily due to NRG Energys recent acquisitions of electric generating facilities during the later portion of 1999 and primarily the first and third quarters of 2000. During the later portion of 1999, NRG Energy acquired certain electric generating facilities in the northeastern region of the United States. In addition, NRG Energy acquired certain electric generating facilities located in Louisiana and the United Kingdom at the end of the first quarter of 2000. During the third quarter of 2000, NRG Energy acquired Flinders Power and certain thermal operations. In addition, NRG Energys ownership in Crockett Cogeneration has contributed significantly to the growth the cost of majority owned operations during 2000, as compared to 1999. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION For the year ended December 31, 2000, depreciation and amortization was $122.9 million, compared to $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $85.9 million or 232.1%. This increase is primarily due to the addition of property, plant and equipment related to NRG Energys recently completed acquisitions of electric generating facilities during the later portion of 1999 and primarily the first and third quarters of 2000. In addition the consolidation of NRG Energys investment in Crockett Cogeneration at the end of 1999 also contributed to the increase in depreciation and amortization during 2000. Through these acquisitions NRG Energys net property, plant and equipment balance has grown to $4.0 billion at the end of 2000 from $2.0 billion at the end of 1999, an increase of $2.0 billion or approximately 104.6%. GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND DEVELOPMENT For the year ended December 31, 2000, general, administrative and development costs were $172.5 million, compared to $83.6 million, an increase of $88.9 million or approximately 106.4%. This increase is primarily due to increased business development activities, associated legal, technical and accounting expenses, employees and equipment resulting from expanded operations and pending acquisitions. NRG Energys asset base has grown to $6.0 billion at the end of 2000, compared to $3.4 billion at the end of 1999, an increase of $2.5 billion or approximately 74.2%. NRG Energy expects this trend to continue as it continues to be successful in expanding its operations through closure of its pending acquisitions and business development activities. 33 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) For the year ended December 31, 2000, total other expense was $297.4 million, compared to $78.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $219.0 million or approximately 279.3%. The increase in total other expense of $219.0 million, as compared to 1999, consisted primarily of an increase in Interest expense and Minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiary. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other income, net and gain on sale of interest in projects, in comparison to 1999. For the year ended December 31, 2000, interest expense (which includes both corporate and project level interest expense) was $293.9 million, as compared to $93.4 million in 1999, an increase of $200.5 million or approximately 214.8%. This increase is due to increased corporate and project level debt issued during 2000 as compared to 1999. During 2000, NRG Energy issued substantial amounts of long term debt at both the corporate level (recourse debt) and project level (non recourse debt) to either directly finance the acquisition of electric generating facilities or refinance short term bridge loans incurred to finance such acquisitions. NRG Energys outstanding long term debt balances have grown to $3.8 billion at the end of 2000 from $2.0 billion at the end of 1999. The growth of such outstanding debt balances has contributed directly to the growth in interest expense during 2000 as compared to 1999. For the year ended December 31, 2000, minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries was $11.3 million, compared to $2.5 million, an increase of $8.8 million or approximately 361.5% as compared to 1999. The increase is due to the consolidation of NRG Energys 58% interest in Crockett Cogeneration at the end of 1999 and the recognition of the minority interest in the project. For the year ended December 31, 2000, NRG Energy did not recognize any gains on the sale of any project interests. During 1999 NRG Energy recognized a gain of $11.0 million related to the reduction in its ownership of Cogeneration Corporation of America (CogenAmerica). For the year ended December 31, 2000, other income, net, was $7.9 million, as compared to $6.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 1999, an increase of $1.5 million, or approximately 22.2%. Other income, net consists primarily of interest income on loans to affiliates, and miscellaneous other items, including the income statement impact of certain foreign currency translation adjustments and the impact of project write downs and gains and losses on the dispositions of investments. The increase of $1.5 million is primarily due to an increase in interest income in 2000. INCOME TAX For the year ended December 31, 2000, income tax expense was $92.7 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $26.1 million, an increase of $118.8 million or approximately 455.6%, compared to 1999. The increase in tax expense in 2000 compared to 1999 is due primarily to higher domestic taxable income. This increase was partially offset by additional IRC Section 29 energy credits. For the year ended December 31, 2000, NRG Energys overall effective income tax rate was approximately 34%. NRG Energys effective income tax rate before recognition of tax credits is 46%. This rate is higher than a combined federal and Minnesota statutory rate because a significant portion of NRG Energys income is generated in New York City, an area with high state and local tax rates. In addition, NRG Energy has recorded a valuation allowance on certain state and foreign tax losses, also increasing the effective tax rate. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES NRG Energys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon NRG Energys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying 34 assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed. On an ongoing basis, NRG Energy, evaluates its estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods NRG Energy considers reasonable in particular circumstances. In any case, actual results may differ significantly from NRG Energys estimates. Any effects on NRG Energys business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. NRG Energys significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 8 Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table identifies certain of the significant accounting policies listed in Item 8 Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table also identifies the judgments required and uncertainties involved in the application of each. These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by NRG Energys management in their application, have a significant impact on NRG Energys consolidated financial statements. NRG Energy identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of NRG Energys financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. ACCOUNTING POLICY JUDGMENTS/UNCERTAINTIES AFFECTING APPLICATION Consolidation Policy Determination of control of investments with less than or equal to 50% interest Consistent application of accounting policies of partnerships and joint ventures Capitalization Practices Determination of beginning and ending of capitalization periods Asset Valuation/Purchase Recoverability of investment through future operations Accounting Regulatory and political environments and requirements Estimated useful lives of assets Allocation of purchase prices to identified assets Revenue Recognition Customer/counter party dispute resolution practices Market maturity and economic conditions Contract interpretation Uncollectible Receivables Economic conditions affecting customers, counter parties, suppliers and market prices Regulatory environment and impact on customer financial condition Outcome of litigation and bankruptcy proceedings Derivative Financial Instruments Market conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commitments Assumptions used in valuation models Counter party credit risk Market conditions in foreign countries Regulatory and political environments and requirements Environmental Issues Government regulations and standards Results of ongoing research and development regarding environmental impacts Cost of remediation Benefit Plan Accounting Future rate of return on pension and other plan assets Interest rates used in valuing benefit obligation 35 ACCOUNTING POLICY JUDGMENTS/UNCERTAINTIES AFFECTING APPLICATION Income Tax Reserves Application of tax statues and regulations to transactions Anticipated future decisions of tax authorities Ability of tax authority decisions/positions to withstand legal challenges and appeals Ability to utilize tax benefits through future earnings Of all of the accounting policies identified in the above table, NRG Energy believes that the following policies and the application thereof to be those having the most direct impact on NRG Energys financial position and results of operations. CONSOLIDATION POLICY NRG Energys consolidated financial statements include NRG Energys accounts and those of its subsidiaries. The accounting policies for all of NRG Energys operations are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. NRG Energy has investments in partnerships, joint ventures and projects, investments such as these in which NRG Energy does not have control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method. CAPITALIZATION PRACTICES, ASSET VALUATION AND PURCHASE ACCOUNTING As of December 31, 2001, NRG Energy has a carrying value of approximately $9.4 billion of net property, plant and equipment, $2.9 billion of which is under construction, representing approximately 73.1% and 22.8% of total assets, respectively. The majority of the carrying value of property, plant and equipment is the result of NRG Energys recent asset acquisitions. These amounts represent the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. These estimates may be adjusted based upon completion of certain procedures including third party valuations. For those assets that were or are being constructed by NRG Energy the carrying value reflects the application of NRG Energys property, plant and equipment policies which incorporate estimates, assumptions and judgments by management relative to the capitalized costs and useful lives of NRG Energys generating facilities. NRG Energy periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired. Asset impairment evaluations are, by nature highly subjective. REVENUE RECOGNITION AND UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES NRG Energy is primarily an electric generation company, operating a portfolio of majority owned electric generating plants and certain plants in which its ownership is 50% or less which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. NRG Energy also produces thermal energy for sale to customers and collects methane gas from landfill sites, which is then used for the generation of electricity. Both physical and financial transactions are entered into to optimize the financial performance of NRG Energys generating facilities. Electric energy is recognized upon transmission to the customer. Capacity and ancillary revenue is recognized when contractually earned. Revenues from operations and maintenance services, is recognized when the services are performed. NRG Energy uses the equity method of accounting to recognize its pro rata share of the net income or loss of its unconsolidated investments. NRG Energy continually assesses the collectibility of its receivables and in the event it believes a receivable to be uncollectible an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded or in the event of a contractual dispute the receivable and corresponding revenue may be considered unlikely of recovery and not recorded in the financial statements until management is satisfied that it will be collected. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In January 2001, NRG Energy adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138. SFAS No. 133 requires NRG Energy to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of non hedge derivatives 36 are immediately recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as offset to the charges in the fair value of the related hedged assets, liabilities and firm commitments or for forecasted transactions, deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings. NRG Energy primarily applies SFAS No. 133 to long term power sales contracts, long term gas purchase contracts and other energy related commodities financial instruments used to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices, hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities and protect investments in fuel inventories. SFAS No. 133 also applies to interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange rate contracts. The application of SFAS No. 133 results in increased volatility in earnings due to the impact market prices have on the market positions and financial instruments that NRG Energy has entered into. In determining the fair value of these derivative/financial instruments NRG Energy uses estimates, various assumptions, judgement of management and when considered appropriate third party experts in determining the fair value of these derivatives. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historically, NRG Energy and its subsidiaries have obtained cash from operations, issuance of debt and equity securities, borrowings under credit facilities, capital contributions from Xcel Energy, reimbursement by Xcel Energy of tax benefits pursuant to a tax sharing agreement and proceeds from non recourse project financings. NRG Energy has used these funds to finance operations, service debt obligations, fund the acquisition, development and construction of generation facilities, finance capital expenditures and meet other cash and liquidity needs. NRG Energy targets a financial strategy that sustains investment grade ratings and diversifies investment risk. Specifically, NRG Energy seeks to fund an average of 50% of its project investments with non recourse project level debt, 20% with senior unsecured recourse debt, and 30% with equity and internal cash generation. The proportion of project financing varies depending on the dispatch and the quantity of revenues under contract so that base load or highly contracted plants will typically support greater than 50% non recourse debt; whereas merchant or peaking assets will support less than 50% financing. When taken in total NRG Energy has and will continue to arrange 50% of its financing with non recourse project level debt. Substantially all of NRG Energys operations are conducted by project subsidiaries and project affiliates. NRG Energys cash flow and ability to service corporate level indebtedness when due is dependent upon receipt of cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from NRG Energys projects and other subsidiaries. The debt agreements of NRG Energys subsidiaries and project affiliates generally restrict their ability to pay dividends, make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to NRG Energy. As of December 31, 2001, six of NRG Energys subsidiaries and project affiliates are restricted from making cash payments to NRG Energy. Loy Yang, Killingholme, Energy Center Kladno and Louisiana Generating do not currently meet the minimum debt service coverage ratios required for these projects to make payments to NRG Energy; Batesville is resolving equipment problems that will cause its debt service coverage ratio to fall below the minimum required for distribution, though, irrespective of the debt service coverage ratio, no distributions to NRG Energy were anticipated from Batesville in 2002; and Crockett Cogeneration is limited in its ability to make distributions to NRG Energy and the other partners. NRG Energy believes that the situations at Louisiana Generating, Energy Center Kladno, Batesville and Killingholme do not create an event of default and will not allow the lenders to accelerate the project financings. The forced outage of one 500 MW unit at Loy Yang combined with current market prices may lead to an event of default and the possible acceleration of the Loy Yang project debt in the fourth quarter of 2002, but if insurance claims are paid and budgeted revenues and costs are achieved, along with replacement of the damaged unit as scheduled, default will be avoided. Loy Yang then has an AUD $500 million repayment due in May 2003 that will need to be refinanced prior to maturity. The bankruptcy of PG&E creates the potential for a covenant default that would result in the acceleration of the debt at Crockett if not resolved with the lenders. Management has engaged in active discussions with the lenders to Crockett since PG&E filed for bankruptcy in April 2001, and Crockett is being paid each month 37 by PG&E since the bankruptcy filing. Thus NRG Energy believes that an acceleration of the Crockett debt is unlikely. The U.S. Federal Bankruptcy Court recently approved the power purchase agreement thereby increasing the likelihood that Crockett soon will be permitted by the lenders to distribute any excess cash flows to the partners. In all of these cases NRG Energys corporate level financial obligations to project lenders is limited to no more than six months debt service. CASH FLOWS 2001 2000 1999 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (in thousands)............................................... $276,014 $361,678 ($11,380) Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2001 compared with 2000, primarily due to adverse changes to working capital and increased undistributed equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. These decreases to net cash were partially offset by increases in net income after non cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization in 2001 as compared to 2000. The adverse changes to working capital are primarily due to increases in inventory balances, accrued income taxes receivables and changes in other long term assets and liabilities, partially offset by a favorable change in other current liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased during 2000 compared with 1999, primarily due to increased earnings during the year, increased depreciation and amortization and deferred income tax and investment tax credits, non cash reductions in earnings and improved working capital. 2001 2000 1999 Net cash used in investing activities (in thousands)........................................ ($4,335,641) ($2,204,148) ($1,668,613) Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2001, compared with 2000, primarily due to additional acquisitions of electric generating facilities and increased capital expenditures and project investments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2000, compared with 1999, primarily due to acquisitions of electric generating facilities and increased capital expenditures and project investments. 2001 2000 1999 Net cash provided by financing activities (in thousands)........................................... $4,153,546 $1,905,870 $1,705,095 Net cash provided by financing activities during 2001 increased, compared to 2000 due to the issuance of debt and equity securities to finance asset acquisitions. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2000 increased, compared to 1999, primarily due to the issuance of debt and equity securities to finance asset acquisitions. PROSPECTIVE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS In 2002, NRG Energy expects to complete the acquisition from FirstEnergy, for approximately $1.6 billion in cash and assumed debt, of a portfolio of assets. The FirstEnergy acquisition is expected to be financed with an $875 million lease with limited recourse to NRG Energy, the assumption of $145 million of municipal debt secured by the Bay Shore facility, and $575 million of capital raised directly by NRG Energy through internal cash flow and the sale of existing assets. CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS As of December 31, 2001, NRG Energy estimates its capital expenditure program to be approximately $7.5 billion for the period 2002 2006. NRG Energy expects to spend approximately $1.9 billion in 2002, $1.8 billion in 2003 and $1.6 billion in 2004. These estimated expenditures are primarily for NRG Energys project development program. For 2002, NRG Energys capital requirements reflect the expected construction costs for those projects currently under construction and those expected to begin construction in the near future. In January 2002, NRG Energy announced that it planned to scale back its previously announced acquisition and construction plans in order to enhance its financial position and improve liquidity in 2002. The 38 above amounts reflect this previously announced scaled back construction schedule. In March 2002, Xcel Energy commenced an exchange offer by which Xcel Energy would acquire all of the outstanding publicly held shares of NRG Energy. If successful, Xcel Energy has stated that it intends to delay or cancel $1.6 billion of planned projects, among other actions. The proposed delays or cancellations have not been factored into the above expected capital expenditures. NRG Energys capital expenditure program is subject to continuing review and modification. Actual expenditures may differ significantly depending upon such factors as the success, timing of and the level of involvement in projects under consideration. ACQUISITION AND CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM CAPITAL SOURCES NRG Energy has generally financed the acquisition and development of its projects under financing arrangements to be repaid solely from each of its projects cash flows, which are typically secured by the plants physical assets and equity interests in the project company. Financing needs are subject to continuing review and can change depending on market and business conditions and changes, if any, in the capital requirements of NRG Energy and its subsidiaries. During the year ended December 31, 2001, NRG Energy financed its acquisition program and construction activities through a combination of the following corporate level and project level financings and operating cash flows. The specifics of such financing arrangements are detailed below: As of December 31, 2001, NRG Energy had a $500 million recourse revolving credit facility under a commitment fee arrangement that matures in March of 2002. This facility provided short term financing in the form of bank loans. At December 31, 2001, NRG Energy had $170 million outstanding under this facility. In March 2002, the revolving credit facility terminated and was replaced with a $1.0 billion 364 day corporate level unsecured revolving line of credit with ABN AMRO Bank, N.V. as Administrative Agent. NRG Energys $1.0 billion 364 day revolving line of credit terminates on March 7, 2003. The facility is unsecured and provides for borrowings of "Base Rate Loans" and "Eurocurrency Loans". The Base Rate Loans bear interest at the greater of the Administrative Agents prime rate or the sum of the prevailing per annum rates for overnight funds plus 0.5% per annum, plus an additional margin which varies based upon NRG Energys utilization of the facility and its then current senior debt credit rating. The Eurocurrency loans bear interest at an adjusted rate based on LIBOR plus an adjustment percentage which varies depending on NRG Energys senior debt credit rating and the amount outstanding under the facility. The facility contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the incurrence of liens and require NRG Energy to maintain a net worth of at least $500 million plus 25% of NRG Energys consolidated net income from January 1, 2002 through the determination date. In addition, NRG Energy must maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 0.68 to 1.00, and must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1.00, as determined at the end of each fiscal quarter. The failure to comply with any of these covenants would be an Event of Default under the terms of the credit agreement. In May 2001, NRG Energys wholly owned subsidiary, NRG Finance Company I LLC, entered into a $2 billion revolving credit facility. The facility has been and will be used to finance the acquisition, development and construction of power generating plants located in the United States and to finance the acquisition of turbines for such facilities. The facility provides for borrowings of base rate loans and Eurocurrency loans and is secured by mortgages and security agreements in respect of the assets of the projects financed under the facility, pledges of the equity interests in the subsidiaries or affiliates of the borrower that own such projects, and by guaranties from each such subsidiary or affiliate. Provided that certain conditions are met that assure the lenders that sufficient security remains for the remaining outstanding loans, the borrower may repay loans relating to one project and have the liens relating to that project released. Loans that have been repaid may be re borrowed, as permitted by the terms of the facility. The facility terminates on May 8, 2006. The facility is non recourse to NRG Energy other than its obligation to contribute equity at certain times in respect of projects and turbines financed under the facility. As of December 31, 2001, the aggregate amount outstanding under this facility was $697.5 million. 39 In January 2001, NRG Energy entered into a bridge credit agreement, with a final maturity date of December 31, 2001. Approximately $600 million was borrowed under this facility to partially finance NRG Energys acquisition of the LS Power generation assets. During March of 2001, NRG Energy raised net proceeds of approximately $473.4 million through a second common stock offering of 18.4 million shares of common stock. In addition, approximately $278.4 million of net proceeds were raised through the issuance of 11.5 million equity units. Each equity unit initially comprises a $25 principal amount of NRG Energys senior debentures and an obligation to acquire shares of NRG Energys common stock no later then May 18, 2004. A portion of the combined net proceeds were used to repay a $600 million bridge credit agreement entered into in January 2001 to acquire certain generating facilities and projects from LS Power; the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. In April 2001, NRG Energy issued $690 million of senior notes in two tranches. The first tranche of $350 million matures in April 2011 and bears an interest rate of 7.75%. The second tranche of $340 million matures in April 2031 and bears an interest rate of 8.625%. The net proceeds of the issuance were used for repayment of short term indebtedness incurred to fund acquisitions, for investments, general corporate purposes and to provide capital for future planned acquisitions. In June 2001, NRG Energy entered into a $600 million term loan facility. The facility was unsecured and provided for borrowings of base rate loans and Eurocurrency loans. The facility had a termination date of June 21, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, the aggregate amount outstanding under this facility was $600 million. NRG Energy repaid this facility in March 2002 in conjunction with the closing of its new $1.0 billion unsecured corporate level revolving line of credit and the receipt of $300 million of cash from Xcel Energy. On June 22, 2001, NRG Mid Atlantic Generating LLC (Mid Atlantic), a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG Energy, borrowed approximately $420.9 million under a five year term loan agreement (Agreement) to finance, in part, the acquisition of certain generating facilities from Conectiv. The Agreement terminates in November 2005 and provides for a total credit facility of $580 million. In June 2001, NRG Energy through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Brazos Valley Energy LP and Brazos Valley Technology LP, entered into a $180 million non recourse construction credit facility to fund the construction of the 600 MW Brazos Valley gas fired combined cycle merchant generation facility located in Fort Bend County, Texas. As of December 31, 2001, there exists an outstanding balance of $159.8 million under this credit agreement. In connection with NRG Energys acquisition of the Audrain facilities, NRG Energy has recognized a capital lease on its balance sheet in the amount of $239.9 million, as of December 31, 2001. The capital lease obligation is recorded at the net present value of the minimum lease obligation payable. The lease terminates in May 2023. In addition, approximately $326 million was drawn down on NRG Energys construction revolver to refinance NRG Energys investment in the Audrain County Municipal bonds originally issued to finance the construction of the Audrain generating facility. In July 2001, NRG Energy completed the sale of $500 million of unsecured senior notes. The senior notes were issued in two tranches, the first tranche of $340 million of 6.75% Senior Notes is due July 2006 and the second tranche of $160 million of 8.625% Senior Notes is due April 2031. NRG Energy received net proceeds from the sale of both series of notes of approximately $505.2 million, including interest on the senior notes due 2031, accrued from April 5, 2001. The net proceeds were used to repay all amounts outstanding under NRG Energys revolving credit agreement and for investments, other general corporate purposes and to provide capital for planned acquisitions. In August 2001, NRG Energy entered into a 364 day term loan of up to $296 million. The credit facility was structured as a senior unsecured loan and was partially non recourse to NRG Energy. The proceeds were used to finance the McClain generating facility acquisition. In November 2001 the credit facility was repaid from the proceeds of a $181.0 million term loan and $8.0 million working capital facility entered into by NRG McClain LLC, with Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, New York branch, as agent (Non recourse to 40 NRG Energy). The final maturity date of the facility is November 30, 2006. As of December 31, 2001, the aggregate amount outstanding under this facility was $159.9 million. REGISTRATION STATEMENTS In December 2000, NRG Energy filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC. Based on this registration, NRG Energy could issue up to $1.65 billion of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants and convertible securities. This registration statement included $150 million of securities that were carried forward from a previous shelf registration. During March 2001, NRG Energy issued 18.4 million shares of common stock and 11.5 million corporate units under this shelf registration. There are no remaining amounts available under this shelf registration as of December 31, 2001. In June 2001, NRG Energy filed a shelf registration with the SEC to sell up to $2 billion in debt securities, common and preferred stock, warrants and other securities. NRG Energy expects to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing and development of new facilities, working capital and debt reduction. In July 2001, NRG Energy completed the sale of $500 million of unsecured senior notes under this shelf registration, approximately $1.5 billion remains available under this facility at December 31, 2001. PREVIOUSLY EXISTING DEBT AND DEBT ASSUMED UPON ACQUISITION For additional information on NRG Energys short term and long term borrowing arrangements, see Item 8 Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. PROJECTED FINANCING NEEDS NRG Energy expects to meet its future financing requirements through a combination of internally generated cash, corporate and project level long term and short term debt, equity securities and equity like securities. As outlined above, NRG Energy is expected to need approximately $7.5 billion during the period 2002 2006 in order to meet its planned construction schedule. NRG Energy plans to issue equity in the total amount of $1.1 billion during the period 2002 2006, and project level long term debt financing in the amount of $6.3 billion during this same period of time. If Xcel Energy successfully completes its tender offer, NRG Energys equity capital requirements would come from cash infusions from Xcel Energy. NRG Energy believes it will be able to raise the necessary funding in the capital markets in the near term because most of the project level construction financing has already been committed either through the $2.0 billion construction revolver or project specific construction financings. IMPACT OF A DOWNGRADE OF CREDIT RATING NRG Energys unsecured credit rating is BBB from Standard & Poorss and Baa3 from Moodys Investors Service. In December 2001, Moodys placed NRG Energys credit rating on review for potential downgrade. NRG Energys credit rating remains under review by Moodys for potential downgrade. As of December 31, 2001, NRG Energys off balance sheet obligations pursuant to its guarantees of performance, equity and indebtedness obligations of its subsidiaries totaled approximately $721.7 million. NRG Energy is directly liable for the obligations of certain of its project affiliates and other subsidiaries pursuant to guarantees relating to certain of their indebtedness, equity and operating obligations. In addition, in connection with the purchase and sale of fuel emission credits and power generation products to and from third parties with respect to the operation of some of NRG Energys generation facilities in the United States, NRG Energy may be required to guarantee a portion of the obligations of certain of its subsidiaries. If Moodys or Standard & Poors were to downgrade NRG Energy, many of the corporate guarantees and commitments currently in place would need to be supported with letters of credit or cash collateral within 5 to 30 days. As of December 31, 2001, the amount of collateral required, if NRG Energy were downgraded, was approximately $960 million, to satisfy certain of the above mentioned guarantees and obligations associated with the $2 billion construction/acquisition revolver. Of the $960 million in collateral that could be required, 41 approximately $200 million relates to NRG Energys guarantees of debt service reserve accounts required by some of its project level financings; approximately $400 million relates to NRG Energys power marketing activities; and $360 million would be required to support its Contingent Equity Guarantee associated with the $2 billion construction/acquisition revolver. Because NRG Energy limits the amount of the guarantees it issues to support NRG Power Marketings activities, and because of the relatively small number of margin accounts in place, even very large changes in market conditions would not have a material impact on the $400 million of collateral that would be required for NRG Power Marketing in the event of a downgrade. In the event of a downgrade, NRG Energy would expect to meet its collateral obligations with cash on hand, available credit lines provided under its revolving line of credit potentially from, liquidity support from Xcel Energy and the issuance of debt into capital markets. Xcel Energy has stated its plan to infuse approximately $600 million of equity into NRG Energy in 2002 in connection with its exchange offer and merger. Of this amount, $300 million has already been provided in the form of a convertible subordinated note that Xcel Energy has said it will cancel if its exchange offer and merger are completed. If the offer and merger are not completed, Xcel Energy has said it will continue to evaluate the terms and timing of any additional investment in NRG Energy. In March 2002, NRG Energy successfully replaced its corporate level $500 million unsecured revolving line of credit facility with a new 364 day $1.0 billion corporate level unsecured revolving line of credit. In addition, NRG Energy will maintain its $125 million letter of credit facility and plans to secure an additional $125 million credit facility for total credit facilities of $1.25 billion to be available in 2002. The Contingent Equity Guarantee associated with NRG Energys construction/acquisition revolver could increase to a maximum of $850 million by the end of 2002 as NRG Energy utilizes the capacity of the construction/acquisition revolver. Therefore, the amount of collateral required by the end of 2002 could increase to $1.45 billion. ASSET SALES In January 2002, NRG Energy also announced that it has reviewed its portfolio of operating assets and has identified approximately 650 MW of less strategic facilities that it plans to put up for sale in the near term and expects to raise an additional $350 $400 million cash after paying off any project level debt. OFF BALANCE SHEET ITEMS As of December 31, 2001, NRG Energy does not have any significant relationships with structured finance or special purpose entities that provide liquidity, financing or incremental market risk or credit risk. However, as noted in Item 8 Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, NRG Energy issued $250 million of 8.70% ROARS due March 2020 through an unconsolidated guarantor trust. The sole assets of the trust consist of L160 million of Reset senior notes due March 2020. NRG Energy has numerous investments of generally less then 50% interests in numerous energy and energy related entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as disclosed in Item 8 Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. NRG Energys pro rata share of non recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $940 million as of December 31, 2001. In the normal course of business NRG Energy may be asked to loan funds to these entities on both a long and short term basis. Such transactions are generally accounted for as accounts payables and receivables to/from affiliates and notes receivables from affiliates and if appropriate, bear market based interest rates. For additional information regarding amounts accounted for as notes receivables to affiliates see Item 8 Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS NRG Energy has a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to its capital expenditure programs. The following is a summarized 42 table of contractual obligations. See additional discussion in Item 8 Notes 9 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 (IN THOUSANDS) 1 3 4 5 AFTER CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS TOTAL SHORT TERM YEARS YEARS 5 YEARS Long term debt................... $ 7,791,660 $ 477,638 $274,914 $2,052,963 $4,986,145 Capital lease obligations........ 552,326 22,516 45,010 45,010 439,790 Operating leases................. 87,779 10,742 19,111 16,311 41,615 Unconditional purchase obligations.................... 1,900,000 1,900,000 Short term debt.................. 832,156 832,156 Total contractual cash obligations.................... $11,163,921 $3,243,052 $339,035 $2,114,284 $5,467,550 AMOUNT OF COMMITMENT EXPIRATION PER PERIOD AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 (IN THOUSANDS) TOTAL AMOUNTS 1 3 4 5 AFTER OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS COMMITTED SHORT TERM YEARS YEARS 5 YEARS Lines of credit........................ $2,540,000 $540,000 $ $ $2,000,000 Stand by letters of credit............. 170,287 170,287 Guarantees............................. 721,730 149,450 37,300 19,000 515,980 Standby repurchase obligations......... Other commercial commitments........... Total commercial commitments........... $3,432,017 $859,737 $37,300 $19,000 $2,515,980 INTERDEPENDENT RELATIONSHIPS NRG Energy does not have any significant interdependent relationships. Since it is a majority owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy there are certain related party transactions that take place in the normal course of business. For additional information regarding NRG Energys related party transactions see Item 8 Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. DOMESTIC ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The construction and operation of power projects are subject to stringent environmental protection and land use regulation in the United States. These laws and regulations generally require lengthy and complex processes to obtain licenses, permits and approvals from federal, state and local agencies. If such laws and regulations are tightened and NRG Energys facilities are not exempted from coverage, extensive modifications to further reduce environmental impacts could be required. NRG Energy and its subsidiaries continue to strive to exceed compliance with all environmental regulations currently applicable to their operations. However, it is not possible at this time to determine when or to what extent additional facilities or modifications of existing or planned facilities will be required as a result of changes to environmental regulations, interpretations or enforcement policies or, generally, what effect future laws or regulations may have upon NRG Energys operations. For more information on Environmental Matters see Item 8 Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FEDERAL INITIATIVES Numerous Federal and legislative initiatives are being undertaken to control pollutant emissions from fossil fuel fired combustion units. All of NRG Energys power plants will be affected in some manner by 43 changes that are expected to occur. In Congress, legislation is being proposed that would impose annual caps on U.S. power plant emissions of nitrogen oxide (NO(X)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), mercury, and, in some instances, carbon dioxide (CO(2)). NRG Energy is currently participating in the debates around such legislative proposals as a member of the Electric Power Supply Association. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is set to propose in December 2003 rules governing mercury emissions from power plants; these rules are set to be finalized on December 2004. In support of maintaining this schedule, a thorough review of existing power plant mercury emissions data is underway by USEPA and critical stakeholders. Federal rules governing ozone season NO(X) emissions across the eastern United States have been finalized and will now occur in two phases. The first phase of restrictions will occur in the Ozone Transport Commission region during the 2003 and subsequent ozone seasons; all of NRG Energys existing, wholly owned generating units in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic regions are included in this part of the program. The second phase of NO(X) reductions will extend to states within the ozone transport assessment region and restrict 2004 and subsequent ozone season NO(X) emissions in most states east of the Mississippi River. New rules governing cooling water intake structures at existing facilities are to be proposed during the first quarter of 2002 and finalized in August of 2003. These rules will specify rules governing the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures and reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact therewith. Other Federal initiatives that would govern regional haze and fine particulate matter are underway, but under extended compliance timeframes. REGIONAL INITIATIVES WEST COAST REGION The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is required under Senate Bill 28 (SB 28) to develop a schedule for retrofitting, by December 31, 2004, emission controls on existing power generation facilities. SB 28 requires that the emission control retrofit schedule be completed by CARB on or before July 1, 2002. CARBs current schedule for implementing the requirements of SB 28 show final rulemaking by spring of 2003. Because the SB 28 emission control retrofit requirements are not intended to change local or regional air quality control requirements, it is difficult to predict what, if any, additional emission controls would be required on NRG Energys California assets. The El Segundo and Long Beach Generating Stations are both regulated by the South Coast Air Quality Management Districts (SCAQMD) Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) program. This program, which regulates NO(X) emissions in the Los Angeles area, was amended on May 11, 2001 and included major changes with respect to power generation facilities. New RECLAIM Rule 2009 requires all existing power generation facilities to meet Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (BARCT) for NO(X) emissions from all utility boilers by January 1, 2003, and for all gas turbine units by January 1, 2004. Under the new rule, existing power generation facilities were required to submit compliance plans by September 1, 2001, listing how each unit at the stations would meet BARCT by the deadlines. El Segundos compliance plan did not plan for any additional NO(X) controls to meet BARCT since Units 3 & 4 are already equipped with SCR technology (first installed on Unit 4 in 1995 and on Unit 3 in 2001) and Units 1 & 2 are expected to be decommissioned in order to build a new 621 MW combined cycle plant. The SCAQMD denied the El Segundo Compliance Plan in late 2001, citing that the SCRs on Units 3 & 4 could be cost effectively modified to meet a lower NO(X) emission rate. El Segundo Power, LLC has appealed this denial because the SCAQMD criteria for cost effectiveness assumes the units operate at 100% capacity factor, which is not how they truly operate and is contradictory to SCAQMD rules. The appeal case is still pending. The Long Beach Generating Stations compliance plan demonstrated that SCR technology is neither technically feasible nor cost effective and called for approximately $1 million in modifications to the existing steam injection system to meet BARCT. This compliance plan is still pending a decision by SCAQMD. 44 NORTHEAST REGION Final rules implementing changes in air regulations in the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut were promulgated in 2000. The Connecticut rules required that existing facilities reduce their emissions of SO(2) in two steps, the first of which took place on January 1, 2002. The second milestone change is set to occur on January 1, 2003. NRG Energy is operating in full compliance with the first phase now and expects to comply with step phase changes in accordance with the established schedule. Connecticuts rules governing emissions of NO(X) were modified to restrict the average, non ozone season NO(X) emission rate to 0.15 pound per million Btu heat input. NRG Energy will comply with the new NO(X) rules, in part, through selective firing of natural gas. The new Massachusetts rules set forth schedules under which six existing coal fired power plants were required to meet stringent emission limits for NO(X), SO(2), mercury, and CO(2). Control of carbon monoxide and particulate matter emissions were reserved for future consideration. NRG Energy has submitted an Emission Control Plan (ECP) to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP) which identified natural gas reburn technology as an option for meeting the NO(X) and SO(2) limits specified in the new rule. NRG Energy is conducting ongoing discussions with MADEP with respect to finalizing its ECP. By December 1, 2002, MADEP is to complete an evaluation of the technological and economic feasibility of controlling and eliminating emissions of mercury from the combustion of solid fossil fuel in Massachusetts. Within six months of completing the feasibility evaluation, MADEP must propose emission standards for mercury, with a proposed compliance date of October 1, 2006. NRG Energy is still considering its options with respect to how it will address MADEPs CO(2) emission standards. Such options include filing a legal challenge with respect to MADEPs legal authority to regulate CO(2) emissions. New rules reducing allowable SO(2) and NO(X) emissions from large, fossil fuel fired combustion units in New York State were expected to be proposed in January 2002. No word has been released with regard to the reason the proposal of these rules has been delayed. NRG Energy has provided comments as part of New York State coalition of electricity producers on major conceptual flaws contained in pre publication releases of the proposed rule. SOUTH CENTRAL REGION The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has promulgated State Implementation Plan revisions to bring the Baton Rouge ozone non attainment area into compliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards. NRG Energy participated in development of the revisions which require NO(X) emissions to be reduced at the Big Cajun II Power Station to 0.21 pounds per million Btu heat input. This revision of the Louisiana air rules would appear to constitute a change in law covered by agreement between Louisiana Generating LLC and the electric cooperatives allowing the costs of added controls to be passed through to the cooperatives. MID ATLANTIC AND NORTH CENTRAL REGION No material impending rule changes affecting NRG Energys existing facilities have been proposed in either of these regions. INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Most of the foreign countries in which NRG Energy owns or may acquire or develop independent power projects have laws or regulations relating to the ownership or operation of electric power generation facilities. These laws and regulations are typically significant for independent power producers because they are still changing and evolving. NRG Energy retains appropriate advisors in foreign countries and seeks to design its international development and acquisition strategy to comply with and take advantage of opportunities presented by each 45 countrys energy laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that changes in such laws or regulations could not adversely affect NRG Energys international operations. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long lived assets and for Long lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." Goodwill will no longer be amortized to comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Instead, goodwill and intangible assets that will not be amortized should be tested for impairment annually and on an interim basis if an event occurs or a circumstance changes between annual tests that may reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. An impairment test is required to be performed within six months of the date of adoption, and the first annual impairment test must be performed in the year the statement is initially adopted. NRG Energy and its subsidiaries, as required, adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. At December 31, 2001, NRG Energy had intangible assets of $97.1 million, including $56.6 million of goodwill. These amounts and all intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the future will be accounted for under the new accounting standard. The new accounting standard is expected to initially increase earnings by an immaterial amount due to the elimination of regular amortization expense, but occasionally cause reductions in earnings when impairment write downs of goodwill and or intangible assets are required. Expense recognized for amortization of goodwill in 2001 was $3.8 million. NRG Energy does not expect to recognize any asset impairments as a result of adopting SFAS No. 142 in the first quarter of 2002. In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, an entity shall capitalize an asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by the same amount as the liability. SFAS No. 143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. NRG Energy has not completed its analysis of SFAS No. 143. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. SFAS No. 144 retains and expands upon the fundamental provisions of existing guidance related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. Generally, the provisions of SFAS No. 144 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. CALIFORNIA LIQUIDITY CRISIS NRG Energys California generation assets include a 57.67% interest in Crockett Cogeneration, a 39.5% interest in the Mt. Poso facility and a 50% interest in the West Coast Power partnership with Dynegy. In March 2001, the California PX filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and in April 2001, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) also filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11. PG&Es filing delayed collection of receivables owed to the Crockett facility. In September 2001, PG&E filed a proposed plan of reorganization. Under the terms of the proposed plan, which is subject to challenge by interested parties, unsecured creditors such as NRG Energys California affiliates would receive 60% of the amounts owed upon approval of the plan. The remaining 40% would be paid in negotiable debt with terms from 10 to 30 years. The California Power Exchanges (PX) ability to repay its debt is dependent on the extent to which it receives payments from PG&E and SCE. On December 21, 2001, the California bankruptcy court affirmed the Mt. Poso and Crockett Power Purchase Agreement (it had previously affirmed Mt. Posos agreement) with PG&E and, in respect of the Crockett Power Purchase Agreement, approved a twelve month 46 repayment schedule of all past due amounts totaling $49.6 million, plus interest. The first payment of $6.2 million, including accrued interest, was received on December 31, 2001. NRG Energys share of the net amounts owed to West Coast Power by the California ISO and PX totaled approximately $85.1 million as of December 31, 2001, compared to $101.8 million at December 31, 2000. These amounts reflect NRG Energys share of (a) total amounts owed to West Coast Power less (b) amounts that are currently treated as disputed revenues and are not recorded as accounts receivable in the financial statements of West Coast Power LLC, and reserves taken against accounts receivable that have been recorded in the financial statements. The decrease is primarily attributed to cash collections from the California ISO during the fourth quarter of 2001. ENRON EXPOSURE During the fourth quarter of 2001, NRG Energy recorded a net after tax expense of approximately $6.7 million related to Enron Corp.s bankruptcy. This amount includes a $14.2 million after tax charge to establish bad debt reserves, which was partially offset by a $7.5 million after tax gain on a credit swap agreement entered into as part of NRG Energys credit risk management program. NRG Energy has fully provided for its exposure to Enron; however, as with any receivable, NRG Energy will pursue collection of all amounts outstanding through the ordinary course of business. In addition, an Enron subsidiary, NEPCO, is serving as the construction contractor for two greenfield development projects, the Kendall and Nelson projects (2,336 MW combined) currently under construction in Illinois. Enron guaranteed NEPCOs obligations under the construction contracts. To date, the actual construction and engineering work on both projects has continued without disruption and NRG Energy expects the projects to achieve commercial operations on schedule. NRG Energy believes its overall construction costs for these two projects will increase by approximately $22 per kilowatt, as a result of the need to restructure the underlying construction contracts following the Enron bankruptcy.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK NRG Energy has an investment in the Kladno project in the Czech Republic. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation," requires foreign currency gains and losses to flow through the income statement if settlement of an obligation is in a currency other than the local currency of the entity. A portion of the Kladno project debt is in a non local currency (U.S. dollars and German deutsche marks). As of December 31, 2001, if the value of the Czech koruna decreases by 10% in relation to the U.S. dollar and the German deutsche mark, NRG Energy would record a $4.2 million loss (after tax) on the currency transaction adjustment. If the value of the Czech koruna increased by 10%, NRG Energy would record a $4.2 million gain (after tax) on the currency transaction adjustment. Additionally, NRG Energy has in investment in Hsin Yu in Taiwan which holds a payable denominated in U.S. Dollars. If the New Taiwan Dollar increased by 10%, NRG Energy would record a $0.8 million gain (after tax) on the currency adjustment. These currency fluctuations are inherent to the debt structure of the projects and not indicative of the long term earnings potential of the investments. NRG Energy is also subject to currency risks associated with foreign denominated distributions from international investments. In the normal course of business NRG Energy receives distributions denominated in Australian Dollar, British Pound, Euro, Hungarian Forint and Czech Koruna. Upon completion of the Itiquira plant in Brazil, NRG Energy will also be subject to currency risk with the Brazilian Real. NRG Energy engages in a Board approved strategy of hedging foreign denominated cash flows through a program of matching currency inflows and outflows, and to the extent required, fixing the U.S. Dollar equivalent of net foreign denominated distributions with currency forward and swap agreements with highly credit worthy financial institutions. As of December 31, 2001, NRG Energy had two foreign currency exchange contracts with notional amounts of $46.3 million. If the contracts had been discontinued on December 31, 2001, NRG Energy would have owed the counter parties approximately $2.4 million. INTEREST RATE RISK In order to minimize NRG Energys exposure to changes in interest rates, NRG Energy attempts to maintain 60 70% of its debt as fixed rate, which has proven historically to provide the lowest volatility and price, when calculated on an annual basis. When necessary, NRG Energy will employ the use of interest rate swaps with highly credit worthy counter parties to maintain this mix of fixed and floating rates. As of December 31, 2001, NRG energy had various interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling approximately $2.4 billion. If the swaps had been discontinued on December 31, 2001, NRG Energy would have owed the counter parties approximately $81.5 million. Based on the investment grade rating of the counter parties, NRG Energy believes that its exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by the counter parties to its hedging contracts is insignificant. NRG Energy and its subsidiaries have both long and short term debt instruments that subject it to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2001, a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on NRG Energys variable rate debt would impact net income by approximately $16.6 million. As of December 31, 2000, NRG Energy did not have a material interest rate exposure as a result of interest rate swaps, which convert floating rate debt into fixed rate debt. COMMODITY PRICE NRG Energy is exposed to commodity price variability in electricity, emission allowances and natural gas, oil and coal used to meet fuel requirements. To manage earnings volatility associated with these 49 commodity price risks, NRG Energy enters into financial instruments, which may take the form of fixed price, floating price or indexed sales or purchases, and options, such as puts, calls, basis transactions and swaps. NRG Energy utilizes a "Value at Risk" (VAR) model to estimate a maximum potential loss in the fair value of its commodity portfolio including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions. The key assumptions for the NRG Energy VaR model include (1) a lognormal distribution of price returns (2) three day holding period and (3) a 95% confidence interval. The volatility estimate is based on the implied volatility for at the money call options. This model encompasses the following generating regions: Entergy, NEPOOL, NYPP, PJM, WSCC, SPP and Main. The estimated maximum potential three day loss in fair value of its commodity portfolio, calculated using the VAR model is as follows: (IN MILLIONS) Year end December 31, 2001.................................. $ 71.7 Average..................................................... 78.8 High........................................................ 126.6 Low......................................................... 58.6 Year end December 31, 2000.................................. $116.0 Average..................................................... 80.0 High........................................................ 125.0 Low......................................................... 50.0 CREDIT RISK NRG Energy is exposed to credit risk in its risk management activities. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a counter party of its contractual obligations. NRG Energy actively manages its counter party credit risk. NRG Energy has an established credit policy in place to minimize overall credit risk. Important elements of this policy include ongoing financial reviews of all counter parties, established credit limits, as well as monitoring, managing, and mitigating credit exposure.
