Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are a wholesale power generation company, primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of power generation facilities and the sale of energy, capacity and related products in the United States and internationally. We have a diverse portfolio of electric generation facilities in terms of geography, fuel type and dispatch levels, which help us mitigate risk. We intend to maximize operating income through the efficient procurement and management of fuel supplies and maintenance services, and the sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services into attractive spot, intermediate and long term markets. We do not anticipate any significant new acquisitions or construction in the near future, and instead will focus on operational performance, asset management and debt reduction. We have already made significant reductions in capital expenditures, business development activities and personnel. Power sales, fuel procure 55 Table of Contents ment and risk management will remain key strategic elements of our operations. Our objective will be to optimize the operating income of our facilities within an appropriate risk and liquidity profile. Industry Trends. In this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss our historical results of operations and expected financial condition. During 2002 and 2003, the following factors, among others, have negatively affected our results of operations: weak markets for electric energy, capacity and ancillary services; a narrowing of the spark spread (the difference between power prices and fuel costs) in most regions of the United States in which we operate power generation facilities; mild weather during peak seasons in regions where we have significant merchant capacity; reduced liquidity in the energy trading markets as a result of fewer participants trading lower volumes; the imposition of price caps and other market mitigation in markets where we have significant merchant capacity; regulatory and market frameworks in certain regions where we operate that prevent us from charging prices that will enable us to recover our operating costs and to earn acceptable returns on capital; the obligation to perform under certain long term contracts that are not profitable; physical, regulatory and market constraints on transmission facilities in certain regions that limit or prevent us from selling power generated by certain of our facilities; and limited access to capital due to our financial condition since July 2002 and the resulting contraction of our ability to conduct business in the merchant energy markets. We expect that these generally weak market conditions will continue for the foreseeable future in some markets. Historically, we have believed that, as supply surpluses begin to tighten and as market rules and regulatory conditions stabilize, prices will improve for energy, capacity and ancillary services. This view is consistent with our belief that in the long run market prices will support an adequate rate of return on the construction of new power generation assets needed to meet increasing demand. This view is currently being challenged in certain markets as regulatory actions and market rules unfold that limit the ability of merchant power companies to earn favorable returns on existing and new investments. To the extent unfavorable regulatory and market conditions exist in the long term, we could have significant impairments of our property, plant and equipment, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, this could lead to us closing certain of our facilities resulting in additional economic losses and liabilities. Asset Sales. As part of our strategy, we plan to continue the selective divestment of certain assets. Since July 2002, we have sold or made arrangements to sell a number of assets and equity investments. In addition, we are currently marketing our interest in certain other non strategic assets. Discontinued Operations. We have classified certain business operations, and gains/losses recognized on sale, as discontinued operations for projects that were sold or have met the required criteria for such classification pending final disposition. Accounting regulations require that continuing operations are reported separately in the income statement from discontinued operations, and that any gain or loss on the disposition of any such business be reported along with the operating results of such business. Assets classified as discontinued operations on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 include McClain. For the periods January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, discontinued results of operations include our Killingholme, McClain, NEO Landfill Gas, Inc., NEO Fort Smith LLC, NEO Woodville LLC, NEO Phoenix LLC, Timber Energy Resources, Inc., Cahua and Energia Pacasmayo projects. All prior periods presented have been restated accordingly. For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, discontinued results of operations included McClain. New Management. On October 21, 2003, we announced the appointment of David Crane as our new President and Chief Executive Officer, effective December 1, 2003. Before joining us, Mr. Crane served as the Chief Executive Officer of London based International Power PLC and has over 12 years of energy industry 56 Table of Contents experience. On March 11, 2004 we announced the appointment of Robert Flexon as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective March 29, 2004. Before joining us Mr. Flexon served as Vice President, Work Processes, Corporate Resources and Development at Hercules, Inc. In addition, we have filled several other senior and middle management positions over the last 12 months. Our board of directors currently is comprised of Mr. Crane and ten other independent individuals, three of whom have been designated by MatlinPatterson. Independent Public Accountants; Audit Committee. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has been our independent auditor since 1995. Our new board of directors has appointed an audit committee consisting entirely of independent directors. Pursuant to the charter, the committee appoints, retains, oversees, evaluates, compensates and terminates on its sole authority our independent auditors and approves all audit engagements, including the scope, fees and terms of each engagement. The audit committees oversight process is intended to ensure that we will continue to have high quality, cost efficient independent auditing services. Results of Operations Due to the adoption of Fresh Start as of December 5, 2003, Reorganized NRGs balance sheet, statement of operations and statement of cash flows have not been prepared on a consistent basis with, and are therefore generally not comparable to those of the Predecessor Company prior to the application of Fresh Start. In accordance with SOP 90 7, Reorganized NRGs balance sheet, statement of operations and statement of cash flows have been presented separately from those of the Predecessor Company. Reorganized NRGs revenues from majority owned operations, operating costs and expenses, general, administrative and development expenses, write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments, restructuring and impairment charges and legal settlement costs were not significantly affected by the adoption of Fresh Start. Therefore, the Predecessor Companys 2003 amounts have been combined with Reorganized NRGs 2003 amounts for comparison and analysis purposes herein. Predecessor Company Reorganized NRG For the Period For the Period Year Ended December 31, January 1 December 6 December 5, December 31, 2001 2002 2003 2003 Total 2003 (In thousands) Revenues from majority owned operations $ 2,208,181 $ 2,119,385 $ 1,968,579 $ 152,108 $ 2,120,687 Cost of majority owned operations 1,429,246 1,440,434 1,448,268 105,182 1,553,450 General, administrative and development 192,087 226,168 177,112 14,925 192,037 Reorganized NRGs net loss, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, depreciation and amortization, other income (expense), income taxes and discontinued operations were affected by the adoption of 57 Table of Contents Fresh Start. Therefore, the Predecessor Companys 2003 and the Reorganized NRGs 2003 amounts are discussed separately for comparison and analysis purposes herein. Reorganized Predecessor Company NRG For the Period For the Period Year Ended December 31 January 1 December 6 December 5, December 31, 2001 2002 2003 2003 (In thousands) Net (loss) income $ 265,204 $ (3,464,282 ) $ 2,766,445 $ 11,025 Depreciation and amortization 163,909 240,722 245,887 13,041 Other (expense)/income (161,885 ) (590,325 ) (327,434 ) (6,669 ) Other charges (credits) 2,749,630 (2,997,510 ) 2,461 Income tax (benefit)/expense 39,061 (164,398 ) 16,621 (651 ) Income/(loss) from discontinued operations 43,211 (500,786 ) 15,678 544 For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Net Income Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we recorded net income of $2.8 billion. Net income for the period is directly attributable to our emerging from bankruptcy and adopting the Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90 7. Upon the confirmation of our Plan of Reorganization and our emergence from bankruptcy we were able to remove significant amounts of long term debt and other prepetition obligations from our balance sheet. Accordingly, as part of net income from continuing operations, we recorded a net gain of $3.9 billion as the impact of our adopting Fresh Start in our statement of operations, $6.0 billion of this amount is directly related to the forgiveness of debt and settlement of substantial amounts of our pre petition obligations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. In addition to the removal of substantial amounts of pre petition debt and other obligations from our balance sheet, we have also revalued our assets and liabilities to fair value, accordingly we have substantially written down the value of our fixed assets. We have recorded a net $1.7 billion charge related to the revaluation of our assets and liabilities within the Fresh Start Reporting adjustment line of our consolidated statement of operations. In addition to our recording adjustments related to our emergence from bankruptcy, we also recorded substantial charges related to other items such as the settlement of certain outstanding litigation in the amount of $462.6 million, write downs and losses on the sale of equity investments of $147.1 million, advisor cost and legal fees directly attributable to our being in bankruptcy of $197.8 million and $237.6 million of other asset impairment and restructuring costs incurred prior to our filing for bankruptcy. Net income for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 was also favorably impacted by our not recording interest expense on substantial amounts of corporate level debt while we were in bankruptcy and by the continued favorable results experienced by our equity investments. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized a net loss of $3.5 billion. The loss from continuing operations incurred during 2002 primarily consisted of $2.7 billion of other charges consisting primarily of asset impairments. Reorganized NRG During the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, we recognized net income of $11.0 million or $0.11 per share of common stock. Net income was directly attributable to a number of factors some of which are discussed below. From an overall operational perspective our facilities were profitable during this period. Our results were adversely impacted by our having to continue to satisfy the standard offer service contract that we entered into with Connecticut Light & Power, or CL&P in 2000. As a result of our inability to terminate this contract during our bankruptcy proceeding we continued to be exposed to losses under this contract. These losses were incurred, as we were unable to satisfy the requirements of this contract 58 Table of Contents at a price/cost below the contracted sales price. Upon our adoption of Fresh Start, we recorded at fair value, all assets and liabilities on our opening balance sheet and accordingly we recorded as an obligation the fair value of the CL&P contract. During the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, we recognized as revenues, the entire fair value of this contract effectively offsetting the actual losses incurred under this contract. The CL&P contract terminated on December 31, 2003. Revenues from Majority Owned Operations Our operating revenues from majority owned operations were $2.1 billion in 2003, compared to $2.1 billion in the prior year, an increase of $1.3 million or less than 1%. Revenues from majority owned operations of $2.1 billion for the year 2003, includes $1.1 billion of energy revenues, $649.1 million of capacity revenues, $192.8 million of alternative energy, $15.3 of O&M fees and $153.5 million of other revenues which include financial and physical gas sales, sales from our Schkopau facility and NEPOOL expense reimbursements. The increase of $1.3 million is due to increased capacity revenues resulting from additional projects becoming operational in the later part of 2002, higher sales in New York, and by our recognizing, as additional revenues, the fair value of the out of market CL&P contract upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Offsetting these increases, we continued to recognize losses on the CC&P contract throughout 2003 resulting from higher market prices and lower generation. Cost of Majority Owned Operations Our cost of majority owned operations related to continuing operations was $1.6 billion in 2003, compared to $1.4 billion for 2002, an increase of $113.0 million or 7.8%. For 2003 and 2002, cost of majority owned operations represented 73.3% and 68.0% of revenues from majority owned operations, respectively. Cost of majority owned operations, consists primarily of cost of energy (primarily fuel costs), labor, operating and maintenance costs and non income based taxes related to our majority owned operations. For the year 2003, cost of energy was $956.4 million compared to $965.7 million for 2002, representing a decrease of $9.3 million. As a percent of revenue from majority owned operations, cost of energy was 45.1% and 45.6%, for 2003 and 2002, respectively. This decrease was a result of an overall decrease in the cost of fuel during 2003 and a favorable change in the fair value of our energy related derivatives resulting from contract terminations. Offsetting this decrease are liquidated damages of $72.9 million triggered from our financial condition. Depreciation and Amortization Predecessor Company Our depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing operations was $245.9 million for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and $240.7 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Depreciation and amortization consists of the allocation of our historical depreciable fixed asset costs over the remaining lives of such property as well as the amortization of certain contract based intangible assets. Reorganized NRG Our depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing operations was $13.0 million for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Depreciation and amortization consists of the allocation of our newly valued basis in our fixed assets over newly determined remaining fixed asset lives. As part of adopting the Fresh Start concepts of SOP 90 7 our tangible fixed assets were recorded at fair value as determined by a third party valuation expert who we also consulted with in determining the appropriate remaining lives for our tangible depreciable property. Depreciation expense for this period was based on preliminary depreciable lives and asset balances. 59 Table of Contents General, Administrative and Development Our general, administrative and development costs for 2003 were $192.0 million compared to $226.2 million for 2002, a decrease of $34.1 million or 15.1%. For 2003 and 2002, general, administrative and development costs represent 9.1% and 10.7% of revenues from majority owned operations, respectively. This decrease is due to decreased costs related to work force reduction efforts, cost reductions due to the closure of certain international offices and reduced legal costs. Outside services also decreased, due to less non restructuring legal activities. Other Charges (Credits) During the year 2003, we recorded other credits of $3.0 billion, which consisted primarily of $228.9 million related to asset impairments, $462.6 million related to legal settlements and $197.8 million related to reorganization charges and $8.7 million related to restructuring charges. We also incurred a $3.9 billion credit related to Fresh Start adjustments. During 2002, we recorded other charges of $2.7 billion, which consisted primarily of $2.6 billion related to asset impairments and $111.3 million related to restructuring charges. We review the recoverability of our long lived assets on a periodic basis and if we determined that an asset was impaired, we compared asset carrying values to total future estimated undiscounted cash flows. Separate analyses are completed for assets or groups of assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The estimates of future cash flows included only future cash flows, net of associated cash outflows, directly associated with and expected to arise as a result of our assumed use and eventual disposition of the asset. Cash flow estimates associated with assets in service are based on the assets existing service potential. The cash flow estimates may include probability weightings to consider possible alternative courses of action and outcomes, given the uncertainty of available information and prospective market conditions. If an asset was determined to be impaired based on the cash flow testing performed, an impairment loss was recorded to write down the asset to its fair value. Estimates of fair value were based on prices for similar assets and present value techniques. Fair values determined by similar asset prices reflect our current estimate of recoverability from expected marketing of project assets. For fair values determined by projected cash flows, the fair value represents a discounted cash flow amount over the remaining life of each project that reflects project specific assumptions for long term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs, and expected plant operation given assumed market conditions. 60 Table of Contents Impairment charges (credits) included the following for the year ended December 31, 2002 and for the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003 and the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003.

All reorganization costs have been incurred since we filed for bankruptcy in May 2003. The following table provides the detail of the types of costs incurred (in thousands): Predecessor Reorganized Company NRG For the Period For the Period January 1 December 6 December 5, December 31, 2003 2003 Reorganization items Professional fees $ 82,186 $ 2,461 Deferred financing costs 55,374 Pre payment settlement 19,609 Interest earned on accumulated cash (1,059 ) Contingent equity obligation 41,715 Total reorganization items $ 197,825 $ 2,461 Restructuring Charges We incurred total restructuring charges of approximately $111.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. These costs consisted of employee separation costs and advisor fees. We incurred an additional $8.7 million of employee separation costs and advisor fees during 2003 until we filed for bankruptcy in May 2003. Subsequent to that date we recorded all advisor fees as reorganization costs. Legal Settlement Costs During 2003, we recorded $396.0 million in connection with the resolution of the FirstEnergy Arbitration Claim. As a result of this resolution, FirstEnergy retained ownership of the Lake Plant Assets and received an allowed general unsecured claim of $396 million under the NRG plan of reorganization submitted to the bankruptcy court. In November 2003, we settled various litigation with Fortistar Capital in which Fortistar Capital released us from all litigation claims in exchange for a $60.0 million pre petition claim and an $8.0 million post petition claim. We had previously recorded $10.8 million in connection with various legal disputes with Fortistar Capital; accordingly, we recorded an additional $57.2 million during November 2003. In August of 1995, we entered into a Marketing, Development and Joint Proposing Agreement or the Marketing Agreement, with Cambrian Energy Development LLC, or Cambrian. Various claims had arisen in connection with this Marketing Agreement. In November 2003, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Cambrian where we agreed to transfer our 100% interest in three gasco projects (NEO Ft. Smith, NEO Phoenix and NEO Woodville) and our 50% interest in two genco projects (MM Phoenix and MM Woodville) to Cambrian. In addition, we agreed to pay approximately $1.8 million in settlement of royalties incurred in connection with the Marketing Agreement. We had previously recorded a liability for royalties owed to Cambrian, therefore, we recorded an additional $1.4 million during November 2003. In November 2003, we settled our dispute with Dick Corporation in connection with Meriden Gas Turbines, which resulted in our recording an additional liability of $8.0 million in November, 2003. 62 Table of Contents Fresh Start Adjustments During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a credit of $3.9 billion in connection with fresh start adjustments as discussed in Item 15 Note 3. Following is a summary of the significant effects of the reorganization and Fresh Start: (In millions) Discharge of corporate level debt $ 5,162 Discharge of other liabilities 811 Establishment of creditor pool (1,040 ) Receivable from Xcel 640 Revaluation of fixed assets (1,392 ) Revaluation of equity investments (207 ) Valuation of SO 2 emission credits 374 Valuation of out of market contracts, net (400 ) Fair market valuation of debt 108 Valuation of pension liabilities (61 ) Other valuation adjustments (100 ) Total Fresh Start adjustments $ 3,895 Other Income (Expense) Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we recorded other expense of $327.4 million. Other expense consisted primarily of $360.4 million of interest expense and $147.1 million of write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments, partially offset by equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $170.9 million and $11.4 million of other income. For the year ended December 31, 2002, other expenses was $590.3 million, which consisted primarily of $487.2 million of interest expense and $200.5 million of write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments. Interest expense for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 of $360.4 million consisted of interest expense on both our project and corporate level interest bearing debt. In addition, interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs and any interest rate swap termination costs. Subsequent to our entering into bankruptcy we ceased the recording of interest expense on our corporate level debt as these prepetition claims were deemed to be impaired and subject to compromise. We did not however cease to record interest expense on the project level debt outstanding at our Northeast Generating and South Central Generating facilities even though these entities were also in bankruptcy as these claims were deemed to be most likely not impaired and not subject to compromise. We also recorded substantial amounts of fees and costs related to our acquiring a debtor in possession financing arrangement while we were in bankruptcy. In addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy we wrote off any remaining deferred finance costs related to our corporate and project level debt including our Northeast and South Central project level debt as it was probable that they would be refinanced upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Write Downs and Losses on Sales of Equity Method Investments As we periodically review our equity method investments for impairments we have taken substantial write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments during the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and for the year 2002. In 2003 we recorded impairments and losses on the sales of investments of $147.1 million compared to $200.5 million in 2002. The $147.1 million recorded in 2003 consists of the write down of our investment in the Loy Yang project of $146.4 million and our investment in the NEO Corporation Minnesota Methane project of $12.3 million during 2003. These losses were partially 63 Table of Contents offset by gains on the sale of our investment in the ECKG and Mustang projects. During 2002 we recorded write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments of $200.5 million. The $200.5 million recorded in 2002 consists of a write down of our investment in the Loy Yang project of $111.4 million, a loss of $48.4 million on the transfer of our interest in the Sabine River Works project to our partner, a $14.2 million write down related to our investment in our EDL project, a write down of our investment in our Kondapalli project of $12.7 million and a write down of our investment in NEO Corporation Minnesota Methane and MM Biogas of $12.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively among others. See Item 15 Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, minority interest in (earnings)/losses of consolidated subsidiaries was $(2.2) million, compared to $20.3 million, an increase of $22.5 million, as compared to 2002. The increase is primarily due to favorable results at PERC. Reorganized NRG Other income (expense) for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, was an expense of $6.7 million and consisted primarily of $21.6 million of interest expense, partially offset by $13.5 million of equity earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries. Interest expense for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 of $21.6 million consists primarily of interest expense at the corporate level, primarily related to the newly issued high yield notes, term loan facility and revolving line of credit used to refinance certain project level financings. In addition, interest expense includes the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred as a result of our refinancing efforts and the amortization of discounts and premiums recorded upon the marking of our debt to fair value upon our adoption of the Fresh Start provision of SOP 90 7. Equity Earnings from Unconsolidated Affiliates Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we recorded $170.9 million of equity earnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Our 50% investment in West Coast Power comprised $98.7 million of this amount with our investments in the Mibrag, Loy Yang, Gladstone and Rocky Road projects comprising $21.8 million, $17.9 million, $12.4 million and $6.9 million, respectively, with the remaining amounts attributable to various domestic and international equity investments. Our investment in West Coast Power continues to generate favorable earnings as well as our investments in Mibrag, Loy Yang, Gladstone and Rocky Road. For the year ended December 31, 2002, equity earnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was $69.0 million. Reorganized NRG Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $13.5 million consists primarily of equity earnings from our 50% ownership in West Coast Power of $9.3 million. Discontinued Operations Predecessor Company As of December 5, 2003, we classified as discontinued operations the operations and gains/losses recognized on the sales of projects that were sold or were deemed to have met the required criteria for such classification pending final disposition. For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, discontinued operations consist of the historical operations and net gains/losses related to our Killingholme, McClain, NLGI, NEO Corporation projects, TERI, Cahua and Energia Pacasmayo projects. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 consisted of our Crockett Cogeneration, Entrade, Killingholme, Csepel, Bulo Bulo, McClain, NLGI and TERI, Cahua and Energia Pacasmayo projects. 64 Table of Contents For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, the results of operations related to such discontinued operations was a net gain of $15.7 million. The reason for the gain recognized during the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, was the completion of the sale of our interest in Killingholme resulting in a net gain of $191.2 million, offset by the loss on the sale of our Peru projects, impairment charges recorded at McClain and NLGI. During 2002 we recognized a loss on discontinued operations of $500.8 million due to asset impairments recorded at Killingholme, NLGI and TERI projects. Reorganized NRG Discontinued operations for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 is comprised of a gain of $0.5 million attributable to the on going operations of our McClain project. Income Tax Predecessor Company Income tax (benefit)/expense for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 was a tax expense of $16.6 million as compared to a tax benefit of ($164.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The income tax expense for the period ended December 5, 2003 was primarily due to separate company income tax liabilities and an increase in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. An additional valuation allowance of $33 million was recorded against deferred tax assets of NRG West Coast as a result of its conversion from a corporation to a single member limited liability company (a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes). The effective income tax rate for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 is relatively low since the U.S. net operating loss carryforwards are offset by the cancellation of debt income resulting from the Bankruptcy. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2002 was primarily due to the increase in deferred tax assets relating to impairments recognized for financial reporting purposes. A valuation allowance was increased limiting the recognition of deferred tax assets to the extent of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities. Income taxes have been recorded on the basis that our U.S. subsidiaries and we will file separate federal income tax returns for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. Since our U.S. subsidiaries and we will not be included in the Xcel Energy consolidated tax group, each of our U.S. subsidiaries that is classified as a corporation for U.S. income tax purposes must file a separate federal income tax return. It is uncertain if, on a stand alone basis, we would be able to fully realize deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary differences, therefore a full valuation allowance has been established. Reorganized NRG Income tax (benefit)/expense for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 was a tax benefit of ($0.7) million which consists of a U.S. tax benefit of ($1.5) million and foreign tax expense of $0.8 million. The foreign tax expense for the period is due to earnings in the foreign jurisdictions. Our U.S. subsidiaries and we will file a consolidated federal income tax return for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. With the exception of alternative minimum tax, or AMT, we anticipate that our cash tax rate for the next 5 years will be relatively low as we realize the cash tax benefits from using our net operating loss carryforwards. For AMT purposes, utilization of net operating losses is limited on an annual basis. Due to the uncertainty of realization of deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary differences, the change in U.S. current and deferred income taxes has been fully offset by a change in the valuation allowance and our U.S. net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2003 were offset by a full valuation allowance in accordance with SFAS 109. Regarding the valuation allowance as of December 5, 2003, SOP 90 7 requires any future benefits from reducing the valuation allowance from preconfirmation net 65 Table of Contents operating loss carryforwards be reported as a direct addition to paid in capital versus a benefit on our income statement. Consequently, our effective tax rate in post Bankruptcy emergence years will not benefit from utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards which were fully valued as of the date of our emergence from Bankruptcy. As of December 31, 2003, our management intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings from our foreign operations. Accordingly, U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes were not provided on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. For the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001 Net Loss During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized a net loss of $3.5 billion. This loss represented a decrease in earnings of $3.7 billion compared to net income of $265.2 million for the same period in 2001. Our loss from continuing operations was $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to net income of $222.0 million from continuing operations for the same period in 2001. The loss from continuing operations incurred during 2002 primarily consists of $2.7 billion of other charges consisting primarily of asset impairments. During 2002, our continuing operations experienced less favorable results than those experienced during the same period in 2001. Overall, our domestic power generation operations performed poorly compared to the same period in 2001. Our domestic operations experienced reductions in domestic energy and capacity sales and an overall decrease in power pool prices and related spark spreads (the monetary difference between the price of power and fuel cost). During the fourth quarter of 2002, an additional reserve for uncollectible receivables in California was established by West Coast Power, the California joint venture of which we own 50%, which reduced our equity in the earnings of that joint venture by approximately $58.5 million on a pre tax basis. In addition, West Coast Powers results were already less than those recorded in 2001 due to less favorable contracts and reductions in sales of energy and capacity. In addition, increased administrative costs, depreciation and interest expense from completed construction costs also contributed to the less than favorable results in 2002. Partially offsetting these earnings reductions was the recognition, in the fourth quarter of 2002, of approximately $51.0 million of additional revenues related to the contractual termination of a power purchase agreement with our Indian River project. During the third quarter of 2002, we experienced credit rating downgrades, defaults under certain credit agreements, increased collateral requirements and reduced liquidity. These events led to impairments of a number of our assets, resulting in pre tax charges related to continuing operations of approximately $2.6 billion during 2002. In addition, approximately $200.5 million of net losses on sales and write downs of equity method investments were recorded in 2002. Operating results of majority owned projects that were sold or have met the criteria to be considered as held for sale have been classified as discontinued operations. The period ended December 31, 2002, consisted of the historical operations and net gains/losses related to our Crockett Cogeneration, Entrade, Killingholme, Csepel, Bulo Bulo, McClain, NLGI, NEO Fort Smith LLC, NEO Woodville LLC, NEO Phoenix LLC, TERI, Cahua and Energia Pacasmayo. During 2002, we expensed approximately $111.3 million for costs related to our financial restructuring. These costs include expenses for financial and legal advisors, contract termination costs, employee separation and other restructuring activities. Revenues from Majority Owned Operations Our operating revenues from majority owned operations were $2.1 billion in 2002 compared to $2.2 billion in the prior year, a decrease of $88.8 million or approximately 4.0%. Revenues from majority owned operations for the year ended December 31, 2002, consisted primarily of power generation revenues from domestic operations of approximately $1.6 billion in 2002 compared with $1.7 billion in 2001, a decrease 66 Table of Contents of $132.8 million. This decrease in domestic generation revenue is due to reductions in energy and capacity sales and an overall decrease in power pool prices. The Northeast region experienced decreased revenues, as they were significantly affected by a combination of lower capacity revenues and a decline in megawatt hour generation compared with 2001. This decline in generation is attributable to an unseasonably warm winter and cooler spring and a slowing economy, which reduced demand for electricity, together with new regulation, which reduced price volatility, particularly in New York City. The South Central region generated increased revenues primarily due to a full year of operations compared to plants acquired and completed in 2001. Our International revenues from majority owned operations increased by $36.3 million or 10.9% from 2001 to 2002. The Asia Pacific region reported a reduction in revenues of $9.8 million while increases were reported from Europe of $34.9 million and Latin America of $11.2 million. The reduction in Asia Pacific revenue is primarily due to a decline in energy prices and the loss of a significant contract at Flinders. The increase in Europe and Latin America revenue is primarily due to a full year of operations for acquisitions made in 2001. Operating Costs and Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2002, cost of majority owned operations related to continuing operations was $1.4 billion compared to $1.4 billion for 2001, an increase of $11.2 million or approximately 0.8%. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, cost of majority owned operations represented approximately 68.0% and 64.7% of revenues from majority owned operations, respectively. Cost of majority owned operations consists primarily of cost of energy (primarily fuel costs), labor, operating and maintenance costs and non income based taxes related to our majority owned operations. For the year ended December 31, 2002, cost of energy was $965.7 million compared to $995.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This represents a decrease of $29.3 million or 2.9%. As a percent of revenue from majority owned operations cost of energy was 45.1% and 45.1% for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2002, operating and maintenance costs were $399.0 compared to $347.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This represents an increase of $51.6 million or 14.9%. As a percent of revenue from majority owned operations, operating and maintenance costs represented 18.8% and 15.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in operating and maintenance expense is primarily due to a full year of expense in 2002 related to assets acquired during 2001. Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2002, depreciation and amortization related to continuing operations was $240.7 million, compared to $163.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $76.8 million or approximately 46.9%. This increase is primarily due to the addition of property, plant and equipment related to our acquisitions of electric generating facilities completed during 2002. General, Administrative and Development For the year ended December 31, 2002, general, administrative and development costs were $226.2 million, compared to $192.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $34.1 million or approximately 17.7%. For the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, general, administrative and development costs represent 10.7% and 8.7% of revenues from majority owned operations, respectively. This increase is primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense. Additionally there was an increase in other general administrative expenses due to 2001 acquisitions and newly constructed facilities coming on line. These increases were partially offset by decreases in business development expenses and other reductions to costs previously incurred to support international and expanded operations. 67 Table of Contents Other Charges During the third quarter of 2002, we experienced credit rating downgrades, defaults under certain credit agreements, increased collateral requirements and reduced liquidity. We applied the provisions of SFAS No. 144 to our construction and operational projects. We completed an analysis of the recoverability of the asset carrying values of our projects factoring in the probability of different courses of action available to us given our financial position and liquidity constraints. As a result, we determined during the third quarter that many of our construction projects and certain operational projects were impaired and should be written down to fair market value. To estimate fair value, our management considered discounted cash flow analyses, bids and offers related to those projects and prices of similar assets. During 2002, we recorded asset impairment and other special charges related to continuing operations of $2.7 billion. See Item 15 Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other Income (Expense) For the year ended December 31, 2002, total other expense was $590.3 million, compared to $161.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $428.4 million or approximately 264.7%. The increase in total other expense from 2001 consisted primarily of an increase in interest expense and $200.5 million of write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments combined with lower equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we had equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $69.0 million, compared to $210.0 million for 2001, a decrease of $141.0 million or approximately 67.1%. The $141.0 million decrease in equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates is due primarily to unfavorable results at West Coast Power in 2002 as compared to the same period in 2001. During 2002, West Coast Power had long term contracts that were less favorable than those held in 2001. In addition during 2002, West Coast Power established reserves for certain receivables not considered recoverable from California PX. Our share of this reserve was approximately $58.5 million on a pre tax basis. For the year ended December 31, 2002, interest expense (which includes both corporate and project level interest expense) was $487.2 million, compared to $389.9 million in 2001, an increase of $97.3 million or approximately 25.0%. This increase is due primarily to increased corporate and project level debt. We issued substantial amounts of long term debt at both the corporate level (recourse debt) and project level (non recourse debt) to either directly finance the acquisition of electric generating facilities or refinance short term bridge loans incurred to finance such acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2002, minority interest in (earnings)/ losses of consolidated subsidiaries was $20.3 million, compared to $(0.8) million, a decrease of $21.1 million, as compared to 2001. This decrease is primarily due to increased earnings from COBEE for the year ended December 31, 2002. Other income was a gain of $8.0 million, as compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of $10.8 million, or approximately 57.4%. Other income consists primarily of interest income on cash balances and realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Interest income was lower during 2002 due to lower interest from affiliates, primarily related to West Coast Power. In addition, there were significant foreign currency exchange losses during 2002. Write Downs and Losses on Sales of Equity Method Investments For the year ended December 31, 2002, write downs and losses on equity method investments were $200.5 million. The $200.5 million charge consists primarily of write downs related to our investment in Loy Yang in the total amount of $111.4 million. In addition, we recorded a loss of $48.4 million upon the transfer of our investment in SRW Cogeneration and recorded write downs of $14.2 million and $3.6 million of our investments in EDL and Collinsville, respectively. 68 Table of Contents Income Tax Income tax (benefit)/expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was a tax benefit of ($164.4) million as compared to a tax expense of $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2002 was primarily due to the increase in deferred tax assets relating to impairments recognized for financial reporting purposes. A valuation allowance was increased limiting the recognition of deferred tax assets to the extent of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities. The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was primarily due to U.S. and foreign operating earnings reduced by tax credits of $37.2 million. For 2002, income taxes were recorded on the basis that Xcel Energy would not include us in its consolidated federal income tax return following Xcel Energys acquisition of our public shares on June 3, 2002. Since Xcel Energy did not include us in its consolidated federal income tax return, we and each of our U.S. subsidiaries that is classified as a corporation for U.S. income tax purposes must file separate federal income tax returns. It is uncertain if, on a stand alone basis, we will be able to fully realize deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary differences, consequently, a valuation allowance of $1.3 billion was recorded as of December 31, 2002. For 2001, our U.S. subsidiaries and we were included in the Xcel Energy consolidated federal income tax return through March 12, 2001, the date of our secondary public offering. For the remainder of the year, we filed a consolidated federal return with our U.S. subsidiaries. Income tax expense was recorded on current and deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by benefits from tax credits. Discontinued Operations As of December 31, 2002, we classified the operations and gains/losses recognized on the sales of certain entities as discontinued operations. Discontinued operations consist of the historical operations and net gains/losses related to our Crockett Cogeneration, Entrade, Killingholme, Csepel, Bulo Bulo, McClain, NLGI, NEO Fort Smith LLC, NEO Woodville LLC, NEO Phoenix LLC, TERI, Cahua and Energia Pacasmayo that were sold in 2002 or were deemed to have met the required criteria for such classification pending final disposition. For 2002, the results of operations related to such discontinued operations was a net loss of $500.8 million as compared to a gain of $43.2 million for the same period in 2001. The primary reason for the loss recognized in 2002 is due to asset impairments recorded at Killingholme, TERI and NLGI. Reorganization and Emergence from Bankruptcy On May 14, 2003, we and 25 of our U.S. affiliates, filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, or the bankruptcy court. On May 15, 2003, NRG Energy, PMI, NRG Finance Company I LLC, NRGenerating Holdings (No. 23) B.V. and NRG Capital LLC, collectively the Plan Debtors, filed the NRG plan of reorganization and the related Disclosure Statement for Reorganizing Debtors Joint Plan of Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as subsequently amended, the Disclosure Statement. The Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the Disclosure Statement on June 30, 2003, and instructed the Plan Debtors to include certain additional disclosures. The Plan Debtors amended the Disclosure Statement and obtained Bankruptcy Court approval for the Third Amended Disclosure Statement for Debtors Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On November 24, 2003, the bankruptcy court issued an order confirming the NRG plan of reorganization, and the plan became effective on December 5, 2003. On September 17, 2003, the Northeast/ South Central plan of reorganization was proposed after we secured the necessary financing commitments. On November 25, 2003, the bankruptcy court issued an order confirming the Northeast/ South Central plan of reorganization and the plan became effective on December 23, 2003. 69 Table of Contents Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code and Fresh Start Between May 14, 2003 and December 5, 2003, we operated as a debtor in possession under the supervision of the bankruptcy court. Our financial statements for reporting periods within that timeframe were prepared in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 90 7, Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code, or SOP 90 7. For financial reporting purposes, the close of business on December 5, 2003, represents the date of emergence from bankruptcy. As used herein, the following terms refer to the Company and its operations: Predecessor Company The Company, pre emergence from bankruptcy The Companys operations, January 1, 2001 December 5, 2003 Reorganized NRG The Company, post emergence from bankruptcy The Companys operations, December 6, 2003 December 31, 2003 The implementation of the NRG plan of reorganization resulted in, among other things, a new capital structure, the satisfaction or disposition of various types of claims against the Predecessor Company, the assumption or rejection of certain contracts, and the establishment of a new board of directors. In connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted Fresh Start in accordance with the requirements of SOP 90 7. The application of SOP 90 7 resulted in the creation of a new reporting entity. Under Fresh Start, the enterprise value of our company was allocated among our assets and liabilities on a basis substantially consistent with purchase accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations, or SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, we pushed down the effects of this allocation to all of our subsidiaries. Under the requirements of Fresh Start, we have adjusted our assets and liabilities, other than deferred income taxes, to their estimated fair values as of December 5, 2003. As a result of marking our assets and liabilities to their estimated fair values, we determined that there was no excess reorganization value that was reallocated back to our tangible and intangible assets. Deferred taxes were determined in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The net effect of all Fresh Start adjustments resulted in a gain of $3.9 billion, which is reflected in the Predecessor Companys results of operations for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. The application of the Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90 7 created a new reporting entity having no retained earnings or accumulated deficit. As part of the bankruptcy process we engaged an independent financial advisor to assist in the determination of our reorganized enterprise value. The fair value calculation was based on managements forecast of expected cash flows from our core assets. Managements forecast incorporated forward commodity market prices obtained from a third party consulting firm. A discounted cash flow calculation was used to develop the enterprise value of Reorganized NRG, determined in part by calculating the weighted average cost of capital of the Reorganized NRG. The Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, valuation methodology equates the value of an asset or business to the present value of expected future economic benefits to be generated by that asset or business. The DCF methodology is a forward looking approach that discounts expected future economic benefits by a theoretical or observed discount rate. The independent financial advisors prepared a 30 year cash flow forecast using a discount rate of approximately 11%. The resulting reorganization enterprise value as included in the Disclosure Statement ranged from $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion. The independent financial advisor then subtracted our project level debt and made several other adjustments to reflect the values of assets held for sale, excess cash and collateral requirements to estimate a range of Reorganized NRG equity value of between $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion. In constructing our Fresh Start balance sheet upon our emergence from bankruptcy we used a reorganization equity value of approximately $2.4 billion, as we believe this value to be the best indication of the value of the ownership distributed to the new equity owners. Our NRG Plan of reorganization provided for the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of NRG common stock to the various creditors resulting in a calculated price per share of $24.04. Our reorganization value of approximately $9.1 billion was determined by adding our reorganized equity value of $2.4 billion, $3.7 billion of interest bearing debt and our other liabilities of 70 Table of Contents $3.0 billion. The reorganization value represents the fair value of an entity before liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after restructuring. This value is consistent with the voting creditors and bankruptcy courts approval of the NRG plan of reorganization. We recorded approximately $3.9 billion of net reorganization income in the Predecessor Companys statement of operations for 2003, which includes the gain on the restructuring of equity and the discharge of obligations subject to compromise for less than recorded amounts, as well as adjustments to the historical carrying values of our assets and liabilities to fair market value. Due to the adoption of Fresh Start as of December 5, 2003, the Reorganized NRG post Fresh Start balance sheet, statement of operations and statement of cash flows have not been prepared on a consistent basis with the Predecessor Companys financial statements and are therefore not comparable in certain respects to the financial statements prior to the application of Fresh Start. A black line has been drawn on the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements to separate and distinguish between Reorganized NRG and the Predecessor Company. The effects of the reorganization and Fresh Start on our balance sheet as of December 5, 2003, were as follows (in thousands): Predecessor Reorganized Company Debt Discharge NRG December 5, and Exchange December 6, 2003 of Stock Fresh Start Adjustments Consolidation 2003 (In thousands) Current Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 409,249 $ (1,728 )(B) $ $ $ 1,692 (T) $ 409,213 Restricted cash 544,387 1,732 (B) 1,932 (T) 548,051 Accounts receivable trade 233,051 640,000 (A) (2 )(B) 3,627 (J) 1,177 (T) 877,853 Accounts receivable affiliates 41,272 806 (B) (42,078 )(J) Current portion of notes receivable 66,628 66,628 Inventory 252,018 (26,618 )(K) (11,004 )(L) 214,396 Derivative instruments valuation 161 161 Prepayments and other current assets 166,754 (25,855 )(B) (7,150 )(M) 85,873 (J) 1,047 (T) 220,669 Current assets discontinued operations 4,764 (714 )(K) 1,629 (J) 5,679 Total Current Assets 1,718,284 614,149 (33,678 ) 38,047 5,848 2,342,650 Property, Plant and Equipment Net property, plant and equipment 5,883,944 (1,392,481 )(I) (132,128 )(J) 46,652 (T) 4,405,987 Other Assets Equity investments in affiliates 964,317 (216,029 )(C) 14 (J) (6,880 )(T) 741,422 Notes receivable, less current portion affiliates 164,987 (39,336 )(P) 125,651 Notes receivable, less current portion 752,847 (155,477 )(D) 77,862 (P) (301 )(T) 674,931 Decommissioning fund investments 4,787 4,787 Intangible assets, net 71,696 437,860 (O) (22,829 )(I) 486,727 Debt issuance cost, net 76,256 (76,256 )(P) Derivative instruments valuation 66,442 66,442 71 Table of Contents Predecessor Reorganized Company Debt Discharge NRG December 5, and Exchange December 6, 2003 of Stock Fresh Start Adjustments Consolidation 2003 (In thousands) Other assets, net 24,347 (133 )(P) 98,857 (J) 2,170 (T) 125,241 Non current assets discontinued operations 161,729 276 (P) (J) 162,005 Total Other Assets 2,287,408 (155,477 ) 184,244 76,042 (5,011 ) 2,387,206 Total Assets $ 9,889,636 $ 458,672 $ (1,241,915 ) $ (18,039 ) $ 47,489 $ 9,135,843 Current Liabilities Current portion of long term debt $ 1,538,866 $ (155,477 )(D) $ (120,934 )(P) $ 1,307,249 (Q) $ 613 (T) $ 2,570,317 Accounts payable trade 329,135 (101,632 )(E) (903 )(N) 5,499 (J) 232,099 Accounts payable affiliate 24,525 (2,308 )(B) (5,205 )(N) 2,995 (J) 36 (T) 20,043 Income taxes payable 19,303 (4,571 )(M) 4,255 (J) 18,987 Accrued property, sales and other taxes 32,965 (5,999 )(B) 3,556 (J) 30,522 Accrued salaries, benefits and related costs 14,337 2,377 (J) 5 (T) 16,719 Accrued interest 86,332 (2,464 )(B) 1,632 (J) 121 (T) 85,621 Derivative instruments valuation 95 95 Other current liabilities 141,542 1,260,057 (F) 8,233 (O) (10,628 )(J) 413 (T) 1,399,617 Current liabilities discontinued operations 3,518 (104 )(J) 6 (J) 3,420 Total Current Liabilities 2,190,618 998,176 (129,483 ) 1,316,941 1,188 4,377,440 Other Liabilities Long term debt 1,194,097 10,000 (G) (33,256 )(P) 303 (J) 42,060 (T) 1,213,204 Deferred income taxes 163,234 (31,087 )(M) (18,945 )(J) 113,202 Postretirement and other benefit obligations 45,181 (1,118 )(B) 64,067 (R) (2,838 )(J) 105,292 Derivative instrument valuation 53,082 102,627 (J) 155,709 Other long term obligations 152,068 763 (B) 518,085 (O) (99,060 )(J) 571,856 Non current liabilities discontinued operations 158,225 158,225 Total liabilities not subject to compromise 3,956,505 1,007,821 388,326 1,299,028 43,248 6,694,928 Total liabilities subject to compromise 7,658,071 (6,278,547 )(H) (1,367 )(J) (1,378,157 )(Q) Total liabilities 11,614,576 (5,270,726 ) 386,959 (79,129 ) 43,248 6,694,928 Minority interest 32,674 4,241 (T) 36,915 Commitments and Contingencies Class A Common stock; $.01 par value; 100 shares authorized in 2002; 3 shares issued and outstanding at December 31 2002 1 (1 )(S) Common stock; $.01 par value; 100 authorized in 2002; 1 share issued and outstanding at December 31, 2002 72 Table of Contents Predecessor Reorganized Company Debt Discharge NRG December 5, and Exchange December 6, 2003 of Stock Fresh Start Adjustments Consolidation 2003 (In thousands) Common stock; $.01 par value; 500,000,000 authorized in 2003; 100,000,000 shares issued and outstanding at December 6, 2003 1,000 (H) 1,000 Additional paid in capital 2,227,691 2,403,000 (H) (2,227,691 )(S) 2,403,000 Retained (deficit) earnings (3,986,739 ) 3,924,215 (S) 62,524 (S) Accumulated other comprehensive loss 1,433 (1,433 )(S) Total Stockholders Equity/ (Deficit) (1,757,614 ) 2,403,999 1,696,524 61,091 2,404,000 Total Liabilities and Stockholders Equity/ (Deficit) $ 9,889,636 $ (2,866,727 ) $ 2,083,483 $ (18,038 ) $ 47,489 $ 9,135,843 (A) Represents a $640.0 million receivable from Xcel Energy that relates to the Xcel Energy Settlement Agreement. $288.0 million was paid on February 20, 2004 in cash and $352.0 million will be paid on April 30, 2004.

These allocations were based on valuations obtained from independent appraisers. (J) Adoption of Fresh Start Reporting and reinstatement of miscellaneous liabilities subject to compromise. 73 Table of Contents (K) Accounting policy change upon adoption of fresh start reporting. Consumables are no longer included as inventory and are expensed as incurred. (L) Accounting policy change upon adoption of fresh start reporting. Capital spares were reclassified from inventory to Property Plant and Equipment.

(N) Adjust assets and liabilities to reflect managements estimate, with the assistance of independent specialists, of the fair value. (O) Reflects managements estimate, with the assistance of independent appraisers, of the fair value of power purchase agreements and SO2 emission credits. Management identified certain power purchase agreements that were either significantly valuable or significantly burdensome as compared to our market expectations. The predecessor goodwill and intangibles were written off. Our guarantees were reviewed for the requirement to recognize a liability at inception. As a result, we recorded a $15.0 million liability. In addition, our Asset Retirement Obligation or ARO was revalued. (In millions) SO 2 emission credits $ 373.5 Valuable contracts 113.2 Predecessor intangible (48.9 ) Total intangible $ 437.8 Burdensome contracts $ 15.1 Other valuations adjustments (6.9 ) Total other current liabilities $ 8.2 Burdensome contracts $ 493.5 Other valuations adjustments 24.6 Total other long term obligations $ 518.1 (P) Reflects managements estimate, based on current market interest rates as of December 5, 2003, of the fair value of notes receivable, notes payable and other debt instruments. (Q) Reclassification of subject to compromise liabilities due to emergence from bankruptcy, consists primarily of the debt held at our Northeast and South Central subsidiaries of $1.3 billion. The remaining amounts were reclassified to current liabilities. (R) Adjustment to post retirement and other benefit obligations in order to reflect the accumulated benefit obligation liability based on independent actuarial reports. The pension and welfare plans were assumed from Xcel Energy without the transfer of assets. (S) Reflects the cancellation of the Predecessor Companys common stock and the elimination of the retained deficit and the accumulated other comprehensive loss. (T) As required by SOP 90 7, we have adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, or FIN 46, as of the adoption of Fresh Start. The adoption of FIN 46 resulted in the consolidation of Northbrook New York, LLC and Northbrook Energy, LLC. APB No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, requires us to effectively push down the effects of Fresh Start reporting to our unconsolidated equity method investments and to recognize an adjustment to our share of the earnings or losses of an investee as if the investee were a consolidated subsidiary. As a result of pushing down the impact of Fresh Start to our West Coast Power affiliate, we determined that a contract based intangible asset with a one year remaining life, consisting of the value of West Coast Powers California Department of Water Resources energy sales contract, must be established and recognized as a basis adjustment to our share of the future earnings generated by West Coast 74 Table of Contents Power. This adjustment will reduce our equity earnings in the amount of approximately $10.4 million per month until the contract expires in December 2004. Liquidity and Capital Resources Reorganized Capital Structure In connection with the consummation of the NRG plan of reorganization, on December 5, 2003 all shares of our old common stock were canceled and 100,000,000 shares of new common stock of NRG Energy were distributed pursuant to such plan to the holders of certain classes of claims. A certain number of shares of common stock was issued for distribution to holders of disputed claims as such claims are resolved or settled. In the event our disputed claims reserve is inadequate, it is possible we would have to issue additional shares of our common stock to satisfy such pre petition claims or contribute additional cash proceeds. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings Disputed Claims Reserve. Our authorized capital stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of NRG Energy common stock and 10,000,000 shares of Serial Preferred Stock. Further, a total of 4,000,000 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 4% of our outstanding common stock, are available for issuance under our long term incentive plan. In addition to our issuance of new common stock, on December 23, 2003, we completed a note offering consisting of $1.25 billion of 8% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2013, or the Second Priority Notes, and we entered into a new credit facility consisting of a $950.0 million term loan facility, a $250.0 million funded letter of credit facility and a $250.0 million revolving credit facility. In January of 2004, we completed a supplementary note offering whereby we issued an additional $475.0 million of the Second Priority Notes at a premium and used the proceeds to repay a portion of the $950.0 million term loan. As of March 1, 2004, we had $1.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of Second Priority Notes outstanding, $446.5 million principal amount outstanding under the term loan and $147.5 million remains available under the funded letter of credit facility. As of March 1, 2004, we had not drawn down on our revolving credit facility. Finally, in connection with the consummation of the NRG plan of reorganization, we issued to Xcel Energy a $10.0 million non amortizing promissory note, which will accrue interest at a rate of 3% per annum and mature 2.5 years after the effective date of the NRG plan of reorganization. As part of the NRG plan of reorganization, we eliminated approximately $5.2 billion of corporate level bank and bond debt and approximately $1.3 billion of additional claims and disputes through our distribution of new common stock and $1.04 billion in cash among our unsecured creditors. In addition to the debt reduction associated with the restructuring, we used the proceeds of the recent note offering and borrowings under the New Credit Facility to retire approximately $1.7 billion of project level debt. For additional information on our short term and long term borrowing arrangements, see Item 15 Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historical Cash Flows Predecessor Company Historically, we have obtained cash from operations, issuance of debt and equity securities, borrowings under credit facilities, capital contributions from Xcel Energy, reimbursement by Xcel Energy of tax benefits pursuant to a tax sharing agreement and proceeds from non recourse project financings. We used these funds to finance operations, service debt obligations, fund the acquisition, development and construction of generation facilities, finance capital expenditures and meet other cash and liquidity needs. 75 Table of Contents Reorganized NRG We have obtained cash from operations, Xcel Energys contribution net of distributions to creditors, proceeds from the sale of certain assets and borrowings under our Second Priority Notes and New Credit Facility. Predecessor Company Reorganized NRG For the Period For the Period Year Ended December 31, January 1 December 6 December 5, December 31, 2001 2002 2003 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided (used) by operating activities $ 276,014 $ 430,043 $ 238,508 $ (588,875 ) Net cash (used) provided by investing activities (4,335,641 ) (1,681,467 ) (185,679 ) 363,372 Net cash provided (used) by financing activities 4,153,546 1,449,330 (29,944 ) 393,273 Net Cash Provided (Used) By Operating Activities Predecessor Company Net cash provided by operating activities increased during 2002 compared with 2001, primarily due to our efforts to conserve cash by deferring the payment of interest and managing our cash flows more closely. As a result, we increased accounts payable and accrued interest balances and reduced inventory levels. For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 net cash provided by operating activities was $238.5 million. Operating activities consisted of a net loss before Fresh Start adjustments of $1.1 billion, offset by non cash charges of $567.5 million and cash provided by working capital of $800.1 million. The non cash charges consisted primarily of the write down of our investment in Loy Yang, asset impairments and legal settlement charges. The favorable change in working capital was primarily due to reduced cash expenditures throughout the bankruptcy period resulting in increased accounts payable. Reorganized NRG For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 cash used by operating activities was $588.9 million. This was primarily a result of payments made to creditors upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Net Cash Provided (Used) By Investing Activities Predecessor Company Net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2002, compared with 2001, primarily as a result of the termination of our acquisition program due to our financial difficulties and the receipt of cash upon the sale of assets during 2002. For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 cash used in investing activities $185.7 million. This was primarily a result of capital expenditures and an increase in restricted cash, offset by cash proceeds received upon the sale of investments. Reorganized NRG For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 cash provided by investing activities was $363.4 million. In connection with the refinancing transaction, approximately $375.3 million of restricted cash was released upon payment of the Northeast Generating and South Central Generating note. This increase was offset by funds used for capital expenditures and investments in projects. 76 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided (Used) By Financing Activities Predecessor Company Net cash provided by financing activities decreased during 2002 compared to 2001 due to constraints on our ability to access the capital markets and the cancellation and termination of construction projects reducing the need for capital. For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 cash used by financing activities was $29.9 million, which consisted primarily of principal payments offset by the issuance of additional debt. Reorganized NRG For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 cash provided by financing activities was $393.3 million. We entered into refinancing transactions on December 23, 2003, where we issued $1.25 billion of Second Priority Notes and entered into the New Credit Facility, which consisted of a $950.0 million senior secured term loan facility and a $250.0 million funded letter of credit facility. Upon completion of the refinancing transactions, we repaid the Northeast Generating and South Central Generating notes and the Mid Atlantic Generating obligations. Sources of Funds The principal sources of liquidity for our future operations, capital expenditures, facility closures and project restructurings are expected to be: (i) existing cash on hand and cash flows from operations, (ii) Xcel Energys contribution net of distributions to creditors, (iii) proceeds from the sale of certain assets and businesses and (iv) borrowings under our New Credit Facility, including up to $250.0 million of available borrowings under our new revolving credit facility and up to $250.0 million of a pre funded letter of credit facility. Additionally, there are approximately $89.5 million of undrawn letters of credit under the pre petition ANZ LC Facility. The ANZ LC Facility is supported by a cash funded claim reserve to support any letters of credit drawn prior to their expiration. Capacity under the ANZ LC facility will be reduced as the underlying LCs expire or are terminated. All of the LCs will expire or be terminated by the end of 2004, at which time the ANZ LC facility will no longer exist. As a result of our emergence from bankruptcy, all of our then existing securities, including our old common stock and various issuances of senior notes, were cancelled and approximately $5.2 billion of our existing debt and approximately $1.3 billion of additional claims and disputes were eliminated for a combination of equity and up to $1.04 billion in cash. On December 23, 2003, we entered into a bank facility for up to $1.45 billion, or the New Credit Facility, which included a $950.0 million, six and a half year senior secured term loan, a $250.0 million funded letter of credit facility, and a four year $250.0 million revolving line of credit, or the revolving credit facility. Portions of the revolving credit facility are available as a swing line facility and as a revolving letter of credit sub facility. As of December 31, 2003, the corporate revolver was undrawn. Also on December 23, 2003, we issued $1.25 billion in 8% second priority, senior secured notes, or the Second Priority Notes, due and payable on December 15, 2013. Upon completion of the refinancing transactions, we, among other things: (i) repaid the Northeast Generating LLC Notes, or Northeast Notes, the South Central Generating LLC Notes, or South Central Notes, and the Mid Atlantic Generating LLC Obligations; (ii) paid a settlement amount associated with the repayment of the Northeast Notes and the South Central Notes; (iii) paid $500.0 million in lieu of 10% NRG Energy senior notes to former unsecured creditors pursuant to the NRG plan of reorganization, the POR Notes, (see the discussion of Senior Securities under Item 15 Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) ; (iv) pre funded a letter of credit sub facility under the New Credit Facility in the amount of $250.0 million; and (v) paid fees and expenses related to the offering of notes and the New Credit Facility in the amount of $74.8 million. 77 Table of Contents On January 28, 2004, we issued an additional $475.0 million of the Second Priority Notes, obtaining net proceeds of $501.8 million. With proceeds from this issuance and other funds, we subsequently 1) repaid $503.5 million of the term loan under the New Credit Facility, reducing the principal outstanding from $950.0 million to $446.5 million, 2) made a prepayment premium payment of $15.1 million, and 3) repaid accrued but unpaid interest on the prepayment amount, totaling $0.4 million. On February 25, 2004, we received from our term loan lenders a waiver under the New Credit Facility waiving our obligation to enter into a hedge arrangement on a notional value of $500.0 million, as required by the credit agreement. Cash Flows. Our operating cash flows are expected to be impacted by, among other things: (i) spark spreads generally; (ii) commodity prices (including demand for natural gas, coal, oil and electricity); (iii) the cost of ordinary course operations and maintenance expenses; (iv) planned and unplanned outages; (v) contraction of terms by trade creditors; (vi) cash requirements for closure and restructuring of certain facilities; (vii) restrictions in the declaration or payments of dividends or similar distributions from our subsidiaries; and (viii) the timing and nature of asset sales. A principal component of the NRG plan of reorganization is a settlement with Xcel Energy in which Xcel Energy agreed to make a contribution to us consisting of cash (and, under certain circumstances, its common stock) in an aggregate amount of up to $640.0 million to be paid in three separate installments. Xcel Energy contributed $288.0 million on February 20, 2004. We anticipate receiving an additional installment of up to $352.0 million in cash on April 30, 2004. We will distribute $515.0 million of cash we receive from Xcel Energy to our creditors. In the event we achieve certain liquidity measures in September 2004, an additional $25.0 million may be distributed to creditors, and we may use $100.0 million for any purpose, subject to any restrictions contained in the indenture or the New Credit Facility. Asset Sales. We received $229.3 million and $196.2 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of certain assets and businesses in the fiscal years ended 2002 and 2003, respectively. The New Credit Facility and the indenture governing the notes place restrictions on the use of any proceeds we may receive from certain asset sales in the future. Letter of Credit Sub facility and Revolving Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility includes a letter of credit sub facility in the amount of $250.0 million. As of December 31, 2003, we had issued $1.7 million in letters of credit under this facility. The New Credit Facility also includes a revolving credit facility in the amount of $250.0 million to be used for general corporate purposes. On December 31, 2003 we had not yet drawn on our revolving credit facility. For additional information regarding our debt see Item 15 Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Uses of Funds Our requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating our facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) PMI activities; (ii) capital expenditures; and (iii) project finance requirements for cash collateral. PMI. PMI activities comprise the single largest requirement for liquidity and capital resources. PMI liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posting requirements with counterparties; (ii) establishment of trading relationships; (iii) disbursement and receipt timing (i.e., buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); and (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions. For 2004, we believe that approximately $265 million to $360 million may be required for PMI to meet potential margin requirements and to cover prepayments and fuel inventory builds. Estimates for liquidity requirements are highly dependent on our hedging activity and then current market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, our estimates are dependent on credit terms with third parties. We do not assume that we will be provided with unsecured credit from third parties in budgeting our working capital requirements. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion for the year ended 2002, $113.5 million for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and $10.6 million for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Capital expenditures in 2003 relate primarily to operations and maintenance of 78 Table of Contents our existing generating facilities whereas capital expenditures in 2002 related primarily to new plant construction. We anticipate that our 2004 capital expenditures will be approximately $113.8 million and will relate primarily to the operation and maintenance of our existing generating facilities. Project Finance Requirements. We are a holding company and conduct our operations through subsidiaries. Historically, we have utilized non recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct our power plants and related assets. Consistent with our strategy, we may seek, where available on commercially reasonable terms, non recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that our affiliates or we may develop, construct or acquire. Non recourse borrowings are substantially non recourse to other subsidiaries, affiliates and us, and are generally secured by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of the related project subsidiary or affiliate. Some of these project financings require us to post collateral in the form of cash or an acceptable letter of credit.

Events may have occurred since December 31, 2003 that would allow such debt to be paid on a normal amortizing schedule. Prepayments, or additional borrowing under certain facilities, since December 31, 2003 are not reflected. See Item 15 Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on events that may affect debt payment schedules. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to our subsidiaries, the inability of any of our subsidiaries that are under construction or that have near term debt payment obligations to obtain non recourse project financing may result in such subsidiarys insolvency and the loss of our investment in such subsidiary. Additionally, the loss of a significant customer at any of our subsidiaries may result in the need to restructure the non recourse project financing at that subsidiary, and the inability to successfully complete a restructuring of the non recourse project financing may result in a loss of our investment in such subsidiary. Certain of our projects are subject to restrictions regarding the movement of cash. For additional information see Item 15 Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity Estimates For 2004, we anticipate utilizing all of our $250.0 million letter of credit sub facility. In addition, we believe that approximately $265.0 million to $360.0 million of cash may be required for PMI to meet its potential margin requirements and to cover prepayments and fuel inventory builds. As part of our refinancing transactions, we have established a $250.0 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility was established to satisfy short term working capital requirements, which may arise from time to time. It is not our current intention to draw funds under the revolving credit facility. Other Liquidity Matters We maintain cash deposits in order to assure the continuation of vendor trade terms. As of December 31, 2003, the total amount of cash deposits maintained for these purposes was approximately $48.3 million. We expect our capital requirements to be met with existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, borrowings under our Second Priority Notes and New Credit Facility, and asset sales. We believe that our current level of cash availability and asset sales, along with our future anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet the existing operational and collateral needs of our business for the next 12 months. Subject to restrictions in our Second Priority Notes and our New Credit Facility, if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell assets, obtain additional credit facilities or other financings and or issue additional equity or convertible instruments. We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. 80 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Items As of December 31, 2003, we do not have any significant relationships with structured finance or special purpose entities that provide liquidity, financing or incremental market risk or credit risk. We have numerous investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy related entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as disclosed in Item 15 Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our pro rata share of non recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $967.7 million as of December 31, 2003. In the normal course of business we may be asked to loan funds to these entities on both a long and short term basis. Such transactions are generally accounted for as accounts payables and receivables to/from affiliates and notes payables/receivables to/from affiliates and if appropriate, bear market based interest rates. See Item 15 Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding amounts accounted for as notes receivable affiliates. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments We have a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to our capital expenditure programs. The following is a summarized table of contractual obligations. See additional discussion in Item 15 Notes 17, 24 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Since we formerly were an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy, there were certain related party transactions that took place in the normal 81 Table of Contents course of business. For additional information regarding our related party transactions, see Item 15 Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Derivative Instruments We may enter into long term power sales contracts, long term gas purchase contracts and other energy related commodities financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices, hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities and protect fuel inventories. The tables below disclose the trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; identify changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2003 based on whether fair values are determined by quoted market prices or more subjective means; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2003.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed. On an ongoing basis, we, evaluate our estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable. In any case, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table identifies certain of the significant accounting policies listed in Item 15 Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table also identifies the judgments required, uncertainties involved in the application of each and estimates that may have a material impact on our results of operations and statement of financial position.These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. We identify our most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting Policy Judgments/ Uncertainties Affecting Application Fresh Start Reporting The determination of the enterprise value and the allocation to the underlying assets and liabilities are based on a number of estimates and assumptions, which are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies Determination of enterprise value Determination of Fresh Start date Consolidation of entities remaining in bankruptcy Valuation of emission credit allowances and power sales contracts Valuation of debt instruments Valuation of equity investments Capitalization Practices/ Purchase Accounting Determination of beginning and ending of capitalization periods Allocation of purchase prices to identified assets 83 Table of Contents Accounting Policy Judgments/ Uncertainties Affecting Application Asset Valuation and Impairment Recoverability of investment through future operations Regulatory and political environments and requirements Estimated useful lives of assets Environmental obligations and operational limitations Estimates of future cash flows Estimates of fair value (fresh start) Judgment about triggering events Inventory Valuation of inventory balances Foreign Currency Translation Recognition of changes in foreign currencies.

Fresh Start Reporting In connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted Fresh Start in accordance with the requirements of SOP 90 7. The application of SOP 90 7 resulted in the creation of a new reporting entity. Under Fresh Start, the reorganization value of our company was allocated among our assets and liabilities on a basis substantially consistent with purchase accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations. The bankruptcy court in its confirmation order approved our Plan of reorganization on November 24, 2003. Under the requirements of SOP 90 7, the Fresh Start date is determined to be the confirmation date unless significant uncertainties exist regarding the effectiveness of the bankruptcy order. Our Plan of reorganization required completion of the Xcel Energy settlement agreement prior to emergence from bankruptcy. We believe this settlement agreement was a significant contingency and thus delayed the Fresh Start date until the Xcel Energy settlement agreement was finalized on December 5, 2003. Under the requirements of Fresh Start, we have adjusted our assets and liabilities, other than deferred income taxes, to their estimated fair values as of December 5, 2003. As a result of marking our assets and liabilities to their estimated fair values, we determined that there was no excess reorganization value to recognize as an intangible asset. Deferred taxes were determined in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The net effect of all Fresh Start adjustments resulted in a gain of $3.9 billion, which is reflected in the Predecessor Companys results for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. The application of the Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90 7 created a new reporting entity having no retained earnings or accumulated deficit. As part of the bankruptcy process we engaged an independent financial advisor to assist in the determination of the fair value of our reorganized enterprise value. The fair value calculation was based on managements forecast of our core assets. Managements forecast relied on forward market prices obtained from a third party consulting firm. A discounted cash flow calculation was used to develop the enterprise value of Reorganized NRG, determined in part by calculating the weighted average cost of capital of the Reorganized NRG. The Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, valuation methodology equates the value of an asset or business to the present value of expected future economic benefits to be generated by that asset or business. The DCF methodology is a forward looking approach that discounts all expected future economic benefits by a theoretical or observed discount rate determined by calculating the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, of Reorganized NRG. The enterprise calculation was based on managements forecast of our core assets. Managements forecast relied on forward market prices obtained from a third party consulting firm. For purposes of our Disclosure statement, the independent financial advisor estimated our reorganization enterprise value of our ongoing projects to range from $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion, less project level debt, and net of cash. Certain other adjustments were made to reflect the values of assets held for sale, excess cash and net of the Xcel Settlement and collateral requirements. These adjustments resulted in a reorganized NRG value, net of project debt, of between $3.1 billion and $3.5 billion. Additional adjustments were made to reflect cash payments expected as part of the implementation of the Plan of Reorganization, resulting in a final range of equity values of between $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion. In constructing our Fresh Start balance sheet upon our emergence from bankruptcy we used a reorganization equity value of approximately $2.4 billion, as we believe this value to be the best indication of the value of the ownership distributed to the new equity owners. Our reorganization value of approximately $9.1 billion was determined by adding our reorganized equity value of $2.4 billion, $3.7 billion of interest bearing debt and our other liabilities of $3.0 billion. The reorganization value represents the fair value of an entity before liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after restructuring. This value is consistent with the voting creditors and Courts approval of the Plan of Reorganization. 85 Table of Contents A separate plan of reorganization was filed for our Northeast Generating and South Central Generating entities that was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on November 25, 2003, and became effective on December 23, 2003, when the final conditions of the plan were completed. In connection with Fresh Start on December 5, 2003, we have accounted for these entities as if they had emerged from bankruptcy at the same time that we emerged as we believe that we continued to maintain control over the Northeast Generating and South Central Generating facilities through out the bankruptcy process. Due to the adoption of Fresh Start upon our emergence from bankruptcy, the Reorganized NRGs post fresh start balance sheet, statement of operations and statement of cash flows have not been prepared on a consistent basis with the Predecessor Companys financial statements and are therefore not comparable in certain respects to the financial statements prior to the application of Fresh Start. Capitalization Practices and Purchase Accounting Predecessor Company For those assets that were being constructed by us, the carrying value reflects the application of our property, plant and equipment policies which incorporate estimates, assumptions and judgments by management relative to the capitalized costs and useful lives of our generating facilities. Interest incurred on funds borrowed to finance projects expected to require more than three months to complete is capitalized. Capitalization of interest is discontinued when the asset under construction is ready for our intended use or when construction is terminated. An insignificant amount of interest was capitalized during 2003. Development costs and capitalized project costs include third party professional services, permits and other costs that are incurred incidental to a particular project. Such costs are expensed as incurred until an acquisition agreement or letter of intent is signed, and our board of directors has approved the project. Additional costs incurred after this point are capitalized. Reorganized NRG In connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted Fresh Start in accordance with the requirements of SOP 90 7. The application of SOP 90 7 resulted in the creation of a new reporting entity. Under Fresh Start, the reorganization value of our company was allocated to our assets and liabilities on a basis substantially consistent with purchase accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141. We engaged a valuation specialist to help us determine the fair value of our fixed assets. The valuations were based on forecast power prices and operating costs determined by us. The valuation specialist also determined the estimated remaining useful lives of our fixed assets. The capitalization policy will be consistent with the predecessor company policy. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We evaluate property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to us. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, net income from continuing operations was reduced by $228.9 million due to asset impairments. Asset impairment evaluations are by nature highly subjective. Revenue Recognition and Uncollectible Receivables We are primarily an electric generation company, operating a portfolio of majority owned electric generating plants and certain plants in which our ownership is 50% or less which are accounted for under the 86 Table of Contents equity method of accounting. We also produce thermal energy for sale to customers. Both physical and financial transactions are entered into to optimize the financial performance of our generating facilities. Electric energy revenue is recognized upon transmission to the customer. In certain markets, which are operated/ controlled by an independent system operator and in which we have entered into a netting agreement with the ISO, which results in our receiving a netted invoice, we have recorded purchased energy as an offset against revenues received upon the sale of such energy. Capacity and ancillary revenue is recognized when contractually earned. Revenues from operations and maintenance services are recognized when the services are performed. We continually assess the collectibility of our receivables, and in the event we believe a receivable to be uncollectible, an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded or, in the event of a contractual dispute, the receivable and corresponding revenue may be considered unlikely of recovery and not recorded in the financial statements until management is satisfied that it will be collected. Derivative Financial Instruments In January 2001, we adopted FAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, or SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149. SFAS No. 133 requires us to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. In some cases hedge accounting may apply. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are a) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure, b) whether or not the overall risk is being reduced and c) if there is correlation between the value of the derivative instrument and the underlying obligation. Formal documentation of the hedging relationship, the nature of the underlying risk, the risk management objective, and the means by which effectiveness will be assessed is created at the inception of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of non hedge derivatives are immediately recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged assets, liabilities and firm commitments or for forecasted transactions, deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or OCI, until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings. We primarily account for derivatives under SFAS No. 133 such as long term power sales contracts, long term gas purchase contracts and other energy related commodities and financial instruments used to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices, hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities and to protect investments in fuel inventories. SFAS No. 133 also applies to interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange rate contracts. The application of SFAS No. 133 results in increased volatility in earnings due to the recognition of unrealized gains and losses. In determining the fair value of these derivative/financial instruments we use estimates, various assumptions, judgment of management and when considered appropriate third party experts in determining the fair value of these derivatives. Discontinued Operations We classify our results of operations that either have been disposed of or are classified as held for sale as discontinued operations if both of the following conditions are met: (a) the operations and cash flows have been (or will be) eliminated from our ongoing operations as a result of the disposal transaction and (b) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction. Pensions The determination of our obligation and expenses for pension benefits is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions. These assumptions determined by management include the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation increases. Our actuarial consultants use assumptions for such items as retirement age. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results, which may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension obligation or expense recorded by us. 87 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, or SFAS No. 123. In accordance with SFAS Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, or SFAS No. 148, we adopted SFAS No. 123 under the prospective transition method which requires the application of the recognition provisions to all employee awards granted, modified, or settled after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied. Recent Accounting Developments As part of the provisions of SOP 90 7, we are required to adopt, for the current reporting period, all accounting guidance that is effective within a twelve month period. As a result, we have adopted all provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Historically we have used a variety of financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our international project cash flows, interest rates on our cost of borrowing and energy and energy related commodities prices. Currency Exchange Risk We expect to continue to be subject to currency risks associated with foreign denominated distributions from our international investments. In the normal course of business, we may receive distributions denominated in the Euro, Australian Dollar, British Pound, New Taiwanese Dollar and the Brazilian Real. We have historically engaged in a strategy of hedging foreign denominated cash flows through a program of matching currency inflows and outflows, and to the extent required, fixing the U.S. Dollar equivalent of net foreign denominated distributions with currency forward and swap agreements with highly credit worthy financial institutions. We would expect to enter into similar transactions in the future if management believes it to be appropriate. As of December 31, 2003, neither we, nor any of our consolidating subsidiaries, had any outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates when entering into variable rate debt obligations to fund certain power projects. Exposure to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument. Our risk management policy allows us to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations. As of December 31, 2003, we had various interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling approximately $620.5 million. If the swaps had been discontinued on December 31, 2003, we would have owed the counter parties approximately $50.1 million. Based on the investment grade rating of the counter parties, we believe that our exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by the counter parties to our hedging contracts is insignificant. We have both long and short term debt instruments that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2003, a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on our variable rate debt would impact net income by approximately $14.5 million. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of our fixed rate debt was $1.8 billion, compared with the carrying amount of $1.8 billion. We estimate that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixed rate debt to $1.9 billion, or an increase of $119.2 million. 88 Table of Contents Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to commodity price variability in electricity. Commodity price risk also impacts emission allowances, natural gas, oil and coal, which are required to generate power. To manage earnings volatility associated with these commodity price risks, we enter into financial instruments, which may take the form of fixed price, floating price or indexed sales or purchases, and options, such as puts, calls, basis transactions and swaps. We utilize an un diversified Value at Risk, or VAR, model to estimate a maximum potential loss in the fair value of our commodity portfolio including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions. The key assumptions for our VAR model include (1) a lognormal distribution of price returns (2) three day holding period and (3) a 95% confidence interval. The volatility estimate is based on the implied volatility for at the money call options. This model encompasses the following generating regions: ENTERGY, NEPOOL, NYPP, PJM, WSCC and MAIN. The estimated maximum potential three day loss in fair value of our commodity portfolio, calculated using the VAR model is as follows: (In millions) Year end December 31, 2003 $ 115.7 Average 179.9 High 282.9 Low 106.9 Year end December 31, 2002 118.6 Average 76.2 High 124.4 Low 42.0 Year end December 31, 2001 71.7 Average 78.8 High 126.6 Low 58.6 We have risk management policies in place to measure and limit market and credit risk associated with our power marketing activities. These policies do not permit speculative or directional trading. An independent department within our finance organization is responsible for the enforcement of such policies. We are currently in the process of reviewing and revising these policies to reflect changes in best practices and industry. Credit Risk We are exposed to credit risk in our risk management activities. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a counter party of its contractual obligations. We actively manage our counter party credit risk. We have an established credit policy in place to minimize overall credit risk. Important elements of this policy include ongoing financial reviews of all counter parties, established credit limits, as well as monitoring, managing and mitigating credit exposure. 89 Table of Contents
