Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG Energy, the Company, we, our, or us is a wholesale power generation company, primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of power generation facilities, the transacting in and trading of fuel and transportation services and the marketing and trading of energy, capacity and related products in the United States and internationally. We have a diverse portfolio of electric generation facilities in terms of geography, fuel type and dispatch levels. Our principal domestic generation assets consist of a diversified mix of natural gas , coal and oil fired facilities, representing approximately 40%, 31% and 29% of our total domestic generation capacity, respectively. In addition, 23% of our domestic generating facilities have dual or multiple fuel capacity, which allows plants to dispatch with the lowest cost fuel option. Our two principal objectives are to maximize the operating performance of our entire portfolio, and to protect and enhance the market value of our physical and contractual assets through the execution of asset based risk management, marketing and trading strategies within well defined risk and liquidity guidelines. We aggregate the assets in our core regions into integrated businesses to serve the requirements of the load serving entities in our core markets. Our business involves the reinvestment of capital in our existing assets for reasons of repowering, expansion, environmental remediation, operating efficiency, reliability programs, greater fuel optionality, greater merit order diversity, enhanced portfolio effect or for alternative use, among other reasons. Our business also may involve acquisitions intended to complement the asset portfolios in our core regions, and from time to time we may also consider and undertake other merger and acquisition transactions that are consistent with our strategy. 51 Table of Contents The wholesale energy industry entered a prolonged slump in 2001, from which it is only beginning to emerge. We expect that generally weak market conditions will continue for the foreseeable future in many U.S. markets. We further expect that the merchant power industry will continue to see corporate restructuring, debt restructuring, and consolidation over the coming years. Asset Sales. We have substantially completed our divestment of major non core assets; however, as part of our strategy, we plan to continue the selective divestment of certain non core assets. We have no current plans to market actively any of our core assets, although our intention to maximize over time the value of all of our assets could lead to additional assets sales. Discontinued Operations. We have classified certain business operations, and gains/losses recognized on sale, as discontinued operations for projects that were sold or have met the required criteria for such classification pending final disposition. Accounting regulations require that continuing operations be reported separately in the income statement from discontinued operations, and that any gain or loss on the disposition of any such business be reported along with the operating results of such business. Assets classified as discontinued operations on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 consist of the McClain project. All other projects have been sold as of December 31, 2004. Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm; Audit Committee. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP served as our independent auditors from 1995 through 2003. On May 3, 2004, we announced that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP had decided not to stand for re election as our independent auditor for the year ended December 31, 2004. On May 24, 2004 the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors appointed KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm going forward, and on August 4, 2004 our stockholders ratified the appointment. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has consented to the inclusion of their reports for the periods January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003 and December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003 and for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company intends to continue to request the consent of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in future filings with the SEC when deemed necessary. Fresh Start Reporting. In connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted Fresh Start Reporting on December 5, 2003, in accordance with the requirements of Statement of Position 90 7, Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code, or SOP 90 7. The application of SOP 90 7 resulted in the creation of a new reporting entity. Under Fresh Start, our reorganization value was allocated to our assets and liabilities on a basis substantially consistent with purchase accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, our assets recorded values were adjusted to reflect their estimated fair values upon adoption of Fresh Start. Any portion of the reorganization value not attributable to specific assets is an indefinite lived intangible asset referred to as reorganization value in excess of value of identifiable assets and reported as goodwill. We did not record any such amounts. As a result of adopting Fresh Start and emerging from bankruptcy, our historical financial information is not comparable to financial information for periods after our emergence from bankruptcy. Results of Operations Upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted the Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90 7. Accordingly, the Reorganized NRG statement of operations and statement of cash flows have not been prepared on a consistent basis with the Predecessor Companys financial statements and are not comparable in certain respects to the financial statements prior to the application of Fresh Start, therefore, the Predecessor Companys and the Reorganized NRGs amounts are discussed separately for comparison and analysis purposes, herein. 52 Table of Contents The following table shows the percent of total revenue each segment contributes to our total revenue: Reorganized NRG Predecessor Company For the Year For the Period For the Period For the Year Ended Percent of December 6 Percent of January 1 Percent of Ended Percent of December 31, Total December 31, Total December 5, Total December 31, Total Segments 2004 Revenue 2003 Revenue 2003 Revenue 2002 Revenue (In thousands) (In thousands) (In thousands) (In thousands) Wholesale Power Generation Northeast $ 1,251,153 53.0 % $ 69,191 50.0 % $ 861,452 47.9 % $ 964,196 49.7 % South Central 418,145 17.6 % 26,609 19.2 % 356,534 19.8 % 388,023 20.0 % West Coast 2,469 0.1 % (268 ) (0.2 )% 23,956 1.3 % 30,796 1.6 % Other North America 105,644 4.5 % 5,377 3.9 % 85,388 4.8 % 81,521 4.2 % Australia 181,065 7.7 % 11,947 8.6 % 151,494 8.4 % 170,761 8.8 % All Other Other International 157,220 6.7 % 13,082 9.4 % 137,384 7.6 % 108,379 5.6 % Alternative Energy 65,872 2.8 % 3,852 2.8 % 60,871 3.4 % 69,030 3.6 % Non Generation 186,425 7.9 % 9,860 7.1 % 129,063 7.2 % 135,403 7.0 % Other (6,569 ) (0.3 )% (1,160 ) (0.8 )% (7,755 ) (0.4 )% (9,816 ) (0.5 )% Total Revenue $ 2,361,424 100.0 % $ 138,490 100.0 % $ 1,798,387 100.0 % $ 1,938,293 100.0 % The following table provides operating income by segment for the year ended December 31, 2004.

These favorable results occurred despite a challenging market environment in 2004. Unseasonably mild weather, high volatility on forward markets and disappointing spot power prices summarize 2004s events. The year started with colder than normal weather arriving in January but unseasonably mild weather characterized the period from March thru December which dampened energy prices in North America. The National Oceanic Atmospheric Agency, or NOAA, has ranked the mean average temperatures over the past 110 years by season for each of the lower 48 states. The year 2004 started 53 Table of Contents with the winter being colder than normal in the east coast followed by a spring, summer and fall which were among the mildest in the last 110 years throughout most of the United States. Although mild weather in the North America market kept spot market on peak power prices low throughout most of the year, relatively high gas and oil prices kept spark spreads on coal based assets positive. The overall perception that there would be significant production losses due to Hurricane Ivan ignited a strong pre heating season rally in natural gas futures during the early fourth quarter. While power prices tracked changes in natural gas prices, this movement was not one for one. As a result, our spark spreads on coal based generation increased dramatically with the fall 2004 changes in gas prices. During this period we sold forward 2005 power locking in these spark spreads. Forward power prices have fallen considerably from the highs set in October, and many of those forward sales, which were marked to market through earnings, significantly contributed to the $57.3 million unrealized gain recorded in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 and as more fully described in Note 16 to the financial statements. As indicated above, our 2004 results were favorably impacted by the cold weather in January. Additionally, the Northeasts income results for the year were positively impacted by the $57.3 million of unrealized gains associated with forward sale transactions supporting our Northeast assets. The majority of the unrealized gains relate to forward sales of electricity which will be realized in 2005. These gains were offset by our South Central regions results, which were negatively impacted by an unplanned outage in the fourth quarter forcing us to purchase power to meet our contract supply obligations. Impairment charges of $44.7 million negatively impacted net income; of which $26.5 million relates to the Kendall asset. Our results were also favorably impacted by the FERC approved settlement agreement between NRG Energy and Connecticut Light & Power, or CL&P, and others concerning the congestion and losses obligation associated with a prior standard offer service contract, whereby we received $38.4 million in settlement proceeds in July 2004. The 2004 results were also positively impacted by $159.8 million in equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates including $68.9 million from our interest in West Coast Power which benefited from warmer than normal temperatures during the year. During the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, we recognized net income of $11.0 million or $0.11 per share of common stock. Net income was directly attributable to a number of factors some of which are discussed below. From an overall operational perspective our facilities were profitable during this period. Our results were adversely impacted by our having to continue to satisfy the standard offer service contract that we entered into with CL&P in 2000. As a result of our inability to terminate this contract during our bankruptcy proceeding, we continued to be exposed to losses under this contract. These losses were incurred, as we were unable to satisfy the requirements of this contract at a price/cost below the contracted sales price. Upon our adoption of Fresh Start, we recorded at fair value, all assets and liabilities on our opening balance sheet and accordingly we recorded as an obligation the fair value of the CL&P contract. During the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, we recognized as revenues the entire fair value of this contract effectively offsetting the actual losses incurred under this contract. The CL&P contract terminated on December 31, 2003. Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we recorded net income of $2.8 billion. Net income for the period is directly attributable to our emerging from bankruptcy and adopting the Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90 7. Upon the confirmation of our Plan of Reorganization and our emergence from bankruptcy, we were able to remove significant amounts of long term debt and other pre petition obligations from our balance sheet. Accordingly, as part of net income, we recorded a net gain of $3.9 billion (comprised of a $4.1 billion gain from continuing operations and a $0.2 billion loss from discontinued operations) as the impact of our adopting Fresh Start in our statement of operations. $6.0 billion of this amount is directly related to the forgiveness of debt and settlement of substantial amounts of our pre petition obligations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. In addition to the removal of substantial amounts of pre petition debt and other obligations from our balance sheet, we also revalued our assets and liabilities to fair value. Accordingly, we substantially wrote down the value of our fixed assets. We recorded a net $1.6 billion charge related to the revaluation of our assets and liabilities within the Fresh Start Reporting adjustment line of our consolidated 54 Table of Contents statement of operations. In addition to our adjustments related to our emergence from bankruptcy, we also recorded substantial charges related to other items such as the settlement of certain outstanding litigation in the amount of $462.6 million, write downs and losses on the sale of equity investments of $147.1 million, advisor costs and legal fees directly attributable to our being in bankruptcy of $197.8 million and $237.6 million of other asset impairment and restructuring costs incurred prior to our filing for bankruptcy. Net income for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 was favorably impacted by our not recording interest expense on substantial amounts of corporate level debt while we were in bankruptcy and by the continued favorable results experienced by our equity investments. Revenues from Majority Owned Operations Reorganized NRG Our revenues from majority owned operations were $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 which included $1.4 billion of energy revenues, $612.3 million of capacity revenues, $175.7 million of alternative energy revenues, $20.8 million of O&M fees and $174.1 million of other revenues, which include $57.3 million of unrealized gains associated with financial sales transactions of electricity, which are marked to market, $22.4 million from ancillary service revenues and the remainder related to financial and physical gas sales and non cash contract amortization resulting from fresh start accounting and other miscellaneous revenue items. Revenues from majority owned operations for the year ended December 31, 2004, were driven primarily by our North American operations, primarily our Northeast facilities. Our wholly owned domestic Northeast power generation operations significantly contributed to our energy revenues. Our wholly owned North America assets generated approximately 29.0 million megawatt hours during the year 2004 with the Northeast region representing 45.6% of these megawatt hours. Of the total $1.4 billion in energy revenues, the Northeast region represented 62%. Our energy revenues were favorably impacted by the FERC approved settlement agreement between us and CL&P and others, whereby we received $38.4 million in settlement proceeds in July 2004. These settlement proceeds are included in the All Other segment in the energy revenue category. South Centrals energy revenues are driven by our ability to sell merchant energy, which is dependent upon available generation from our coal based Louisiana Generating company after serving our co op customer and long term customer load obligations. Since our load obligation is primarily residential load, our merchant opportunities are largely available in the off peak hours of the day. Our Australian operations were favorably impacted by strong market prices driven by gas restrictions in January, record high temperatures in February and March, and favorable foreign exchange movements. Our capacity revenues are largely driven by our Northeast and South Central facilities. Our South Central and New York City assets earned 30% and 26% of our total capacity revenues, respectively. In the Northeast, our Connecticut facilities continue to benefit from the cost based reliability must run, or RMR agreements, which were authorized by FERC as of January 17, 2004 and approved by FERC on January 27, 2005. The agreements entitle us to approximately $7.1 million of capacity revenues per month until January 1, 2006, the LICAP implementation date. In the South Central region, our long term contracts provide for capacity payments. Other North American capacity revenues were generated by our Kendall operation, which had a long term tolling agreement. During this period we also experienced a favorable impact on our revenues due to the mark to market on certain of our derivative contracts wherein we have recognized $57.3 million in unrealized gains. This gain is related to our Northeast assets and is included in Other Revenue. Also included in Other Revenue in the Northeast are the cost reimbursement funds under the RMR agreement for our Connecticut assets. Our revenues during this period include net charges of $35.3 million of non cash amortization of the fair values of various executory contracts recorded on our balance sheet upon our adoption of the Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90 7 in December 2003. Our revenues from majority owned operations were $138.5 million for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. 55 Table of Contents Predecessor Company Revenues from majority owned operations were $1.8 billion for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and include $992.6 million of energy revenues, $566.0 million of capacity revenues, $115.9 million of alternative energy, $12.9 million of O&M fees and $110.9 million of other revenues which include financial and physical gas sales, sales from our Schkopau facility and NEPOOL expense reimbursements. Revenues from majority owned operations during the period ended December 5, 2003, were driven primarily by our North American operations and to a lesser degree by our international operations, primarily Australia. Our domestic Northeast and South Central power generation operations significantly contributed to our revenues due primarily to favorable market prices resulting from strong fuel and electricity prices. Our Australian operations were favorably impacted by foreign exchange rates. During this period we also experienced an unfavorable impact on our revenues due to continued losses on our CL&P standard offer contract and the mark to market on certain of our derivatives. Cost of Majority Owned Operations Reorganized NRG Our cost of majority owned operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $1.5 billion or 63.3% of revenues from majority owned operations. Cost of majority owned operations consist of $1.008 billion of cost of energy (primarily fuel and purchased energy costs), or 42.7% of revenues from majority owned operations and $486.1 million of operating expenses, or 20.6% of revenues from majority owned operations. Operating expenses consist of $208.5 million of labor related costs, $236.7 million of operating and maintenance costs, $38.2 million of non income based taxes and $2.9 million of asset retirement obligation accretion. Cost of Energy Fuel related costs include $478.3 million in coal costs, $233.0 million in natural gas costs, $104.7 million in fuel oil costs, $38.8 million in transmission and transportation expenses, $100.4 million of purchased energy costs, $35.0 million in other costs and $17.8 million in non cash SO2 emission credit amortization resulting from Fresh Start accounting. The Northeast region consumed 50%, 64% and 92% of total coal, natural gas and oil expenditures, respectively. The South Central region, which is comprised mainly of our Louisiana base loaded coal plant, consumed 32% of our total coal expenditures. Operating Expenses Operating expenses related to continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $486.1 million or 20.6% of revenues from majority owned operations. Operating expenses include labor, normal and major maintenance costs, environmental and safety costs, utilities costs, and non income based taxes. Labor costs include regular, overtime and contract costs at our plants and totaled $208.5 million. The Northeast region, where the majority of our assets reside, represents 52% of total labor costs; Australia represents 18%, while our South Central region represents 11%. Of the total O&M costs, normal and major maintenance at our plants accounted for $176.7 million, or 36.3% of total operating costs. Maintenance costs were largely driven by planned outages across our fleet, and the low sulfur coal conversion in western New York. The Northeast region represented over half of the normal and major maintenance, with a total of $98.6 million in costs in 2004 while Australia had $38.8 million in normal and major maintenance, or 22%. Operating expenses were positively impacted by a $7 million favorable settlement with a vendor regarding auxiliary power charges. Non income based taxes totaled $38.2 million net of $34.6 million in property tax credits, primarily associated with an enterprise zone program. Cost of majority owned operations was $95.5 million, or 69.0% of revenues from majority owned operations for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Cost of energy for this period was $62.3 million or 45.0% of revenues from majority owned operations and operating expenses were $33.2 million, or 24.0% of revenues from majority owned operations. Labor during this period totaled $11.1 million. Normal and major maintenance was $12 million with 70% of the total normal and major maintenance for this time period coming from our Northeast region. 56 Table of Contents Predecessor Company Cost of majority owned operations was $1.4 billion, or 75.4% of revenues from majority owned operations for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. Cost of majority owned operations was unfavorably impacted by increased generation in the Northeast region, partially offset by a reduction in trading and hedging activity resulting from a reduction in our power marketing activities. Our international operations were impacted by an unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates and continued mark to market of the Osborne contract at Flinders resulting from lower pool prices. Depreciation and Amortization Reorganized NRG Our depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $209.3 million. Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of the allocation of our historical depreciable fixed asset costs over the remaining lives of such property. Upon adoption of Fresh Start, we were required to revalue our fixed assets to fair value and determine new remaining lives for such assets. Our fixed assets were written down substantially upon our emergence from bankruptcy. We also determined new remaining depreciable lives, which are, on average, shorter than what we had previously used primarily due to the age and condition of our fixed assets. Depreciation and amortization expense for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 was $11.8 million. Depreciation and amortization expense consists of the allocation of our newly valued basis in our fixed assets over newly determined remaining fixed asset lives. Predecessor Company Our depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing operations for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 was $218.8 million. During this period, depreciation expense was unfavorably impacted by the shortening of the depreciable lives of certain of our domestic power generation facilities located in the Northeast region and the impact of recently completed construction projects. The depreciable lives of certain of our Northeast facilities, primarily our Connecticut facilities, were shortened to reflect economic developments in that region. Certain capitalized development costs were written off in connection with the Loy Yang project resulting in increased expense. Amortization expense increased due to reducing the life of certain software costs. General, Administrative and Development Reorganized NRG Our general, administrative and development costs related to continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $211.2 million. Of this total, $111.1 million or 4.7% of revenues from majority owned operations represents our corporate costs, with the remaining $100.1 million representing costs at our plant operations. Corporate costs are primarily comprised of corporate labor, external professional support, such as legal, accounting and audit fees, and office expenses. Corporate general, administrative and development expenses were negatively impacted this year by increased legal fees, increased audit costs and increased consulting costs due to our Sarbanes Oxley testing and implementation. Plant general, administrative and development costs primarily include insurance and external consulting costs. Plant insurance costs were $40.6 million. Additionally, we recorded $11.7 million in bad debt expense related to notes receivable. General, administrative and development costs were $12.5 million, or 9.0% of revenues from continuing operations for the period December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003. These costs are primarily comprised of corporate labor, insurance and external professional support, such as legal, accounting and audit fees. 57 Table of Contents Predecessor Company Our general, administrative and development costs related to continuing operations for the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003 were $170.3 million or 9.5% of revenues from majority owned operations. These costs are primarily comprised of corporate labor, insurance and external professional support, such as legal, accounting and audit fees. Other Charges (Credits) Reorganized NRG For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded other charges of $47.4 million, which consisted of $16.2 million of corporate relocation charges, $13.4 million of reorganization credits and $44.6 million of restructuring and impairment charges. For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 we recorded $2.5 million of reorganization charges. Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, we recorded other credits of $3.2 billion, which consisted primarily of $228.9 million related to asset impairments, $462.6 million related to legal settlements, $197.8 million related to reorganization charges and $8.7 million related to restructuring charges. We also incurred a $4.1 billion credit related to Fresh Start adjustments. Other charges (credits) consist of the following: Reorganized NRG Predecessor Company For the Period For the Period Year Ended December 6 January 1 December 31, December 31, December 5, 2004 2003 2003 (In thousands) Corporate relocation charges $ 16,167 $ $ Reorganization items (13,390 ) 2,461 197,825 Impairment charges 44,661 228,896 Restructuring charges 8,679 Fresh Start adjustments (4,118,636 ) Legal settlement 462,631 Total $ 47,438 $ 2,461 $ (3,220,605 ) Corporate Relocation Charges On March 16, 2004, we announced plans to implement a new regional business strategy and structure. The new structure called for a reorganized leadership team and a corporate headquarters relocation to Princeton, New Jersey. The corporate headquarters staff were streamlined as part of the relocation, as functions were either reduced or shifted to the regions. The transition of the corporate headquarters is substantially complete. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded $16.2 million for charges related to our corporate relocation activities, primarily for employee severance and termination benefits and employee related transition costs. These charges are classified separately in our statement of operations, in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. We expect to incur an additional $7.7 million of SFAS No. 146 classified expenses in connection with corporate relocation charges for a total of $23.9 million. Of this total, relocating, recruiting and other employee related transition costs are expected to be approximately $11.9 million and have been and will continue to be expensed as incurred. These costs and cash payments are expected to be incurred through the second quarter of 2005. Severance and termination benefits of $7.2 million are expected to be incurred through the second quarter of 58 Table of Contents 2005 with cash payments being made through the fourth quarter of 2005. Building lease termination costs are expected to be $4.8 million. These costs are expected to be incurred through the first quarter of 2005 with cash payments being made through the fourth quarter of 2006. Costs not classified separately as relocation charges include rent expense of our temporary office in Princeton, construction costs of our new office and certain labor costs. All costs relating to the corporate relocation that are not classified separately as relocation charges, except for approximately $5.7 million of related capital expenditures will be expensed as incurred and included in general, administrative and development expenses. Cash expenditures for 2004, including capital expenditures, were $22.4 million. We currently estimate total costs associated with the corporate relocation to be approximately $40.0 million. We recognized a curtailment gain of $750,000 on our defined benefit pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2004, as a substantial number of our current headquarters staff left the Company in this period. Reorganization Items For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded a net credit of $13.4 million related primarily to the settlement of obligations recorded under Fresh Start. We incurred $7.4 million of professional fees associated with the bankruptcy which offset $20.8 million of credits associated with creditor settlements. For the periods December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003 and January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, we incurred $2.5 million and $197.8 million, respectively, in reorganization costs. All reorganization costs have been incurred since we filed for bankruptcy in May 2003. The following table provides the detail of the types of costs incurred. Predecessor Reorganized NRG Company For the period For the period Year Ended December 6 January 1 December 31, December 31, December 5, 2004 2003 2003 (In thousands) Reorganization items Professional fees $ 7,383 $ 2,461 $ 82,186 Deferred financing costs 55,374 Pre payment settlement 19,609 Interest earned on accumulated cash (1,059 ) Contingent equity obligation 41,715 Settlement of obligations (20,773 ) Total reorganization items $ (13,390 ) $ 2,461 $ 197,825 Impairment Charges We review the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with the guidelines of SFAS No. 144. As a result of this review, we recorded impairment charges of $44.7 million and $228.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, respectively, as shown in the table below. Of the $44.7 million total in 2004, Kendall and the Meriden turbine accounted for $26.5 million and $15.0 million, respectively. Both of these charges were based on indicative market valuations. We successfully completed the sale of Kendall in November 2004 and expect to complete the sale of the Meriden turbine in the first quarter of 2005. There were no impairment charges for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. To determine whether an asset was impaired, we compared asset carrying values to total future estimated undiscounted cash flows. Separate analyses were completed for assets or groups of assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The estimates of future cash flows included only future cash flows, net of associated cash outflows, directly associated with and expected to arise as a result of our assumed use and eventual disposition of the asset. Cash flow estimates associated with assets in service were based on the assets existing service potential. The cash 59 Table of Contents flow estimates may include probability weightings to consider possible alternative courses of action and outcomes, given the uncertainty of available information and prospective market conditions. If an asset was determined to be impaired based on the cash flow testing performed, an impairment loss was recorded to write down the asset to its fair value. Estimates of fair value were based on prices for similar assets and present value techniques. Fair values determined by similar asset prices reflect our current estimate of recoverability from expected marketing of project assets. For fair values determined by projected cash flows, the fair value represents a discounted cash flow amount over the remaining life of each project that reflects project specific assumptions for long term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs, and expected plant operation given assumed market conditions. Impairment charges (credits) included the following asset impairments (realized gains) for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003.

Subsequent to that date we recorded all advisor fees as reorganization costs. 60 Table of Contents Fresh Start Adjustments During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a net credit of $3.9 billion (comprised of a $4.1 billion gain from continuing operations and a $0.2 billion loss from discontinued operations) in connection with fresh start adjustments. Following is a summary of the significant effects of the reorganization and Fresh Start: (In millions) Discharge of corporate level debt $ 5,162 Discharge of other liabilities 811 Establishment of creditor pool (1,040 ) Receivable from Xcel 640 Revaluation of fixed assets (1,392 ) Revaluation of equity investments (207 ) Valuation of SO 2 emission credits 374 Valuation of out of market contracts, net (400 ) Fair market valuation of debt 108 Valuation of pension liabilities (61 ) Other valuation adjustments (100 ) Total Fresh Start adjustments 3,895 Less discontinued operations (224 ) Total Fresh Start adjustments continuing operations $ 4,119 Legal Settlement Charges During the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, we recorded $462.6 million of legal settlement charges which consisted of the following. We recorded $396.0 million in connection with the resolution of an arbitration claim asserted by FirstEnergy Corp. As a result of this resolution, FirstEnergy retained ownership of the Lake Plant Assets and received an allowed general unsecured claim of $396.0 million under NRG Energys Plan of Reorganization. In November 2003, we settled litigation with Fortistar Capital in which Fortistar Capital released us from all litigation claims in exchange for a $60.0 million pre petition bankruptcy claim and an $8.0 million post petition bankruptcy claim. We had previously recorded $10.8 million in connection with various legal disputes with Fortistar Capital; accordingly, we recorded an additional $57.2 million during November 2003. In November 2003, we settled our dispute with Dick Corporation in connection with Meriden Gas Turbines LLC through the payment of a general unsecured claim and a post petition pre confirmation payment. This settlement resulted in our recording an additional liability of $8.0 million in November 2003. In August 1995, we entered into a Marketing, Development and Joint Proposing Agreement, or the Marketing Agreement, with Cambrian Energy Development LLC, or Cambrian. Various claims arose in connection with the Marketing Agreement. In November 2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with Cambrian where we agreed to transfer our 100% interest in three gasco projects (NEO Ft. Smith, NEO Phoenix and NEO Woodville) and our 50% interest in two genco projects (MM Phoenix and MM Woodville) to Cambrian. In addition, we paid approximately $1.8 million in settlement of royalties incurred in connection with the Marketing Agreement. We had previously recorded a liability for royalties owed to Cambrian, therefore, we recorded an additional $1.4 million during November 2003. Other Income (Expense) Reorganized NRG During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded other expense of $171.9 million. Other expense consisted primarily of $269.4 million of interest expense, $71.6 million of refinancing related expenses, $1.0 million of minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries and $16.3 million of write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments, offset by $159.8 million of equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (including $68.9 million from our investment in West Coast Power LLC) and $26.6 million of other income, net. 61 Table of Contents Other income (expense) for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, was an expense of $5.4 million and consisted primarily of $18.9 million of interest expense, partially offset by $13.5 million of equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we recorded other expense of $286.9 million. Other expense consisted primarily of $329.9 million of interest expense and $147.1 million of write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments, partially offset by equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $170.9 million and $19.2 million of other income, net. Minority Interest in Earnings of Consolidated Subsidiaries For the year ended December 31, 2004, minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries was $1.0 million which relates primarily to our ownership interests in Northbrook Energy, LLC and Northbrook New York, LLC, partnerships which hold a portfolio of small hydro projects. For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries was $134,000 and relates primarily to Northbrook New York and Northbrook Energy. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Reorganized NRG For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded $159.8 million of equity earnings from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Our equity in earnings of West Coast Power comprised $68.9 million of this amount with our equity in earnings of Enfield, Mibrag, and Gladstone comprising $28.5 million, $20.9 million, and $17.5 million, respectively. Our investment in West Coast Power generated favorable results due to the pricing under the California Department of Water Resources contract. Additionally, revenues from ancillary services revenue and minimum load cost compensation power positively contributed to West Coast Powers operating results. However, our equity earnings in the project as reported in our results of operations have been reduced by a net $115.8 million to reflect a non cash basis adjustment for in the money contracts resulting from adoption of Fresh Start. NRG Energys equity earnings were also favorably impacted by $23.3 million of unrealized gain related to our Enfield investment. This gain is associated with changes in the fair value of energy related derivative instruments not accounted for as hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $13.5 million for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 consists primarily of equity earnings from our 50% ownership in West Coast Power of $9.4 million. Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we recorded $170.9 million of equity earnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Our 50% investment in West Coast Power comprised $98.7 million of this amount with our investments in the Mibrag, Loy Yang, Gladstone and Rocky Road projects comprising $21.8 million, $17.9 million, $12.4 million and $6.9 million, respectively, with the remaining amounts attributable to various domestic and international equity investments. 62 Table of Contents Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates consists of the following: Reorganized NRG Predecessor Company Year Ended December 6, 2003 January 1, 2003 Year Ended December 31, Through Through December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 December 5, 2003 2002 (In thousands) West Coast Power $ 68,895 $ 9,362 $ 98,741 $ 19,044 MIBRAG 20,938 102 21,818 28,750 Enfield 28,505 481 5,975 (6,017 ) Gladstone 17,528 997 12,440 7,237 Rocky Road 6,904 305 6,864 6,868 James River 7,750 543 (1,893 ) 9,713 NRG Saguaro 5,480 617 3,940 4,968 Scudder LA Trust 1,521 150 2,653 1,043 NRG National 846 190 2,010 1,695 MWPC RDF 200 8 123 259 NRG Cadillac (421 ) (2 ) 280 195 Central and Eastern European Energy Power Fund (47 ) (22 ) (260 ) (331 ) Loy Yang 17,924 8,443 Other 1,726 790 286 (12,871 ) Total Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates $ 159,825 $ 13,521 $ 170,901 $ 68,996 Write Downs and Losses on Sales of Equity Method Investments As part of our periodic review of our equity method investments for impairments, we have taken write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments during the year ended December 31, 2004 of $16.3 million and $147.1 million for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. Our Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership (CALP) and James River investments were written down based on indicative market bids. The sale of CALP closed in the fourth quarter of 2004, while the sale agreement for James River has been terminated. There were no write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. 63 Table of Contents Write downs and losses (gains) on sales of equity method investments recorded in the consolidated statement of operations include the following: Reorganized Predecessor NRG Company For the Period Year Ended January 1 December 31, December 5, 2004 2003 (In thousands) Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership $ 4,614 $ James River Power LLC 7,293 NEO Corporation 3,830 Calpine Cogeneration (735 ) NLGI Minnesota Methane 12,257 NLGI MM Biogas 2,613 Kondapalli (519 ) ECKG (2,871 ) Loy Yang 1,268 146,354 Mustang (12,124 ) Other 1,414 Total write downs and losses of equity method investments $ 16,270 $ 147,124 Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership (CALP) In June 2004, we executed an agreement to sell our 50% interest in CALP. During the third quarter of 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $3.7 million to write down the value of our investment in CALP to its fair value. The sale closed in November 2004, resulting in net cash proceeds of $14.9 million. Total impairment charges as a result of the sale were $4.6 million. James River Power LLC In September 2004, we executed an agreement with Colonial Power Company LLC to sell all of our outstanding shares of stock in Capistrano Cogeneration Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG Energy which owns a 50% interest in James River Cogeneration Company. During the third quarter of 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $6.0 million to write down the value of our investment in James River to its fair value. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the sale agreement was terminated. We continue to impair any additional equity earnings based on its fair value. Total impairment charges for 2004 were $7.3 million. NEO Corporation On September 30, 2004, we completed the sale of several NEO investments Four Hills LLC, Minnesota Methane II LLC, NEO Montauk Genco LLC and NEO Montauk Gasco LLC to Algonquin Power of Canada. The sale also included four wholly owned NEO subsidiaries (see Item 15 Note 6). We received cash proceeds of $6.1 million. The sale resulted in a loss of approximately $3.8 million attributable to the equity investment entities sold. Calpine Cogeneration In January 2004, we executed an agreement to sell our 20% interest in Calpine Cogeneration Corporation to Calpine Power Company. The transaction closed in March 2004 and resulted in net cash proceeds of $2.5 million and a net gain of $0.2 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we received additional consideration on the sale of $0.5 million, resulting in an adjusted net gain of $0.7 million. NLGI Minnesota Methane We recorded an impairment charge of $12.3 million during 2002 to write down our 50% investment in Minnesota Methane. We recorded an additional impairment charge of $14.5 million during the first quarter of 2003. These charges were related to a revised project outlook and managements belief that the decline in fair value was other than temporary. In May 2003, the project lenders to the wholly owned subsidiaries of NEO Landfill Gas, Inc. and Minnesota Methane LLC foreclosed on our membership interest in the NEO Landfill Gas, Inc. subsidiaries and our equity interest in Minnesota Methane LLC. Upon completion of the foreclosure, we recorded a gain of $2.2 million, resulting in a net impairment 64 Table of Contents charge of $12.3 million for the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003. This gain resulted from the release of certain obligations. NLGI MM Biogas We recorded an impairment charge of $3.2 million during 2002 to write down our 50% investment in MM Biogas. This charge was related to a revised project outlook and managements belief that the decline in fair value was other than temporary. In November 2003, we entered into a sales agreement with Cambrian Energy Development to sell our 50% interest in MM Biogas. We recorded an additional impairment charge of $2.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2003 due to developments related to the sale that indicated an impairment of our book value that was considered to be other than temporary. Kondapalli In the fourth quarter of 2002, we wrote down our investment in Kondapalli by $12.7 million due to recent estimates of sales value, which indicated an impairment of our book value that was considered to be other than temporary. On January 30, 2003, we signed a sale agreement with the Genting Group of Malaysia, or Genting, to sell our 30% interest in Lanco Kondapalli Power Pvt Ltd, or Kondapalli, and a 74% interest in Eastern Generation Services (India) Pvt Ltd (the O&M company). Kondapalli is based in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India, and is the owner of a 368 MW natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine. In the first quarter of 2003, we wrote down our investment in Kondapalli by $1.3 million based on the final sale agreement. The sale closed on May 30, 2003 resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately $24 million and a gain of approximately $1.8 million, resulting in a net gain of $0.5 million. The gain resulted from incurring lower selling costs than estimated as part of the first quarter impairment. ECKG In September 2002, we announced that we had reached agreement to sell our 44.5% interest in the ECKG power station in connection with our Csepel power generating facilities, and our interest in Entrade, an electricity trading business, to Atel, an independent energy group headquartered in Switzerland. The transaction closed in January 2003 and resulted in cash proceeds of $65.3 million and a net loss of less than $1.0 million. In accordance with the purchase agreement, we were to receive additional consideration if Atel purchased shares held by our partner. During the second quarter of 2003, we received approximately $3.7 million of additional consideration, resulting in a net gain of $2.9 million. Loy Yang Based on a third party market valuation and bids received in response to marketing Loy Yang for possible sale, we recorded a write down of our investment of approximately $111.4 million during 2002. This write down reflected managements belief that the decline in fair value of the investment was other than temporary. In May 2003, we entered into negotiations that culminated in the completion of a Share Purchase Agreement to sell 100% of the Loy Yang project. Consequently, we recorded an additional impairment charge of approximately $146.4 million during 2003. In April 2004, we completed the sale of Loy Yang which resulted in net cash proceeds of $26.7 million and a loss of $1.3 million. Mustang Station On July 7, 2003, we completed the sale of our 25% interest in Mustang Station, a gas fired combined cycle power generating plant located in Denver City, Texas, to EIF Mustang Holdings I, LLC. The sale resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately $13.3 million and a net gain of approximately $12.1 million. Other Income, net Reorganized NRG During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded $26.6 million of other income, net, consisting primarily of interest income earned on notes receivable and cash balances. For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 we recorded other income of $97,000. Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we recorded $19.2 million of other income, net. During this period other income, net consisted primarily of interest income earned on notes receivable and cash balances, offset in part by the unfavorable mark to market on our corporate level 160 million note that was cancelled in connection with our bankruptcy proceedings. 65 Table of Contents Interest Expense Reorganized NRG Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $269.4 million, consisting of interest expense on both our project and corporate level interest bearing debt. Significant amounts of our corporate level debt were forgiven upon our emergence from bankruptcy and we refinanced significant amounts of our project level debt with corporate level high yield notes and term loans in December 2003. Also included in interest expense is the amortization of debt financing costs of $9.2 million related to our corporate level debt and $13.3 million of amortization expense related primarily to debt discounts and premiums recorded as part of Fresh Start. Interest expense also includes the impact of any interest rate swaps that we have entered in order to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Interest expense for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 of $18.9 million consists primarily of interest expense at the corporate level, primarily related to the Second Priority Notes, term loan facility and revolving line of credit used to refinance certain project level financings. In addition, interest expense includes the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred as a result of our refinancing efforts and the amortization of discounts and premiums recorded upon the marking of our debt to fair value upon our adoption of the Fresh Start provision of SOP 90 7. Predecessor Company Interest expense for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 of $329.9 million consisted of interest expense on both our project and corporate level interest bearing debt. In addition, interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs and any interest rate swap termination costs. Interest expense during this period was favorably impacted by our ceasing to record interest expense on debt where it was probable that such interest would not be paid, such as the NRG Energy corporate level debt (primarily bonds) and the NRG Finance Company debt (construction revolver) due to our entering into bankruptcy in May 2003. We did not however cease to record interest expense on the project level debt outstanding at our Northeast Generating and South Central Generating facilities even though these entities were also in bankruptcy as these claims were deemed to be most likely not impaired and not subject to compromise. We also recorded substantial amounts of fees and costs related to our acquiring a debtor in possession financing arrangement while we were in bankruptcy. In addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy we wrote off any remaining deferred finance costs related to our corporate and project level debt including our Northeast and South Central project level debt as it was probable that they would be refinanced upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Interest expense was unfavorably impacted by an adverse mark to market on certain interest rate swaps that we have entered in order to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Due to our deteriorating financial condition during such period, hedge accounting treatment was ceased for certain of our interest rate swaps, causing changes in fair value to be recorded as interest expense. Refinancing Expense Refinancing expense was $71.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This amount includes $15.1 million of prepayment penalties and a $15.3 million write off of deferred financing costs related to refinancing certain amounts of our term loans with additional corporate level high yield notes in January 2004 and $13.8 million of prepayment penalties and a $26.8 million write off of deferred financing costs related to refinancing the senior credit facility in December 2004. Income Tax Expense Reorganized NRG Our income tax provision from continuing operations was $65.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and an income tax benefit of ($0.7) million for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. The overall effective tax rate in 2004 and the short period in 2003 was 28.7% and (6.2%), respectively. 66 Table of Contents The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a state tax refund received from Xcel Energy in 2003 and foreign income taxed in jurisdictions with tax rates different from the U.S. statutory rate. Our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2004 were offset by a full valuation allowance in accordance with SFAS No. 109. Under SOP 90 7, any future benefits from reducing a valuation allowance from preconfirmation deferred tax assets are required to be reported first as an adjustment of identifiable intangible assets and then as a direct addition to paid in capital versus a benefit on our statement of operations. The effective tax rate may vary from year to year depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses. These same and other factors, including history of pre tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets. Predecessor Company Income tax expense for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 was $37.9 million. The overall effective tax rate for the period ended December 5, 2003 was 1.3%. The rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a release in valuation allowance for net operating loss carryforwards that were utilized following our emergence from bankruptcy to offset the current tax on cancellation of debt income. Income taxes have been recorded on the basis that our U.S. subsidiaries and we would file separate federal income tax returns for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. Since our U.S. subsidiaries and we were not included in the Xcel Energy consolidated tax group, each of our U.S. subsidiaries that is classified as a corporation for U.S. income tax purposes filed a separate federal income tax return. It is uncertain if, on a stand alone basis, we would be able to fully realize deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary differences, therefore a full valuation allowance has been established. Income From Discontinued Operations, net of Income Taxes Reorganized NRG We classified as discontinued operations the operations and gains/losses recognized on the sale of projects that were sold or were deemed to have met the required criteria for such classification pending final disposition. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, of $23.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the period December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003, discontinued operations consisted of the results of our NRG McClain LLC, Penobscot Energy Recovery Company, or PERC, Compania Boliviana De Energia Electrica S.A. Bolivian Power Company Limited, or Cobee, Hsin Yu, LSP Energy (Batesville) and four NEO Corporation projects (NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO Prima Deshecha LLC and NEO Tajiguas LLC). All other discontinued operations were disposed of in prior periods. The $23.5 million income from discontinued operations includes a gain of $22.4 million, net of income taxes of $7.9 million, related primarily to the dispositions of Batesville, Cobee and Hsin Yu. Discontinued operations for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 is comprised of a loss of $0.4 million attributable to the on going operations of our McClain, PERC, Cobee, LSP Energy, Hsin Yu and four NEO Corporation projects (NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO Prima Deshecha LLC and NEO Tajiguas LLC). Predecessor Company As of December 5, 2003, we classified as discontinued operations the operations and gains/losses recognized on the sales of projects that were sold or were deemed to have met the required criteria for such classification pending final disposition. For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, discontinued operations consist of the historical operations and net gains/losses related to our Killingholme, McClain, PERC, Cobee, NEO Landfill Gas, Inc., or NLGI, seven NEO Corporation projects (NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO Prima Deshecha LLC, NEO Tajiguas LLC, NEO Ft. Smith LLC, NEO 67 Table of Contents Woodville LLC and NEO Phoenix LLC), Timber Energy Resources, Inc., or TERI, Cahua, Energia Pacasmayo, LSP Energy and Hsin Yu projects. For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, the results of operations related to such discontinued operations was a net loss of $182.6 million due to a loss on the sale of our Peru projects, impairment charges of $100.7 million and $23.6 million, respectively, recorded at McClain and NLGI and fresh start adjustments at LSP Energy. For the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Net Income Reorganized NRG During the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, we recognized net income of $11.0 million or $0.11 per share of common stock. Net income was directly attributable to a number of factors some of which are discussed below. From an overall operational perspective our facilities were profitable during this period. Our results were adversely impacted by our having to continue to satisfy the standard offer service contract that we entered into with Connecticut Light & Power, or CL&P, in 2000. As a result of our inability to terminate this contract during our bankruptcy proceeding, we continued to be exposed to losses under this contract. These losses were incurred, as we were unable to satisfy the requirements of this contract at a price/cost below the contracted sales price. Upon our adoption of Fresh Start, we recorded at fair value all assets and liabilities on our opening balance sheet and accordingly we recorded as an obligation the fair value of the CL&P contract. During the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, we recognized as revenues the entire fair value of this contract effectively offsetting the actual losses incurred under this contract. The CL&P contract terminated on December 31, 2003. Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we recorded net income of $2.8 billion. Net income for the period is directly attributable to our emerging from bankruptcy and adopting the Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90 7. Upon the confirmation of our Plan of Reorganization and our emergence from bankruptcy we were able to remove significant amounts of long term debt and other pre petition obligations from our balance sheet. Accordingly, as part of net income, we recorded a net gain of $3.9 billion (comprised of a $4.1 billion gain from continuing operations and a $0.2 billion loss from discontinued operations) as the impact of our adopting Fresh Start in our statement of operations. $6.0 billion of this amount is directly related to the forgiveness of debt and settlement of substantial amounts of our pre petition obligations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. In addition to the removal of substantial amounts of pre petition debt and other obligations from our balance sheet, we have also revalued our assets and liabilities to fair value. Accordingly, we have substantially written down the value of our fixed assets. We have recorded a net $1.6 billion charge related to the revaluation of our assets and liabilities within the Fresh Start Reporting adjustment line of our consolidated statement of operations. In addition to our recording adjustments related to our emergence from bankruptcy, we also recorded substantial charges related to other items such as the settlement of certain outstanding litigation in the amount of $462.6 million, write downs and losses on the sale of equity investments of $147.1 million, advisor costs and legal fees directly attributable to our being in bankruptcy of $197.8 million and $237.6 million of other asset impairment and restructuring costs incurred prior to our filing for bankruptcy. Net income for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 was favorably impacted by our not recording interest expense on substantial amounts of corporate level debt while we were in bankruptcy and by the continued favorable results experienced by our equity investments. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized a net loss of $3.5 billion. The loss from continuing operations incurred during 2002 primarily consisted of $2.6 billion of other charges consisting primarily of asset impairments. 68 Table of Contents Revenues from Majority Owned Operations Reorganized NRG Our operating revenues from majority owned operations were $138.5 million for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Predecessor Company Revenues from majority owned operations were $1.8 billion for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and include $992.6 million of energy revenues, $566.0 million of capacity revenues, $115.9 million of alternative energy, $12.9 million of O&M fees and $110.9 million of other revenues which include financial and physical gas sales, sales from our Schkopau facility and NEPOOL expense reimbursements. Revenues from majority owned operations during the period year ended December 5, 2003, were driven primarily by our North American operations and to a lesser degree by our international operations, primarily Australia. Our domestic Northeast and South Central power generation operations significantly contributed to our revenues due primarily to favorable market prices resulting from strong fuel and electricity prices. Our Australian operations were favorably impacted by favorable foreign exchange rates. During this period we also experienced an unfavorable impact on our revenues due to continued losses on our CL&P standard offer contract and the mark to market on certain of our derivatives. Revenues from majority owned operations were $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002. Cost of Majority Owned Operations Reorganized NRG Our cost of majority owned operations for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 was $95.5 million or 69.0% of revenues from majority owned operations. Predecessor Company Cost of majority owned operations was $1.4 billion, or 75.4% of revenues from majority owned operations for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. Cost of majority owned operations was unfavorably impacted by increased generation in the Northeast region, partially offset by a reduction in trading and hedging activity resulting from a reduction in our power marketing activities. Our international operations were unfavorably impacted due to an unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates and continued mark to market of the Osborne contract at Flinders resulting from lower pool prices. Our cost of majority owned operations related to continuing operations was $1.3 billion for 2002, or 68.7% of revenues from majority owned operations. Cost of majority owned operations, consists primarily of cost of energy (primarily fuel costs), labor, operating and maintenance costs and non income based taxes related to our majority owned operations. Cost of energy for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $900.9 million or 46.5% of revenue from majority owned operations. Depreciation and Amortization Reorganized NRG Our depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing operations was $11.8 million for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Depreciation and amortization expense consists of the allocation of our newly valued basis in our fixed assets over newly determined remaining fixed asset lives. As part of adopting the Fresh Start concepts of SOP 90 7, our tangible fixed assets were recorded at fair value as determined by a third party valuation expert who we also consulted with in determining the appropriate remaining lives for our tangible depreciable property. Depreciation expense for this period was based on preliminary depreciable lives and asset balances. 69 Table of Contents Predecessor Company Our depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing operations was $218.8 million for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and $207.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. During the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, depreciation expense was unfavorably impacted by the shortening of the depreciable lives of certain of our domestic power generation facilities located in the Northeast region and the impact of completed construction projects. Depreciation and amortization consists of the allocation of our historical depreciable fixed asset costs over the remaining lives of such property as well as the amortization of certain contract based intangible assets. General, Administrative and Development Reorganized NRG Our general, administrative and development costs for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 was $12.5 million or 9.0% of revenues from majority owned operations. These costs are primarily comprised of corporate labor, insurance and external professional support, such as legal, accounting and audit fees. Predecessor Company Our general, administrative and development costs for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 were $170.3 million, or 9.5% of revenues from majority owned operations. Our general, administrative and development costs for 2002 were $218.9 million, or 11.3% of revenues from majority owned operations. General, administrative and development costs for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 were favorably impacted by decreased costs related to work force reduction efforts, cost reductions due to the closure of certain international offices and reduced legal costs. Outside services also decreased, due to less non restructuring legal activities. Other Charges (Credits) Reorganized NRG During the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 we recorded $2.5 million of other charges related to reorganization items. Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, we recorded other credits of $3.2 billion, which consisted primarily of $228.9 million related to asset impairments, $462.6 million related to legal settlements, $197.8 million related to reorganization charges and $8.7 million related to restructuring charges. We also incurred a $4.1 billion credit related to Fresh Start adjustments. During 2002, we recorded other charges of $2.6 billion, which consisted primarily of $2.5 billion related to asset impairments and $111.3 million related to restructuring charges. We review the recoverability of our long lived assets on a periodic basis and if we determined that an asset was impaired, we compared asset carrying values to total future estimated undiscounted cash flows. Separate analyses are completed for assets or groups of assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The estimates of future cash flows included only future cash flows, net of associated cash outflows, directly associated with and expected to arise as a result of our assumed use and eventual disposition of the asset. Cash flow estimates associated with assets in service are based on the assets existing service potential. The cash flow estimates may include probability weightings to consider possible alternative courses of action and outcomes, given the uncertainty of available information and prospective market conditions. If an asset was determined to be impaired based on the cash flow testing performed, an impairment loss was recorded to write down the asset to its fair value. Estimates of fair value were based on prices for similar 70 Table of Contents assets and present value techniques. Fair values determined by similar asset prices reflect our current estimate of recoverability from expected marketing of project assets. For fair values determined by projected cash flows, the fair value represents a discounted cash flow amount over the remaining life of each project that reflects project specific assumptions for long term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs, and expected plant operation given assumed market conditions. Impairment charges (credits) included the following for the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002. There were no impairment charges for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003.

For the period from January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, we incurred $197.8 million in reorganization costs. All reorganization costs have been incurred since we filed for bankruptcy in May 2003. The following table provides the detail of the types of costs incurred (in thousands): Reorganized Predecessor NRG Company For the Period For the Period December 6 January 1 December 31, December 5, 2003 2003 (In thousands) Reorganization items Professional fees $ 2,461 $ 82,186 Deferred financing costs 55,374 Pre payment settlement 19,609 Interest earned on accumulated cash (1,059 ) Contingent equity obligation 41,715 Total reorganization items $ 2,461 $ 197,825 Restructuring Charges We incurred $8.7 million of employee separation costs and advisor fees during the period January 1, 2003 until we filed for bankruptcy in May 2003. Subsequent to that date we recorded all advisor fees as reorganization costs. We incurred total restructuring charges of approximately $111.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. These costs consisted of employee separation costs and advisor fees. Legal Settlement Charges During the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, we recorded $462.6 million of legal settlement charges which consisted of the following. We recorded $396.0 million in connection with the resolution of an arbitration claim asserted by FirstEnergy Corp. As a result of this resolution, FirstEnergy retained ownership of the Lake Plant Assets and received an allowed general unsecured claim of $396.0 million under NRG Energys plan of reorganization. In November 2003, we settled litigation with Fortistar Capital in which Fortistar Capital released us from all litigation claims in exchange for a $60.0 million pre petition bankruptcy claim and an $8.0 million post petition bankruptcy claim. We had previously recorded $10.8 million in connection with various legal disputes with Fortistar Capital; accordingly, we recorded an additional $57.2 million during November 2003. In November 2003, we settled our dispute with Dick Corporation in connection with Meriden Gas Turbines LLC through the payment of a general unsecured claim and a post petition pre confirmation payment. This settlement resulted in our recording an additional liability of $8.0 million in November 2003. In August 1995, we entered into a Marketing, Development and Joint Proposing Agreement, or the Marketing Agreement, with Cambrian Energy Development LLC, or Cambrian. Various claims arose in connection with the Marketing Agreement. In November 2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with Cambrian where we agreed to transfer our 100% interest in three gasco projects (NEO Ft. Smith, NEO Phoenix and NEO Woodville) and our 50% interest in two genco projects (MM Phoenix and MM Woodville) to Cambrian. In addition, we paid approximately $1.8 million in settlement of royalties incurred in connection with the Marketing Agreement. We had previously recorded a liability for royalties owed to Cambrian, therefore, we recorded an additional $1.4 million during November 2003. 72 Table of Contents Fresh Start Adjustments During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a net credit of $3.9 billion (comprised of a $4.1 billion gain from continuing operations and a $0.2 billion loss from discontinued operations) in connection with fresh start adjustments. Following is a summary of the significant effects of the reorganization and Fresh Start: (In millions) Discharge of corporate level debt $ 5,162 Discharge of other liabilities 811 Establishment of creditor pool (1,040 ) Receivable from Xcel 640 Revaluation of fixed assets (1,392 ) Revaluation of equity investments (207 ) Valuation of SO 2 emission credits 374 Valuation of out of market contracts, net (400 ) Fair market valuation of debt 108 Valuation of pension liabilities (61 ) Other valuation adjustments (100 ) Total Fresh Start adjustments 3,895 Less discontinued operations (224 ) Total Fresh Start adjustments continuing operations $ 4,119 Other Income (Expense) Reorganized NRG Other income (expense) for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, was an expense of $5.4 million and consisted primarily of $18.9 million of interest expense, partially offset by $13.5 million of equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we recorded other expense of $286.9 million. Other expense consisted primarily of $329.9 million of interest expense and $147.1 million of write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments, partially offset by equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $170.9 million and $19.2 million of other income. For the year ended December 31, 2002, other expenses were $572.2 million, which consisted primarily of $452.2 million of interest expense and $200.5 million of write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments, partially offset by equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $69.0 million and other income, net of $11.5 million. Minority Interest in Earnings of Consolidated Subsidiaries For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries was $134,000 and relates primarily to Northbrook New York and Northbrook Energy. 73 Table of Contents Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Reorganized NRG Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $13.5 million for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 consists primarily of equity earnings from our 50% ownership in West Coast Power of $9.4 million. Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we recorded $170.9 million of equity earnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Our 50% investment in West Coast Power comprised $98.7 million of this amount with our investments in the Mibrag, Loy Yang, Gladstone and Rocky Road projects comprising $21.8 million, $17.9 million, $12.4 million and $6.9 million, respectively, with the remaining amounts attributable to various domestic and international equity investments. Our investment in West Coast Power continues to generate favorable earnings as well as our investments in Mibrag, Loy Yang, Gladstone and Rocky Road. For the year ended December 31, 2002, equity earnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was $69.0 million. Write Downs and Losses on Sales of Equity Method Investments As we periodically review our equity method investments for impairments, we have taken substantial write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments during the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and for the year 2002. During the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, we recorded impairments and losses on the sales of investments of $147.1 million compared to $200.5 million in 2002. The $147.1 million recorded in 2003 consists primarily of the write down of our investment in the Loy Yang project of $146.4 million, our investment in the NEO Corporation Minnesota Methane project of $12.3 million and our investment in NEO Corporation MM Biogas of $2.6 million. These losses were partially offset by gains on the sale of our investment in the ECKG and Mustang projects of $2.9 million and $12.1 million, respectively. During 2002 we recorded write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments of $200.5 million. The $200.5 million recorded in 2002 consists primarily of a write down of our investment in the Loy Yang project of $111.4 million, a loss of $48.4 million on the transfer of our interest in the Sabine River Works project to our partner, a $14.2 million write down related to our investment in our EDL project, a write down of our investment in our Kondapalli project of $12.7 million and a write down of our investment in NEO Corporation Minnesota Methane and MM Biogas of $12.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively among others, offset by a $9.9 million gain on sale of our Kingston project. Other income, net Other income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on notes receivable and cash balances. We recorded $97,000, $19.2 million and $11.4 million of other income, net for the periods December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 and January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and for the year ended December 31, 2002, respectively. Interest expense Reorganized NRG Interest expense for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 of $18.9 million consists primarily of interest expense at the corporate level, primarily related to the Second Priority Notes, term loan facility and revolving line of credit used to refinance certain project level financings. In addition, interest expense includes the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred as a result of our refinancing efforts and the amortization of discounts and premiums recorded upon the marking of our debt to fair value upon our adoption of the Fresh Start provision of SOP 90 7. 74 Table of Contents Predecessor Company Interest expense for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 of $329.9 million consisted of interest expense on both our project and corporate level interest bearing debt. In addition, interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs and any interest rate swap termination costs. Subsequent to our entering into bankruptcy we ceased the recording of interest expense on our corporate level debt as these pre petition claims were deemed to be impaired and subject to compromise. We did not however cease to record interest expense on the project level debt outstanding at our Northeast Generating and South Central Generating facilities even though these entities were also in bankruptcy as these claims were deemed to be most likely not impaired and not subject to compromise. We also recorded substantial amounts of fees and costs related to our acquiring a debtor in possession financing arrangement while we were in bankruptcy. In addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy we wrote off any remaining deferred finance costs related to our corporate and project level debt including our Northeast and South Central project level debt as it was probable that they would be refinanced upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Interest expense was $452.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Income Tax Reorganized NRG Income tax benefit for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 was ($0.7) million and the overall effective tax rate was (6.2%). The rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a state tax refund received from Xcel Energy in 2003, foreign income taxed in jurisdictions with tax rates different from the U.S. statutory rate and a decrease in unfavorable permanent differences. Our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2003 were offset by a full valuation allowance in accordance with SFAS No. 109. Under SOP 90 7, any future benefits from reducing a valuation allowance from preconfirmation deferred tax assets are required to be reported as a direct addition to paid in capital versus a benefit on our income statement. Consequently, our effective tax rate in post bankruptcy emergence years will not benefit from the realization of our deferred tax assets, which were fully valued as of the date of our emergence from bankruptcy. The adoption of this Statement of Position will result in a disallowance of a future income statement benefit of $1.3 billion as a result of a reduction to the intangible asset for realization of benefits of fully valued deferred tax assets as of December 5, 2003 (date of emergence from bankruptcy). The effective tax rate may vary from year to year depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses. These same and other factors, including history of pre tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets. Predecessor Company Income tax expense (benefit) for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 was a tax expense of $37.9 million and a tax benefit of ($166.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The overall effective tax rate for the short period ended December 5, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002 was 1.3% and 5.6%, respectively. The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a release in valuation allowance for net operating loss carryforwards that were utilized following our emergence from bankruptcy to offset the current tax on cancellation of debt income. Discontinued Operations Reorganized NRG Discontinued operations for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 is comprised of a loss of $0.4 million attributable to the on going operations of our McClain, PERC, Cobee, LSP Energy, Hsin Yu and four NEO Corporation projects (NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO Prima Deshecha LLC and NEO Tajiguas LLC). 75 Table of Contents Predecessor Company As of December 5, 2003, we classified as discontinued operations the operations and gains/losses recognized on the sales of projects that were sold or were deemed to have met the required criteria for such classification pending final disposition. For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, discontinued operations consist of the historical operations and net gains/losses related to our Killingholme, McClain, PERC, Cobee, NLGI, seven NEO Corporation projects, TERI, Cahua, Energia Pacasmayo, LSP Energy and Hsin Yu projects. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 consisted of our Crockett Cogeneration, Entrade, Killingholme, Csepel, Bulo Bulo, McClain, PERC, Cobee, NLGI, seven NEO Corporation projects, TERI, Cahua, Energia Pacasmayo, LSP Energy and Hsin Yu projects. For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, the results of operations related to such discontinued operations was a net loss of $182.6 million due to a loss on the sale of our Peru projects, impairment charges of $100.7 million and $23.6 million, respectively, recorded at McClain and NLGI and fresh start adjustments at LSP Energy. During 2002, we recognized a loss on discontinued operations of $675.8 million due primarily to asset impairments recorded at Killingholme, NLGI, TERI, LSP Energy and Hsin Yu projects. Reorganization and Emergence from Bankruptcy On May 14, 2003, we and 25 of our U.S. affiliates, filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or the Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, or the bankruptcy court. On May 15, 2003, NRG Energy, PMI, NRG Finance Company I LLC, NRGenerating Holdings (No. 23) B.V. and NRG Capital LLC, collectively the Plan Debtors, filed the NRG plan of reorganization and the related Disclosure Statement for Reorganizing Debtors Joint Plan of Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as subsequently amended, or the Disclosure Statement. The Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the Disclosure Statement on June 30, 2003, and instructed the Plan Debtors to include certain additional disclosures. The Plan Debtors amended the Disclosure Statement and obtained Bankruptcy Court approval for the Third Amended Disclosure Statement for Debtors Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On November 24, 2003, the bankruptcy court issued an order confirming the NRG plan of reorganization, and the plan became effective on December 5, 2003. On September 17, 2003, the Northeast/ South Central plan of reorganization was proposed after we secured the necessary financing commitments. On November 25, 2003, the bankruptcy court issued an order confirming the Northeast/ South Central plan of reorganization and the plan became effective on December 23, 2003. Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code and Fresh Start Between May 14, 2003 and December 5, 2003, we operated as a debtor in possession under the supervision of the bankruptcy court. Our financial statements for reporting periods within that timeframe were prepared in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 90 7, Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code, or SOP 90 7. For financial reporting purposes, the close of business on December 5, 2003, represents the date of emergence from bankruptcy. As used herein, the following terms refer to the Company and its operations: Predecessor Company The Company, pre emergence from bankruptcy The Companys operations prior to December 6, 2003 Reorganized NRG The Company, post emergence from bankruptcy The Companys operations from December 6, 2003 December 31, 2004 76 Table of Contents The implementation of the NRG plan of reorganization resulted in, among other things, a new capital structure, the satisfaction or disposition of various types of claims against the Predecessor Company, the assumption or rejection of certain contracts, and the establishment of a new board of directors. In connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted Fresh Start in accordance with the requirements of SOP 90 7. The application of SOP 90 7 resulted in the creation of a new reporting entity. Under Fresh Start, the enterprise value of our company was allocated among our assets and liabilities on a basis substantially consistent with purchase accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations, or SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, we pushed down the effects of this allocation to all of our subsidiaries. Under the requirements of Fresh Start, we have adjusted our assets and liabilities, other than deferred income taxes, to their estimated fair values as of December 5, 2003. As a result of marking our assets and liabilities to their estimated fair values, we determined that there was no excess reorganization value that was reallocated back to our tangible and intangible assets. Deferred taxes were determined in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The net effect of all Fresh Start adjustments resulted in a gain of $3.9 billion (comprised of a $4.1 billion gain from continuing operations and a $0.2 billion loss from discontinued operations), which is reflected in the Predecessor Companys results of operations for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. The application of the Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90 7 created a new reporting entity having no retained earnings or accumulated deficit. As part of the bankruptcy process we engaged an independent financial advisor to assist in the determination of our reorganized enterprise value. The fair value calculation was based on managements forecast of expected cash flows from our core assets. Managements forecast incorporated forward commodity market prices obtained from a third party consulting firm. A discounted cash flow calculation was used to develop the enterprise value of Reorganized NRG, determined in part by calculating the weighted average cost of capital of the Reorganized NRG. The Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, valuation methodology equates the value of an asset or business to the present value of expected future economic benefits to be generated by that asset or business. The DCF methodology is a forward looking approach that discounts expected future economic benefits by a theoretical or observed discount rate. The independent financial advisors prepared a 30 year cash flow forecast using a discount rate of approximately 11%. The resulting reorganization enterprise value as included in the Disclosure Statement ranged from $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion. The independent financial advisor then subtracted our project level debt and made several other adjustments to reflect the values of assets held for sale, excess cash and collateral requirements to estimate a range of Reorganized NRG equity value of between $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion. In constructing our Fresh Start balance sheet upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we used a reorganization equity value of approximately $2.4 billion, as we believe this value to be the best indication of the value of the ownership distributed to the new equity owners. Our NRG plan of reorganization provided for the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of NRG common stock to the various creditors resulting in a calculated price per share of $24.04. Our reorganization value of approximately $9.1 billion was determined by adding our reorganized equity value of $2.4 billion, $3.7 billion of interest bearing debt and our other liabilities of $3.0 billion. The reorganization value represents the fair value of an entity before liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after restructuring. This value is consistent with the voting creditors and bankruptcy courts approval of the NRG plan of reorganization. We recorded approximately $3.9 billion of net reorganization income (comprised of a $4.1 billion gain from continuing operations and a $0.2 billion loss from discontinued operations) in the Predecessor Companys statement of operations for 2003, which includes the gain on the restructuring of equity and the discharge of obligations subject to compromise for less than recorded amounts, as well as adjustments to the historical carrying values of our assets and liabilities to fair market value. Due to the adoption of Fresh Start as of December 5, 2003, the Reorganized NRG post Fresh Start statement of operations and statement of cash flows have not been prepared on a consistent basis with the Predecessor Companys financial statements and are therefore not comparable in certain respects to the 77 Table of Contents financial statements prior to the application of Fresh Start. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared to distinguish between Reorganized NRG and the Predecessor Company. APB No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, requires us to effectively push down the effects of Fresh Start reporting to our unconsolidated equity method investments and to recognize an adjustment to our share of the earnings or losses of an investee as if the investee were a consolidated subsidiary. As a result of pushing down the impact of Fresh Start to our West Coast Power affiliate, we determined that a contract based intangible asset with a one year remaining life, consisting of the value of West Coast Powers California Department of Water Resources energy sales contract, must be established and recognized as a basis adjustment to our share of the future earnings generated by West Coast Power. This adjustment reduced our equity earnings in the amount of $115.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This contract expired in December 2004. Liquidity and Capital Resources Reorganized Capital Structure In connection with the consummation of our reorganization, on December 5, 2003, all shares of our old common stock were canceled and 100,000,000 shares of new common stock of NRG Energy were distributed pursuant to such plan in accordance with Section 1145 of the bankruptcy code to the holders of certain classes of claims. We received no proceeds from such issuance. A certain number of shares of common stock were issued and placed in the Disputed Claims Reserve for distribution to holders of disputed claims as such claims are resolved or settled. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings Disputed Claims Reserve. In the event our disputed claims reserve is inadequate, it is possible we will have to issue additional shares of our common stock to satisfy such pre petition claims or contribute additional cash proceeds. Our authorized capital stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of NRG Energy common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. A total of 4,000,000 shares of our common stock are available for issuance under our long term incentive plan. In addition to our issuance of new common stock, on December 23, 2003, we completed a note offering consisting of $1.25 billion of 8% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2013, or the Second Priority Notes, and we entered into a new $1.45 billion credit facility consisting of a $950.0 million term loan facility, a $250.0 million funded letter of credit facility and a $250.0 million revolving credit facility. In connection with the consummation of the NRG plan of reorganization, we issued to Xcel Energy a $10.0 million non amortizing promissory note, which accrues interest at a rate of 3% per annum and matures 2.5 years after the effective date of the NRG plan of reorganization. In January 2004, we completed a supplementary note offering whereby we issued an additional $475.0 million of the Second Priority Notes at a premium and used the proceeds to repay a portion of the $950.0 million term loan. On December 24, 2004, we amended and restated our existing $1.45 billion credit facility, recasting it as a $950 million secured credit facility made up of a $450.0 million seven year senior secured term loan, a $350.0 million funded letter of credit facility and a three year $150.0 million revolving line of credit. In December 2004, we also issued $420 million of convertible preferred stock and used the proceeds from such issuance to redeem $375 million of the Second Priority Notes in February 2005. Also in January 2005 and in March 2005, we used existing cash to purchase, at market prices, $25 million and $15.8 million, respectively, in face value of our Second Priority Notes. These notes were assumed by NRG Energy and therefore remain outstanding. As of March 21, 2005, we had $1.35 billion in aggregate principal amount of Second Priority Notes outstanding, $450.0 million principal amount outstanding under the term loan and $350 million of the funded letter of credit facility outstanding. $178.3 million of undrawn letters of credit remain available under the funded letter of credit facility. As of March 21, 2005, we had not drawn down on our revolving credit facility. 78 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the debt transactions: Outstanding at Outstanding at Outstanding at Date of Original December 31, December 31, March 21, Transaction Amount 2003 Activity 2004 Activity 2005 (In thousands) Xcel Promissory Note Dec. 6, 2003 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 NRG 8% Senior Secured Notes Dec. 23, 2003 $ 1,250,000 $ 1,250,000 $ 1,250,000 Tack on offering Jan. 28, 2004 $ 475,000 $ 475,000 $ 1,725,000 $ 1,725,000 Repurchase of Notes* Jan. 21 27, 2005 $ (25,000 ) Early Redemption Feb. 4, 2005 $ (375,000 ) (375,000 ) Repurchase of Notes* March 28, 2005 $ (15,838 ) $ 1,350,000 NRG Credit Facility Term loan Dec. 23, 2003 $ 950,000 $ 950,000 Letter of Credit facility Dec. 23, 2003 250,000 $ 250,000 Corporate Revolver Dec. 23, 2003 250,000 NRG New Credit Facility $ 1,450,000 $ 1,200,000 Refinancing of the Credit Facility Amended Credit Facility Term loan Dec. 24, 2004 $ 450,000 $ 450,000 $ 450,000 Letter of Credit facility Dec. 24, 2004 350,000 350,000 350,000 Corporate Revolver Dec. 24, 2004 150,000 NRG Amended Credit Facility $ 950,000 $ 800,000 $ 800,000 Total Corporate Level Debt $ 2,460,000 $ 2,535,000 $ 2,160,000 * The notes were assumed by NRG Energy and remain outstanding. As part of the NRG plan of reorganization, we eliminated approximately $5.2 billion of corporate level bank and bond debt and approximately $1.3 billion of additional claims and disputes through our distribution of new common stock and $1.04 billion in cash among our unsecured creditors. In addition to the debt reduction associated with the restructuring, we used the proceeds of the Second Priority Notes and borrowings under our credit facility to retire approximately $1.7 billion of project level debt. For additional information on our short term and long term borrowing arrangements, see Item 15 Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historical Cash Flows Reorganized NRG We have obtained cash from operations, Xcel Energys contribution net of distributions to creditors, proceeds from the sale of certain assets, borrowings under our Second Priority Notes and credit facilities and the proceeds from the sale of preferred stock. We have used these funds to finance operations, service debt obligations, finance capital expenditures, repurchase common stock and meet other cash and liquidity needs. Predecessor Company Historically, we have obtained cash from operations, issuance of debt and equity securities, borrowings under credit facilities, capital contributions from Xcel Energy, reimbursement by Xcel Energy of tax benefits pursuant to a tax sharing agreement and proceeds from non recourse project financings. We used these funds 79 Table of Contents to finance operations, service debt obligations, fund the acquisition, development and construction of generation facilities, finance capital expenditures and meet other cash and liquidity needs. Reorganized NRG Predecessor Company For the Period For the Period Year Ended December 6 January 1 Year Ended December 31, December 31, December 5, December 31, 2004 2003 2003 2002 (In thousands) Net cash provided (used) by operating activities $ 643,993 $ (588,875 ) $ 238,509 $ 430,042 Net cash (used) provided by investing activities 184,685 363,372 (185,679 ) (1,681,467 ) Net cash provided (used) by financing activities (283,734 ) 393,273 (29,944 ) 1,449,330 Net Cash Provided (Used) By Operating Activities Reorganized NRG For the year ended December 31, 2004, net cash provided by operating activities was $644.0 million. Net income of $185.6 million and adjustments of $383.3 million accounted for $568.9 million of the total cash provided by operating activities. Non cash adjustments consist primarily of depreciation, amortization and impairment charges offset by unrealized gains on derivatives. Cash provided by working capital of $75.0 million reflects a $100 million net resolution of a bankruptcy related receivable and payable offset by other working capital changes of $25.0 million. For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, net cash used by operating activities was $588.9 million. This was primarily a result of payments made to creditors upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Predecessor Company For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, net cash provided by operating activities was $238.5 million. Operating activities consisted of a net loss before Fresh Start adjustments of $1.1 billion, offset by non cash charges of $567.5 million and cash provided by working capital of $800.1 million. The non cash charges consisted primarily of the write down of our investment in Loy Yang, asset impairments and legal settlement charges. The favorable change in working capital was primarily due to reduced cash expenditures throughout the bankruptcy period resulting in increased accounts payable. For the year ended December 31, 2002, net cash provided by operating activities was $430.0 million. Operating activities consisted of a net loss before restructuring and impairment charges of $319.8 million offset by non cash charges of $144.5 million and cash provided by working capital of $605.3 million. Net Cash Provided (Used) By Investing Activities Reorganized NRG For the year ended December 31, 2004, net cash provided by investing activities was $184.7 million due primarily to sales proceeds, net of cash on hand, of $252.7 million on the sale of discontinued operations and sale proceeds of $50.7 million from the sale of investments, offset by capital expenditures of $114.4 million. For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, net cash provided by investing activities was $363.4 million. In connection with the refinancing transaction, approximately $375.3 million of restricted cash was released upon payment of the Northeast Generating and South Central Generating note. This increase was offset by funds used for capital expenditures and investments in projects. 80 Table of Contents Predecessor Company For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, net cash used in investing activities was $185.7 million. This was primarily a result of capital expenditures and an increase in restricted cash, offset by cash proceeds received upon the sale of investments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, net cash used by investing activities was $1.7 billion due primarily to $1.4 billion of capital expenditures. Net Cash Provided (Used) By Financing Activities Reorganized NRG For the year ended December 31, 2004, net cash used by financing activities was $283.7 million primarily due to reduction of long term debt by $159.3 million, which was primarily related to the McClain sale. Financing activities were also driven by an increase in the funded letter of credit asset balance of $100.0 million. In December 2004, the Company issued preferred stock for net proceeds of $406.4 million which enabled us to redeem $375.0 million of senior secured notes in 2005. Available cash balances were used to purchase 13 million shares of common stock owned by MatlinPatterson for a price of $405.3 million. For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, net cash provided by financing activities was $393.3 million. We entered into refinancing transactions on December 23, 2003, where we issued $1.25 billion of Second Priority Notes and entered into the New Credit Facility, which consisted of a $950.0 million senior secured term loan facility, a $250.0 million funded letter of credit facility and a $250.0 million unfunded revolving line of credit. Upon completion of the refinancing transactions, we repaid the Northeast Generating and South Central Generating notes and the Mid Atlantic Generating obligations. Predecessor Company For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, net cash used by financing activities was $29.9 million, which consisted primarily of principal payments offset by the issuance of additional debt. For the year ended December 31, 2002, net cash provided by financing activities was $1.4 billion which consisted primarily of increased debt of $945.3 and a capital contribution from Xcel Energy in the amount of $500.0 million. Sources of Funds The principal sources of liquidity for our future operations and capital expenditures are expected to be: (i) existing cash on hand and cash flows from operations and (ii) proceeds from the sale of certain assets and businesses. Additionally, we have approximately $192.9 million of undrawn letter of credit capacity under our senior credit facility as of December 31, 2004. On December 24, 2004, we amended our corporate bank facility, which at December 31, 2004 consists of a $450.0 million, seven year senior secured term loan, a $350.0 million funded letter of credit facility, and a three year $150.0 million revolving line of credit, or the revolving credit facility. With the refinancing, we lowered the interest rate on the term loan to LIBOR plus 1.875% from LIBOR plus 4.0%. Portions of the revolving credit facility are available as a swing line facility and as a revolving letter of credit sub facility. As of December 31, 2004, the corporate revolver was undrawn. On December 27, 2004, we completed the sale of $420 million of convertible perpetual preferred stock with a dividend coupon rate of 4%. The Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Preferred Stock. Holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefore, cash dividends at the rate of 4% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2005. The Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $40.00 per share, which is equal to an approximate conversion rate of 25 shares of common stock per share of Preferred Stock, subject to specified adjustments. On or after 81 Table of Contents December 20, 2009, we may redeem, subject to certain limitations, some or all of the Preferred Stock with cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, plus accumulated but unpaid dividends, including liquidated damages, if any, to the redemption date. Proceeds of $406.4 million from the sale of the preferred securities are net of securities issuance costs of approximately $13.6 million, and on February 4, 2005, these proceeds along with cash on hand were used to redeem $375.0 million in Second Priority Notes, pay an early redemption penalty of $30.0 million and pay accrued interest of $4.1 million on the redeemed notes. Cash Flows. Our operating cash flows are expected to be impacted by, among other things: (i) spark spreads generally; (ii) commodity prices (including demand for natural gas, coal, oil and electricity); (iii) the cost of ordinary course operations and maintenance expenses including margin and collateral calls for our trading operation; (iv) planned and unplanned outages; (v) contraction of terms by trade creditors; (vi) cash requirements for closure and restructuring of certain facilities; (vii) restrictions in the declaration or payments of dividends or similar distributions from our subsidiaries; and (viii) the timing and nature of asset sales. A principal component of the NRG plan of reorganization is a settlement with Xcel Energy in which Xcel Energy agreed to make a contribution to us consisting of cash (and, under certain circumstances, its common stock) in an aggregate amount of up to $640.0 million to be paid in three separate installments. Xcel Energy contributed $288.0 million on February 20, 2004, $328.5 million on April 30, 2004 and $23.5 million on May 28, 2004. We distributed $540.0 million of cash we received from Xcel Energy to our creditors pursuant to our plan of reorganization. We retained the remaining $100.0 million, which we used for general corporate purposes. Asset Sales. We received $303.4 million, $196.5 million and $229.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of certain assets and businesses in the fiscal years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Amended Credit Facility and the indenture governing the notes place restrictions on the use of any proceeds we may receive from certain asset sales in the future. Letter of Credit Sub facility and Revolving Credit Facility. The Amended Credit Facility includes a letter of credit sub facility in the amount of $350.0 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had issued $157.1 million in letters of credit under this facility, leaving $192.9 million available for future issuance. The Amended Credit Facility also includes a revolving credit facility in the amount of $150.0 million to be used for general corporate purposes. On December 31, 2004 our revolving credit facility was undrawn. For additional information regarding our debt see Item 15 Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Uses of Funds Our requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating our facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) PMI activities; (ii) capital expenditures; (iii) corporate financial restructuring and (iv) project finance requirements for cash collateral. PMI. PMI activities comprise the single largest requirement for liquidity and capital resources. PMI liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counter parties; (ii) initial collateral required to establish trading relationships; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (i.e., buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); and (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions. As of December 31, 2004, PMI had total collateral outstanding of $47.8 million in margin, prepayments and cash deposits and $83.1 million outstanding in letters of credit to third parties. Future liquidity requirements may change based on our hedging activity, fuel purchases, future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on our credit ratings and general perception of creditworthiness. We do not assume that we will be given unsecured credit from third parties in budgeting our working capital requirements. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, $10.6 million for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, $113.5 million for the period 82 Table of Contents January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and $1.4 billion for the year ended 2002. Capital expenditures in 2004 relate primarily to the conversion of our western New York plants to low sulfur coal, the Playford 2 refurbishment at our Flinders operation in Australia and planned outages across our fleet. Capital expenditures in 2003 relate primarily to operations and maintenance of our existing generating facilities whereas capital expenditures in 2002 related primarily to new plant construction. In 2005, we anticipate we will spend approximately $133.3 million in capital expenditures and an additional $109.5 million in major maintenance expense related primarily to the operation and maintenance of our existing generating facilities. Corporate Financial Restructuring. We may elect periodically to modify our corporate financial structure in order to increase near term or long term cash flows or to reduce exposure to financial risks. On December 21, 2004, we purchased 13 million shares of common equity interest in NRG Energy from investment partnerships managed by MatlinPatterson. Total costs associated with the repurchase, including fees and expenses, was $405.3 million. On February 4, 2005, we used proceeds from our Preferred Stock issuance to redeem early $375.0 million of our Second Priority Notes at par value plus 8%. We also paid outstanding accrued interest and liquidated damage penalties attributable to the redeemed notes. In January 2005 and March 2005, we repurchased $25.0 million and $15.8 million, respectively, of our notes, which remain outstanding. As of March 21, 2005, $1.35 billion in Second Priority Notes remain outstanding. Preferred Dividend Payment. On March 15, 2005, we made a $3.9 million dividend payment to our preferred shareholders of record as of March 1, 2005. This represents the first quarterly dividend payment we anticipate making to our preferred shareholders. Project Finance Requirements. We are a holding company and conduct our operations through subsidiaries. Historically, we have utilized project level debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct our power plants and related assets. Consistent with our strategy, we may seek, where available on commercially reasonable terms, project level debt in connection with the assets or businesses that our affiliates or we may develop, construct or acquire. Project level borrowings are substantially non recourse to other subsidiaries, affiliates and us, and are generally secured by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of the related project subsidiary or affiliate being financed. Some of these project financings may require us to post collateral in the form of cash or an acceptable letter of credit. In February 2005, Flinders amended its debt facility of AUD 279.4 million (approximately US $218.5 million) in floating rate debt. The amendment extended the maturity to February 2017, reduced borrowing costs and reserve requirements, minimized debt service coverage ratios, removed mandatory cash sharing arrangements, and made other minor modifications to terms and conditions. The facility includes an AUD 20 million (approximately US $15.7 million) working capital and performance bond facility. NRG Flinders is required to maintain interest rate hedging contracts on a rolling 5 year basis at a minimum level of 60% of principal outstanding. Upon execution of the amendment, a voluntary principal prepayment of AUD 50 million (approximately US $39.1 million) was made, reducing the principal balance to AUD 229.2 million (approximately $179.4 million). 83 Table of Contents Principal on short term debt, long term debt and capital leases as of December 31, 2004 are due and payable in the following periods (in thousands): Subsidiary/Description Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Xcel Energy Note $ 10,000 $ $ 10,000 $ $ $ $ Credit Facility Due Dec. 2011 800,000 8,000 8,000 8,000 8,000 8,000 760,000 8% Second Priority Notes due Dec. 2013 1,725,000 400,000 1,325,000 NRG Energy Center Minneapolis, due 2013 and 2017 118,950 7,877 8,465 9,097 9,776 10,507 73,228 NRG Peaker Finance Co LLC 300,876 4,312 6,768 11,164 12,903 14,758 250,971 Flinders Power Finance Pty 202,856 11,564 13,443 14,633 15,931 14,083 133,202 NRG Energy Center San Francisco 129 32 31 37 29 Camas Pwr BLR LP Bank facility 6,275 2,442 2,533 1,300 Camas Pwr BLR LP Bonds 4,475 1,385 1,485 1,605 Itiquira Energetica S.A., due January 2012 20,078 2,845 2,845 2,845 2,845 2,845 5,853 Itiquira Energetica S.A., due April 2011 31,002 3,875 3,875 3,875 3,875 15,502 Northbrook New York 16,900 500 600 700 800 850 13,450 Northbrook Carolina 2,375 100 100 150 150 150 1,725 Northbrook STS HydroPower 24,329 477 523 572 627 807 21,323 Subtotal Debt, Bonds and Notes 3,263,245 439,534 58,668 53,978 54,936 55,875 2,600,254 Saale Energie GmbH, Schkopau (capital lease) 303,803 69,904 51,785 38,612 31,693 23,786 88,023 Audrain Generating (capital lease) 239,930 239,930 Conemaugh Fuels LLC (capital lease) 218 16 18 19 20 22 123 Subtotal Capital Leases 543,951 69,920 51,803 38,631 31,713 23,808 328,076 Total Debt $ 3,807,196 $ 509,454 $ 110,471 $ 92,609 $ 86,649 $ 79,683 $ 2,928,330 These amounts reflect scheduled amortization of principal as of December 31, 2004, with the exception of the 8% Senior Secured Notes, for which 2005 amounts reflect early redemption and repurchases made through March 21, 2005. See Item 15 Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on events that may affect debt payment schedules. On December 24, 2004, we amended and restated our senior credit facility, which now consists of a $450.0 million, seven year senior secured term loan facility, a $350.0 million funded letter of credit facility, and a three year revolving credit facility in an amount up to $150.0 million. At that time, we paid $13.8 million in prepayment breakage costs, $3.2 million in accrued but unpaid interest and fees, and $16.7 million in other costs associated with the amendment. The balance outstanding under this facility was $800.0 million as of December 31, 2004. Other expenses include commitment fees on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility, participation fees for the credit linked deposit and other fees. As of December 31, 2004, the $350.0 million letter of credit facility was fully funded and reflected as a funded letter of credit on the December 31, 2004 balance sheet. As of December 31, 2004, $157.1 million in letters of credit had been issued under this facility, leaving $192.9 million available for future issuances. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to our subsidiaries, the inability of any of our subsidiaries that have near term debt payment obligations to obtain non recourse project financing may result in such subsidiarys insolvency and the loss of our investment in such subsidiary. Additionally, the loss of a significant customer at any of our subsidiaries could result in the need to restructure the non recourse project 84 Table of Contents financing at that subsidiary, and the inability to successfully complete a restructuring of the non recourse project financing may result in a loss of our investment in such subsidiary. Certain of our projects are subject to restrictions regarding the movement of cash. For additional information see Item 15 Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity Estimates For 2005, we anticipate utilizing $300 million of our letter of credit facility. In addition, PMI may require additional capital resources depending upon our hedging activity, fuel purchases and future market conditions. As part of our refinancing transactions, we have a $150.0 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility was established to satisfy short term working capital requirements, which may arise from time to time. It is not our current intention to draw funds under the revolving credit facility. On February 4, 2005, utilizing net proceeds of $406.4 million from the sale of preferred securities in December 2004, we redeemed $375.0 million in Second Priority Notes. At the same time, we paid $30.0 million for the early redemption premium on the redeemed notes, $4.1 million in accrued but unpaid interest on the redeemed notes and $0.4 million in accrued but unpaid liquidated damages on the redeemed notes. On March 15, 2005, we made a $3.9 million dividend payment to our preferred shareholders of record as of March 1, 2005. This represents the first quarterly dividend payment we anticipate making to our preferred shareholders. Other Liquidity Matters We expect our capital requirements to be met with existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, borrowings under our Second Priority Notes and Amended Credit Facility, and asset sales. We believe that our current level of cash availability and asset sales, along with our future anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet the existing operational and collateral needs of our business for the next 12 months. Subject to restrictions in our Second Priority Notes and our Amended Credit Facility, if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell assets, obtain additional credit facilities or other financings and or issue additional equity or convertible instruments. We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, such that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Net Operating Loss Carryforwards For the year ended December 31, 2004, we generated a net operating loss carryforward of $102.1 million which will expire through 2024. We believe that it is more likely than not that no benefit will be realized on the deferred tax assets relating to the net operating loss carryforwards. This assessment included consideration of positive and negative factors, including our current financial position and results of operations, projected future taxable income, including projected operating and capital gains, and available tax planning strategies. Therefore, as of December 31, 2004, a valuation allowance of $707.9 million was recorded against the net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards in accordance with SFAS No. 109. Off Balance Sheet Items As of December 31, 2004, we have not entered into any financing structure that is designed to be off balance sheet that would create liquidity, financing or incremental market risk or credit risk to us. However, we have numerous investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy related entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as disclosed in Item 15 85 Table of Contents Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our pro rata share of non recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $251.7 million as of December 31, 2004. The decline was largely a result of sales of our interest in Calpine Cogeneration, Loy Yang and Commonwealth Atlantic. In the normal course of business we may be asked to loan funds to the unconsolidated affiliates on both a long and short term basis. Such transactions are generally accounted for as accounts payable and receivable to/from affiliates and notes payable/receivable to/from affiliates and if appropriate, bear market based interest rates. See Item 15 Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding amounts accounted for as notes receivable affiliates. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments We have a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to our capital expenditure programs. The following is a summarized table of contractual obligations. See additional discussion in Item 15 Notes 18, 27 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2004, we also entered into coal purchase contracts extending through 2007. In March 2005, we entered into an agreement to purchase 23.75 million tons of coal over a period of four years and nine months from Buckskin Mining Company or Buckskin. The coal will be sourced from Buckskins mine in the Powder River Basin, Wyoming, and will be used primarily in NRG Energys coal burning generation plants in the South Central region. In August 2004, we entered into a contract to purchase 1,540 aluminum railcars from Johnston America Corporation to be used for the transportation of low sulfur coal from Wyoming to NRG Energys coal burning generating plants, including the Cajun Facilities. On February 18, 2005, we entered into a ten year operating lease agreement with GE Railcar Services Corporation, or GE, for the lease of 1,500 railcars and delivery 86 Table of Contents commenced in February 2005. We have assigned certain of our rights and obligations for 1,500 railcars under the purchase agreement with Johnston America to GE. Accordingly, the railcars which we lease from GE under the arrangement described above will be purchased by GE from Johnston America in lieu of our purchase of those railcars. Interdependent Relationships We do not have any significant interdependent relationships. Derivative Instruments We may enter into long term power sales contracts, long term gas purchase contracts and other energy related commodities financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices, hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities and protect fuel inventories. In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of our variable rate and fixed rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements. The tables below disclose the trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; identify changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2004 based on whether fair values are determined by quoted market prices or more subjective means; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2004.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles 87 Table of Contents generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable. In any case, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table identifies certain of the significant accounting policies listed in Item 15 Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table also identifies the judgments required, uncertainties involved in the application of each and estimates that may have a material impact on our results of operations and statement of financial position. These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. We identify our most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting Policy Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application Fresh Start Reporting The determination of the enterprise value and the allocation to the underlying assets and liabilities are based on a number of estimates and assumptions, which are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies Determination at Fresh Start date Consolidation of entities remaining in bankruptcy Valuation of emission credit allowances and power sales contracts Valuation of debt instruments Valuation of equity investments Capitalization Practices Determination of beginning and ending of capitalization periods Allocation of purchase prices to identified assets Asset Valuation and Impairment Recoverability of investment through future operations Regulatory and political environments and requirements Estimated useful lives of assets Environmental obligations and operational limitations Estimates of future cash flows Estimates of fair value (fresh start) Judgment about triggering events Revenue Recognition Customer/counter party dispute resolution practices 88 Table of Contents Accounting Policy Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application Market maturity and economic conditions Contract interpretation Uncollectible Receivables Economic conditions affecting customers, counter parties, suppliers and market prices Regulatory environment and impact on customer financial condition Outcome of litigation and bankruptcy proceedings Derivative Financial Instruments Market conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commitments Assumptions used in valuation models Documentation requirements Counter party credit risk Market conditions in foreign countries Regulatory and political environments and requirements Litigation Claims and Assessments Impacts of court decisions Estimates of ultimate liabilities arising from legal claims Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets Ability of tax authority decisions to withstand legal challenges or appeals Anticipated future decisions of tax authorities Application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions. Ability to utilize tax benefits through carrybacks to prior periods and carryforwards to future periods. Discontinued Operations Consistent application Determination of fair value (recoverability) Recognition of expected gain or loss prior to disposition Pension Accuracy of management assumptions Accuracy of actuarial consultant assumptions Stock Based Compensation Accuracy of management assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock options Of all of the accounting policies identified in the above table, we believe that the following policies and the application thereof to be those having the most direct impact on our financial position and results of operations. Fresh Start Reporting In connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted Fresh Start in accordance with the requirements of SOP 90 7. The application of SOP 90 7 resulted in the creation of a new reporting entity. Under Fresh Start, the reorganization value of our company was allocated among our assets and liabilities on a basis substantially consistent with purchase accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. The bankruptcy court in its confirmation order approved our plan of reorganization on November 24, 2003. Under the requirements of SOP 90 7, the Fresh Start date is determined to be the confirmation date unless significant uncertainties exist regarding the effectiveness of the bankruptcy order. Our plan of 89 Table of Contents reorganization required completion of the Xcel Energy settlement agreement prior to emergence from bankruptcy. We believe this settlement agreement was a significant contingency and thus delayed the Fresh Start date until the Xcel Energy settlement agreement was finalized on December 5, 2003. Under the requirements of Fresh Start, we adjusted our assets and liabilities, other than deferred income taxes, to their estimated fair values as of December 5, 2003. As a result of marking our assets and liabilities to their estimated fair values, we determined that there was no excess reorganization value to recognize as an intangible asset. Deferred taxes were determined in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The net effect of all Fresh Start adjustments resulted in a gain of $3.9 billion (comprised of a $4.1 billion gain from continuing operations and a $0.2 billion loss from discontinued operations), which is reflected in the Predecessor Companys results for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. The application of the Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90 7 created a new reporting entity having no retained earnings or accumulated deficit. As part of the bankruptcy process we engaged an independent financial advisor to assist in the determination of the fair value of our reorganized enterprise value. The fair value calculation was based on managements forecast of expected cash flows from our core assets. Managements forecast incorporated forward commodity market prices obtained from a third party consulting firm. A discounted cash flow calculation was used to develop the enterprise value of Reorganized NRG, determined in part by calculating the weighted average cost of capital of the Reorganized NRG. The Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, valuation methodology equates the value of an asset or business to the present value of expected future economic benefits to be generated by that asset or business. The DCF methodology is a forward looking approach that discounts all expected future economic benefits by a theoretical or observed discount rate. The independent financial advisor prepared a 30 year cash flow forecast using a discount rate of approximately 11%. The resulting reorganization enterprise value ranged from $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion. The independent financial advisor then subtracted our project level debt and made several other adjustments to reflect the values of assets held for sale, excess cash and collateral requirements to estimate a range of Reorganized NRG equity value of between $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion. In constructing our Fresh Start balance sheet upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we used a reorganization equity value of approximately $2.4 billion, as we believe this value to be the best indication of the value of the ownership distributed to the new equity owners. Our reorganization value of approximately $9.1 billion was determined by adding our reorganized equity value of $2.4 billion, $3.7 billion of interest bearing debt and our other liabilities of $3.0 billion. The reorganization value represents the fair value of an entity before liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after restructuring. This value is consistent with the voting creditors and Courts approval of the Plan of Reorganization. A separate plan of reorganization was filed for our Northeast Generating and South Central Generating entities that was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on November 25, 2003, and became effective on December 23, 2003, when the final conditions of the plan were completed. In connection with Fresh Start on December 5, 2003, we have accounted for these entities as if they had emerged from bankruptcy at the same time that we emerged, as we believe that we continued to maintain control over the Northeast Generating and South Central Generating facilities throughout the bankruptcy process. Due to the adoption of Fresh Start upon our emergence from bankruptcy, the Reorganized NRGs post fresh start balance sheet, statement of operations and statement of cash flows have not been prepared on a consistent basis with the Predecessor Companys financial statements and are therefore not comparable in certain respects to the financial statements prior to the application of Fresh Start. Capitalization Practices Reorganized NRG In connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted Fresh Start in accordance with the requirements of SOP 90 7. The application of SOP 90 7 resulted in the creation of a new reporting entity. 90 Table of Contents Under Fresh Start, the reorganization value of our company was allocated to our assets and liabilities on a basis substantially consistent with purchase accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141. We engaged a valuation specialist to help us determine the fair value of our fixed assets. The valuations were based on forecast power prices and operating costs determined by us. The valuation specialist also determined the estimated remaining useful lives of our fixed assets. Predecessor Company For those assets that were being constructed by us, the carrying value reflects the application of our property, plant and equipment policies which incorporate estimates, assumptions and judgments by management relative to the capitalized costs and useful lives of our generating facilities. Interest incurred on funds borrowed to finance projects expected to require more than three months to complete is capitalized. Capitalization of interest is discontinued when the asset under construction is ready for our intended use or when construction is terminated. An insignificant amount of interest was capitalized during 2003. Development costs and capitalized project costs include third party professional services, permits and other costs that are incurred incidental to a particular project. Such costs are expensed as incurred until an acquisition agreement or letter of intent is signed, and our board of directors has approved the project. Additional costs incurred after this point are capitalized. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We evaluate property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to us. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the periods December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 and January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and for the year ended December 31, 2002, net income from continuing operations was reduced by $44.7 million, $0 million, $228.9 million and $2.5 billion, respectively, due to asset impairments. Asset impairment evaluations are by nature highly subjective. Revenue Recognition and Uncollectible Receivables We are primarily an electric generation company, operating a portfolio of majority owned electric generating plants and certain plants in which our ownership is 50% or less which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We also produce thermal energy for sale to customers. Both physical and financial transactions are entered into to optimize the financial performance of our generating facilities. Electric energy revenue is recognized upon transmission to the customer. In regions where bilateral markets exist and physical delivery of electricity is common from our plants, we record revenue on a gross basis. In certain markets, which are operated/controlled by an independent system operator and in which we have entered into a netting agreement with the ISO, which results in our receiving a netted invoice, we have recorded purchased energy as an offset against revenues received upon the sale of such energy. Revenues derived from the buying and selling of electricity not sourced from our facilities are reported net. Capacity and ancillary revenue is recognized when contractually earned. Revenues from operations and maintenance services are recognized when the services are performed. We continually assess the collectibility of our receivables, and in the event we believe a receivable to be uncollectible, an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded or, in the event of a contractual dispute, the receivable and corresponding revenue may be considered unlikely of recovery and not recorded in the financial statements until management is satisfied that it will be collected. 91 Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments In January 2001, we adopted FAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, or SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149. SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires us to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. In some cases hedge accounting may apply. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are a) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure, b) whether or not the overall risk is being reduced and c) if there is correlation between the value of the derivative instrument and the underlying obligation. Formal documentation of the hedging relationship, the nature of the underlying risk, the risk management objective, and the means by which effectiveness will be assessed is created at the inception of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of non hedge derivatives are immediately recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged assets, liabilities and firm commitments or for forecasted transactions, deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, or OCI, until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings. We primarily account for derivatives under SFAS No. 133, as amended, such as long term power sales contracts, long term gas purchase contracts and other energy related commodities and financial instruments used to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices, hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities and to protect investments in fuel inventories. SFAS No. 133, as amended, also applies to interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange rate contracts. The application of SFAS No. 133, as amended, results in increased volatility in earnings due to the recognition of unrealized gains and losses. In determining the fair value of these derivative/financial instruments we use estimates, various assumptions, judgment of management and when considered appropriate third party experts in determining the fair value of these derivatives. Discontinued Operations We classify our results of operations that either have been disposed of or are classified as held for sale as discontinued operations if both of the following conditions are met: (a) the operations and cash flows have been (or will be) eliminated from our ongoing operations as a result of the disposal transaction and (b) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction. Prior periods are restated to report the operations as discontinued. Pensions The determination of our obligation and expenses for pension benefits is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions. These assumptions determined by management include the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation increases. Our actuarial consultants use assumptions for such items as retirement age. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results, which may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension obligation or expense recorded by us. Stock Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, or SFAS No. 123. In accordance with SFAS Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, or SFAS No. 148, we adopted SFAS No. 123 under the prospective transition method which requires the application of the recognition provisions to all employee awards granted, modified, or settled after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied. The Black Scholes option pricing model is used for all non qualified stock options. Recent Accounting Developments In November 2004, the Emerging Issue Task Force, or EITF, issued EITF No. 03 13, Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations. EITF 03 13 clarifies the 92 Table of Contents definition of cash flows of a component in which the seller engages in activities with the component after disposal, and significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction, and is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2004. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. This statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, and requires that idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal established by ARB No. 43. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, a revision to SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and its related implementation guidance. SFAS 123R establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, including obtaining employee services in share based payment transactions. SFAS 123R applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date. Adoption of the provisions of SFAS 123R is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. We have previously adopted SFAS No. 123, and we are currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS 123R will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued two FASB Staff Positions, or FSPs, regarding the accounting implications of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 related to (1) the deduction for qualified domestic production activities (FSP FAS 109 1) and (2) the one time tax benefit for the repatriation of foreign earnings (FSP FAS 109 2). In FSP FAS 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the Board decided that the deduction for qualified domestic production activities should be accounted for as a special deduction under FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes and rejected an alternative view to treat it as a rate reduction. Accordingly, any benefit from the deduction should be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the tax return. FSP FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, addresses the appropriate point at which a company should reflect in its financial statements the effects of the one time tax benefit on the repatriation of foreign earnings. Because of the proximity of the Acts enactment date to many companies year ends, its temporary nature, and the fact that numerous provisions of the Act are sufficiently complex and ambiguous, the Board decided that absent additional clarifying regulations, companies may not be in a position to assess the impact of the Act on their plans for repatriation or reinvestment of foreign earnings. Therefore, the Board provided companies with a practical exception to FAS 109s requirements by providing them additional time to determine the amount of earnings, if any, that they intend to repatriate under the Acts beneficial provisions. The Board confirmed, however, that upon deciding that some amount of earnings will be repatriated, a company must record in that period the associated tax liability, thereby making it clear that a company cannot avoid recognizing a tax liability when it has decided that some portion of its foreign earnings will be repatriated. We are currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of FSP FAS 109 1 and FSP FAS 109 2 will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to several market risks in our normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with our merchant power generation or with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transaction. The types of market risks we are exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk and currency exchange risk. In order to manage these risks we utilize various fixed 93 Table of Contents price forward purchase and sales contracts, futures and option contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps and options traded in the over the counter financial markets to: Manage and hedge our fixed price purchase and sales commitments; Manage and hedge our exposure to variable rate debt obligations, Reduce our exposure to the volatility of cash market prices; and Hedge our fuel requirements for our generating facilities. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices, volatilities in commodities, and correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal and oil. A number of factors influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products. These factors include: Seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand, Extreme peak demands due to weather conditions, Available supply resources, Transportation availability and reliability within and between regions, Changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations. As part of our overall portfolio, we manage the commodity price risk of our merchant generation by entering into various derivative or non derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of electricity and purchases of fuel. These instruments include forward purchase and sale contracts, futures and option contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps and options traded in the over the counter financial markets. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon managements assessment of market, weather, operational, and other factors. While some of the contracts we use to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources, other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices, contract quantities, or both. We use our best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts we hold and sell. These estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations, time value, volatility factors, and credit exposure. However, it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording mark to market derivative instrument valuation, and such variations could be material. We measure the sensitivity of our portfolio to potential changes in market prices using value at risk. Value at risk is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price volatility. We calculate value at risk using a variance/covariance technique that models positions using a linear approximation of their value. Our value at risk calculation includes mark to market and non mark to market energy assets and liabilities. We utilize a diversified value at risk model to calculate the estimate of potential loss in the fair value of our energy assets and liabilities including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions. The key assumptions for our diversified model include (1) a lognormal distribution of price returns, (2) one day holding period, (3) a 95% confidence interval, (4) a rolling 24 month forward looking period and (5) market implied price volatilities and historical price correlations. 94 Table of Contents This model encompasses the following generating regions: ENTERGY, NEPOOL, NYPP, PJM, WSCC and MAIN. The estimated maximum potential loss in fair value of our commodity portfolio, including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transaction, calculated using the diversified VAR model is as follows: (In millions) Year end December 31, 2004 $ 26.7 Average 40.3 High 53.4 Low 26.7 Year end December 31, 2003 37.1 Average 45.7 High 53.0 Low 37.1 In order to provide additional information for comparative purposes to our peers we also utilize value at risk to model the estimate of potential loss of financial derivative instruments included in derivative instruments valuation assets and liabilities. This estimation includes those energy contracts accounted for as a hedge under SFAS No. 133, as amended. The estimated maximum potential loss in fair value of the financial derivative instruments calculated using the diversified VAR model as of December 31, 2004 is $17.6 million. Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as value at risk, the relative immaturity of the competitive markets for electricity and related derivatives, and the seasonality of changes in market prices, the value at risk calculation may not capture the full extent of commodity price exposure. Additionally, actual changes in the value of options may differ from the value at risk calculated using a linear approximation inherent in our calculation method. As a result, actual changes in the fair value of mark to market energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated value at risk, and such changes could have a material impact on our financial results. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through our issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument. Our risk management policy allows us to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations. As of December 31, 2004, we had various interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling approximately $1.3 billion. If the swaps had been discontinued on December 31, 2004, we would have owed the counter parties approximately $35.6 million. Based on the investment grade rating of the counter parties, we believe that our exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by the counter parties to our hedging contracts is insignificant. We have both long and short term debt instruments that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2004, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a $5.7 million change in interest expense. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of our long term debt was $3.9 billion, compared with the carrying amount of $3.8 billion. We estimate that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of our long term debt by $76.3 million. Currency Exchange Risk We expect to continue to be subject to currency risks associated with foreign denominated distributions from our international investments. In the normal course of business, we may receive distributions denomi 95 Table of Contents nated in the Euro, Australian Dollar, British Pound and the Brazilian Real. We have historically engaged in a strategy of hedging foreign denominated cash flows through a program of matching currency inflows and outflows, and to the extent required, fixing the U.S. Dollar equivalent of net foreign denominated distributions with currency forward and swap agreements with highly credit worthy financial institutions. We would expect to enter into similar transactions in the future if management believes it to be appropriate. As of December 31, 2004, neither we, nor any of our consolidating subsidiaries, had any outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts. Credit Risk Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non performance or non payment by counter parties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. We monitor and manage the credit risk of NRG Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries through credit policies which include an (i) established credit approval process, (ii) daily monitoring of counter party credit limits, (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, credit derivatives or prepayment arrangements, (iv) the use of payment netting agreements and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counter party. Risks surrounding counter party performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. We have credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if necessary. As of December 31, 2004, we held collateral support of $155.5 million from counterparties. Additionally NRG has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, energy marketing and trading companies and regional transmission operators. These concentrations of counter parties may impact NRGs overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that counter parties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory and other conditions.
