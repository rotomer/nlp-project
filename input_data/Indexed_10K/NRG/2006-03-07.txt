Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction and Overview NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG Energy, the Company, we, our, or us is a wholesale power generation company, primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of power generation facilities, the transacting in and trading of fuel and transportation services and the marketing and trading of energy, capacity and related products in the United States and internationally. We have a diverse portfolio of electric generation facilities in terms of geography, fuel type and dispatch levels. As of the close of the Acquisition, our principal domestic generation assets consist of a diversified mix of natural gas , coal , oil fired and nuclear facilities, representing approximately 45%, 34%, 16% and 5% of our total domestic generation capacity, respectively. In addition, 10% of our domestic generating facilities have dual or multiple fuel capacity, which allows plants to dispatch with the lowest cost fuel option. In this discussion and analysis, we will discuss and explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for NRG during 2005 that will include the points below: Factors which affect our business, Our earnings and costs in the periods presented, Changes in earnings and costs between periods, Sources of earnings, Impact of these factors on our overall financial condition, A discussion of known trends, including the expected impact of the Texas Genco Acquisition, that will affect our future results of operations and financial condition, Expected future expenditures for capital projects, and Expected sources of cash for future operations and capital expenditures. As you read this discussion and analysis, refer to our Consolidated Statements of Income, which present the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the period of December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 and for the period of January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. We analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of our Consolidated Statements of Income. However, it is important to note that the historical financial information does not include any results of operation or the financial condition of Texas Genco. We have organized our discussion and analysis as follows: First, we discuss our strategy. We then describe the business environment in which we operate including how regulation, weather, and other factors affect our business. We highlight significant events that are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. We then review our results of operations discussing: An overview of our total company results, followed by a more detailed review of those results by operating segment. Known trends that will affect our results of operations in the future. We review our financial condition addressing: Our sources and uses of cash, credit ratings, capital resources and requirements, commitments, and off balance sheet arrangements. Known trends that will affect our financial condition in the future. 76 Table of Contents Next, we discuss our critical accounting policies. These are the accounting policies that are most important to both the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgment. Our Strategy Our strategy is to optimize the value of our generation assets while using that asset base as a platform for enhanced financial performance which can be sustained and expanded upon in years to come. We plan to maintain and enhance our position as a leading wholesale power generation company in the United States in a cost effective and risk mitigating manner in order to serve the bulk power requirements of our customer base and other entities that offer load, or otherwise consume wholesale electricity products and services in bulk. Our strategy includes the following elements: Increase value from our existing assets. We have a highly diversified portfolio of power generation assets in terms of region, fuel type and dispatch levels. We will continue to focus on extracting value from our portfolio by improving plant performance, reducing costs and harnessing our advantages of scale in the procurement of fuels: a strategy that we have branded FORNRG, or Focus on ROIC@NRG. Pursue intrinsic growth opportunities at existing sites in our core regions. We are favorably positioned to pursue growth opportunities through expansion of our existing generating capacity. We intend to invest in our existing assets through plant improvements, repowering and brownfield development to meet anticipated regional requirements for new capacity. We expect that these efforts will provide more efficient energy, lower our delivered cost, expand our electricity production capability and improve our ability to dispatch economically across all sections of the merit order, including baseload, intermediate and peaking generation. Maintain financial strength and flexibility. We remain focused on increasing cash flow and maintaining liquidity and balance sheet strength in order to ensure continued access to capital for growth; enhancing risk adjusted returns; and providing flexibility in executing our business strategy. We will continue our focus on maintaining operational and financial controls designed to ensure that our financial position remains strong. Reduce the volatility of our cash flows through asset based commodity hedging activities. We will continue to execute asset based risk management, hedging, marketing and trading strategies within well defined risk and liquidity guidelines in order to manage the value of our physical and contractual assets. Our marketing and hedging philosophy is centered on generating stable returns from our portfolio of power generation assets while preserving the ability to capitalize on strong spot market conditions and to capture the extrinsic value of our portfolio. We believe that we can successfully execute this strategy by taking advantage of our expertise in marketing power and ancillary services, our knowledge of markets, our flexible financial structure and our diverse portfolio of power generation assets. Participate in continued industry consolidation. We will continue to pursue selective acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures to enhance our asset mix and competitive position in our core regions to meet the fuel and dispatch requirements in these regions. We intend to concentrate on acquisition and joint venture opportunities that present attractive risk adjusted returns. We will also opportunistically pursue other strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions or divestitures during the consolidation of the power generation industry in the United States. Business Environment General Industry This past year, the energy and power sector has been shaken by significant events and change. These have shifted the industrys focus toward more efficient energy and fuel management, infrastructure developmental needs, and scope and scale merits. Those events include: Hurricanes Katrina and Rita exacerbated an already tight national natural gas production and delivery system during record summer demand. This led to significant price spikes and volatility across all fuel sources, which in turn spurred regulatory concerns over excessive burdens on retail consumers and 77 Table of Contents renewed interest by incumbent utilities in securing long term power supplies that are not tied to the price of natural gas. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, or EPAct, the most comprehensive energy legislation in more than a decade, was enacted in August 2005. EPAct reinforces FERC oversight and monitoring responsibilities and encourages the development of regulatory framework that provide the appropriate market signals for increased infrastructure investment including generation. While financial and strategic buyers continue to participate in energy sector asset sales and acquisitions, there has been renewed interest within the power sector for scope and scale and renewed merger and acquisitions activities by existing owners of power generation. This year has also seen regulated utilities seeking to participate in the competitive markets through outright combinations with deregulated entities. The EPA released its CAIR and CAMR guidelines in March. While there continues to be uncertainty as to the implementation standards by certain states, these environmental requirements coupled with potential improved scrubber technologies provide additional clarity with respect to longer term compliance strategies that will drive higher capital expenditure programs towards the end of the decade for many energy providers. There has been contentious but continued progress towards capacity markets evolution in order to meet increasing demand and encourage new investment in transmission and generation in load pockets around the country, including New England and California. Competition Wholesale power generation is a capital intensive, commodity driven business with numerous industry participants. We compete on the basis of the location of our plants and owning multiple plants in our regions, which increases the stability and reliability of our energy supply. Wholesale power generation is fundamentally a local business which, at present, is highly fragmented (relative to other commodity industries) and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies we compete against from market to market. Regulatory Matters As an operator of power plants and a participant in wholesale energy markets, we are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These include FERC, NRC, PUCT and certain state public utility commissions in which our generating assets are located. In addition, we are also subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO markets in which we participate. The plant operations of, and wholesale electric sales from our Texas assets are not currently subject to regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulations by PUCT as well as to regulation by the NRC with respect to its ownership interest in the STP. Weather Weather conditions in the different regions of the United States influence the financial results of our business. Weather conditions can affect the supply of and demand for electricity and fuels. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot market and the forward market, which may affect our results in any given period. Typically, demand for electricity and its price are higher in the summer and the winter, when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas and oil are higher in the winter. However, all regions of North America typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus we are not typically exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of our business at once. Other Factors A number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for our business. These factors include: seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand, extreme peak demands, available supply resources, transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions, 78 Table of Contents location of our generating facilities relative to the location of our load serving opportunities, procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions, and changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in: weather conditions, market liquidity, capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems, local transportation systems, and the nature and extent of electricity deregulation. Environmental Matters and Legal Proceedings We discuss details of our environmental matters in Item 15 Note 27 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1 Business Environmental Matters section. We discuss details of our legal proceedings in Item 15 Note 25 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of this information is about costs that may be material to our financial results. Impact of inflation on our results Unless discussed specifically in the relevant segment, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the period of December 6 through December 31, 2003 and the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 the impact of inflation and changing prices (due to changes in exchange rates) on our revenue and income from continuing operations was immaterial. Results of Operations Note: These historical results do not include the results of Texas Genco, and therefore represent the results of NRG Energy, Inc.s consolidated results only for the periods presented. 79 Table of Contents The following table provides operating income by segment for the year ended December 31, 2005: Reorganized NRG For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 South Other North Northeast Central Western America Australia All Other Total (In millions, except MWh, CDD and HDD data) Energy revenue $ 1,444 $ 330 $ 1 $ 11 $ 144 $ 84 $ 2,014 Capacity revenue 291 186 5 81 563 Hedging & risk management activity (285 ) (1 ) 43 (5 ) (248 ) Alternative revenue 2 189 191 O&M fees 20 20 Other revenue 104 37 (3 ) 25 5 168 Operating revenues 1,554 552 1 15 212 374 2,708 Cost of energy 871 368 1 14 93 182 1,529 Derivative cost of energy (2 ) (2 ) Other operating expenses(1) 393 104 5 16 99 121 738 Depreciation and amortization 74 61 1 7 27 24 194 Operating income/ (loss) 218 20 (6 ) (28 ) (7 ) 41 238 MWh sold(2) (in thousands) 16,128 11,710 6 77 5,495 Market indicators: Average natural gas price Henry Hub ($/MMbtu) $ 8.89 Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 91.98 $ 69.96 $ 71.06 $ 63.76 Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(3) 1,604 2,825 776 970 CDDs 30 year rolling average 1,073 2,449 704 708 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(3) 10,449 1,638 2,563 5,095 HDDs 30 year rolling average 10,479 1,888 2,790 5,436 (1) Other operating expenses include Cost of majority owned operations and General, administrative and development expenses, excluding cost of energy.

This increase in power prices drove the net mark to market losses of $119 million primarily associated with forward financial electric sales in support of our Northeast assets. As compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, on peak electricity prices increased between 43% to 53% in the various markets we operate, whereas our total domestic coal costs, which are largely contracted, increased only 17% increasing our dark spreads. Gas and oil prices increased 50% and 49%, respectively, resulting in higher spark spreads, but compressed oil margins as compared to the same period last year(1) Total generation increased for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 by 5%. We began selling excess emission allowances, and have recognized a net gain of $31 million during 2005. Forced outages at our Huntley, Dunkirk, Indian River and Big Cajun II plants during 2005 negatively impacted our generation by 2.4 million MWh. We repurchased $645 million in aggregate principal amount of our Second Priority Notes, resulting in $45 million of refinancing charges. We sold a number of non core assets including, Enfield, our Northbrook assets and our remaining Kendall interest for a total of $106 million in proceeds and a net gain of approximately $32 million. We announced the signing of a sale agreement for Rocky Road resulting in an impairment charge of $20 million. We wrote down our interest in the Saguaro Power Company by $27 million. Consolidated Discussion: Revenues from Majority Owned Operations Revenues from majority owned operations were $2,708 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $2,348 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $360 million. Energy revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $649 million from $1,365 million to $2,014 million. Of the $2,014 million, 87% were merchant as compared to 70% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in energy revenues versus 2004 was driven by both increased prices and the increased merchant generation from our Northeast assets. Energy revenues from our domestic coal assets increased by $314 million, all due to increased power prices, as generation from our domestic coal assets decreased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004. This decrease in generation was due to both planned and unplanned outages at Huntley, Indian River, and Big Cajun II during the second and fourth quarters, and the time we typically perform outage work. Energy revenue from our gas assets in New York City increased by $176 million, including $23 million in NYISO final settlement payments. Of the remaining $153 million, both price and generation nearly equally contributed to the increase. Energy revenues from our oil fired assets rose by $211 million, 86% due to higher volumes following an increase in summer demand as the generation from these assets increased by 122% for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004. Additionally, a one time payment of $39 million from the Connecticut Light and Power settlement contributed to energy revenue during the second quarter of 2004. Capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $563 million compared to $612 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a reduction of $49 million. Capacity revenues were unfavorable versus last year due to the loss of $56 million capacity revenues from the Kendall facility, which was sold in the fourth 1 Per the Henry Hub gas price index published by Platts Gas Daily. 84 Table of Contents quarter of 2004, and the expiration of the Rockford tolling agreement in May 2005 which reduced year on year results by $23 million. Capacity revenues from our western New York plants decreased by $10 million due to the addition of new generation and increased imports in New York, which depressed capacity prices for our assets in the western New York market during the first half of 2005. This loss was offset by a $44 million increase in capacity revenues from our Connecticut assets. This increase is related to the additional $24 million capacity revenues recorded in 2005 related to our Connecticut RMR settlement agreement. Alternative revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $191 million and $175 million, respectively. Increased generation due to the hotter weather this summer and an increase in contract rates from our Thermal and Resource Recovery operations positively impacted the alternative revenues results. Other revenues include emission allowance sales, natural gas sales, Fresh Start related contract amortization, and expense recovery revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2005, other revenues totaled a $168 million compared to $98 million of other revenues for the same period in 2004. The increase is due to higher emission allowance revenues, higher physical gas sales and lower contract amortization, offset by lower expense recovery revenues. Please see our discussion below as to our emission allowance position and sales. The increase in other revenues was also attributed to $33 million in higher gas sales. The increase in gas sales is primarily related to a new gas sale agreement entered into in the third quarter of 2005 by the South Central region, where revenues from gas sales increased by $23 million. We entered into this agreement in conjunction with power purchase agreements to minimize our market purchases during peak months. Lower contract amortization of $30 million is related to contracts rolling off over the course of time. Finally, during the year ended December 31, 2005, expense recovery revenues were $29 million lower versus the comparable period in 2004. Expense recovery revenues are associated with our Connecticut RMR agreements and we reached our maximum payment under that agreement during the first quarter of 2005. Sale of Excess SO2 Emission Allowances We actively manage our surplus emission allowance position. During the later half of 2005, we began trading a portion of our excess SO2 emission allowances to third parties. Revenues from the sale of emission allowances to third parties net of purchases totaled $31 million in 2005, excluding the EPA auction results. The following table provides the sales activity and our balance of emission allowances (excluding Texas Genco) for vintage years, through 2009: Average Tons Sales Price Revenue Balance of NRG SO 2 Emissions Credits Allowances, as of December 31, 2004 897,653 n/a n/a Sales during 2005 35,052 $ 889 $ 31 million Consumed (115,810 ) Balance of NRG SO 2 Emissions Credits Allowances, as of December 31, 2005 746,791 n/a n/a Completed Sales between January 1 and February 28, 2006 46,077 $ 1,180 $ 54 million Balance of NRG SO 2 Emissions Credits Allowances, as of February 28, 2006 700,714 n/a n/a In addition to our SO2 emission allowance balances presented above, after the closing of the acquisition of Texas Genco, the combined NRG balance of excess SO2 emissions allowances for vintage years through 2009 is 1,329,066 tons on February 28, 2006. We expect to continue the active management of our SO2 emission allowances in excess of our forecast generation needs. 85 Table of Contents Hedging and Risk Management Activity For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 South Other North Northeast Central Western America Australia All Other Total (In millions) Net gains/ (losses) on settled positions, or financial revenues $ (132 ) $ (1 ) $ $ $ 35 $ (5 ) $ (103 ) Mark to market results Reversal of previously recognized unrealized (gains)/losses on settled positions (59 ) 1 (58 ) Net unrealized gains/ (losses) on open positions related to economic hedges (119 ) 7 (112 ) Net unrealized gains/ (losses) on open positions related to trading activity 27 27 Subtotal mark to market results (151 ) 8 (143 ) Total derivative gain/ (loss) $ (283 ) $ (1 ) $ $ $ 43 $ (5 ) $ (246 ) Hedging and Risk Management Activity The total derivative loss for the year was approximately $246 million, comprised of $103 million in financial revenue losses and $143 million of mark to market losses. The $103 million loss of financial revenues represent the settled value for the year of all financial instruments including but not limited to financial swaps on power. Of the $143 million of mark to market losses, $112 million represents the change in fair value of forward sales of electricity and fuel $114 million losses associated with electricity sales and $2 million gain associated with cost of fuel, the reversal of $58 million of mark to market gains which ultimately settled as financial revenues and $27 million mark to market gain related to trading activity. These activities primarily support our Northeast assets. The $112 million domestic loss related to forward sales during 2005 compares to a $59 million gain for the same period during 2004. Since our economic hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk of commodity price movements on revenues and cost of energy sold, the changes in such results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather taken together with the effects of pricing and cost changes on energy revenues and costs of energy. In the fourth quarter of 2004 and over the course of 2005, we hedged much of our calendar year 2005 and 2006 Northeast generation. Since that time and during the third quarter 2005 in particular, the settled and forward prices of electricity rose, driven by the extreme weather conditions this summer. While this increase in electricity prices benefited our generation portfolio versus last year with higher energy revenues, it is also the reason for the mark to market recognition of the forward sales and the settlement of positions as losses. In addition to the hedging techniques used until now, we expect to utilize hedging strategies that are option based with a goal of establishing a floor on earnings, leaving upside market participation, minimizing mark to market swings and optimizing collateral support of our hedging program. For 2007, we have already locked in a floor on 30% of our baseload coal generation at current forward prices while preserving our ability to benefit from further upward movement in northeastern electricity prices. Cost of Majority Owned Operations Cost of majority owned operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $2,067 million. Cost of majority owned operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $1,489 million or 63% of revenues from majority owned operations. The increase is related to the cost of energy, which increased by $521 million, to $1,529 million or 56% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $1,008 million or 43% of revenues for the same period in 2004. The increase in the cost of energy as a percentage of revenues is driven by the higher mark to market loss in revenues, by both higher price and generation in the Northeast region and higher purchased energy and gas sales in the South Central region. Total gas costs increased by $163 million, $124 million in the New York City assets alone. Of the increase at our New York City assets, $15 million was due to increased gas purchases for resale, with approximately $67 million due to increased generation. The 86 Table of Contents South Central regions gas costs increased by $25 million due to physical gas purchases related to a new gas sale agreement entered into in the third quarter of 2005 to support certain tolling arrangements. Total oil costs for the company increased by $165 million, 65% due to increased generation from our oil fired assets, and the remainder due to an increase in price. Total coal costs increased by $71 million. The increase at our domestic coal fired assets is solely due to price increases, as overall generation from our coal fired assets decreased for the year ended December 31, 2005 by 5% as compared to the same period in 2004 due to the planned and forced outages at our Huntley, Indian River and Big Cajun II facilities. The increase in coal prices is related to new low sulfur coal and rail contracts which became effective in April 2005. Additionally, our Indian River plant uses a higher portion of eastern coal that experienced a significant cost increase in 2005. We have increased our percentage blend of low sulfur coal over the year as compared to the same period last year. This had the effect of mitigating the increase in coal and coal transportation costs as low sulfur coal prices have not increased as much as regular coal prices. Total purchased energy increased by $112 million due to increases at our South Central region. Higher long term contract load demand due to the extreme weather, a 100 MW around the clock sale to Entergy, a tolling agreement, and the forced outages during the second quarter, required South Central to purchase energy to meet its contract load obligations. Other Operating Expenses during 2005 totaled $737 million versus $693 million in the comparable period of 2004, an increase of $44 million. This increase is driven by a $51 million, or 11%, increase in operating and maintenance costs. Major maintenance projects and more extensive outages in 2005, as compared to 2004, contributed $33 million to the increase. The low sulfur coal conversions and turbine overhauls of the western New York plants and Indian River plant was a main focus for many of the major maintenance and outages in 2005. South Central also went through a significant outage to install a low NOX burner on one of its units and an additional outage was completed this Fall to address reliability issues experienced at the Big Cajun II unit earlier in the year. Normal maintenance increased by $9 million or 9% due to the increased run time at our plants this summer. Additionally, in 2004, a settlement with a third party vendor regarding auxiliary power charges reduced 2004 operating and maintenance expenses by $7 million. Depreciation and Amortization Our depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $194 million and $208 million, respectively. The decrease in depreciation and amortization from 2005 to 2004 is due to the 2004 sale of our Kendall plant, which contributed approximately $14 million in depreciation and amortization expense during 2004. General, Administrative and Development Our G&A costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $197 million compared to $210 million for the same period in 2004, a decrease of $13 million. Corporate costs represent $94 million or 3% of revenues and $113 million or 5% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. G&A costs have been favorably impacted by $11 million in reduced bad debt expense associated with notes receivable from third parties. Additionally, external consulting expenses decreased in 2005 as compared to 2004 by approximately $11 million primarily related to reduced tax and legal consulting. These favorable impacts were offset by a $5 million increase in information technology related expenses primarily associated with increased compliance costs related to Sarbanes Oxley and the relocation from Minneapolis. Corporate Relocation Charges During the year ended December 31, 2005, charges related to our corporate relocation activities were approximately $6 million as compared to $16 million in 2004. Included in this years charges is approximately $3 million related to the lease abandonment charges associated with our former Minneapolis office with the remainder related to the relocation, recruitment and transition costs. In 2004, we recorded $16 million primarily related to employee severance and termination benefits and employee related transition costs. We completed the physical move of our relocation in 2004 when the majority of costs were incurred. We do not expect any material relocation charges in 2006. 87 Table of Contents Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates During the year ended December 31, 2005, equity earnings from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates were $104 million compared to $160 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $56 million. Our earnings in WCP accounted for $22 million and $69 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in WCPs equity earnings is due to the expiration of the CDWR contract in December 2004. Enfields equity earnings were $13 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004. We sold our investment in Enfield on April 1, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005 results for Enfield include approximately $12 million of unrealized gains associated with mark to market increases in the fair value of energy related derivative instruments, as compared to $23 million of unrealized gain for the same period of 2004. Other equity investments included in the 2005 results include MIBRAG and Gladstone which comprised $26 million and $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, respectively. For the comparable period in 2004, MIBRAG and Gladstone earned $21 million and $18 million, respectively. MIBRAGs equity earnings for 2004 were negatively impacted by an outage at our Schkopau plant; additionally, MIBRAG recorded a lower asset retirement obligation in 2005 as compared to 2004. Gladstones earnings in 2005 were greater than 2004 due to lower major maintenance expense and an approximate $1 million recovery in business interruption insurance. Write Downs and Gains/(Losses) on Sales of Equity Method Investments During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a $31 million loss due to the sale and impairment of certain equity investments as we continued to divest of non core assets. On April 1, 2005, we sold our 25% interest in Enfield, resulting in net pre tax proceeds of $65 million and a pre tax gain of $12 million, including the post closing working capital adjustments. In 2005, we also sold our interest in Kendall for $5 million in net pre tax proceeds and a pre tax gain of approximately $4 million. These gains on sales were offset by approximately $47 million in impairment charges recorded this year. In December 2005, we executed an agreement with Dynegy to sell our 50% interest in Rocky Road LLC in conjunction with our purchase of Dynegys 50% interest in WCP. Based on this arms length transaction rendering the fair value of our investment in Rocky Road at $45 million, we subsequently impaired our investment to this fair value by an approximate write down of $20 million. We expect to close the sale of our interest of Rocky Road during the first half of 2006. We also recorded an impairment of $27 million on our investment in Saguaro. With the expiration of its gas supply contract, Saguaro began recording operating losses during the second half of 2005, triggering a permanent write down to NRGs investment value in Saguaro. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we sold our Loy Yang investment which resulted in a $1 million loss, our interest in Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership for a $5 million loss, and several NEO investments for a $4 million loss. These losses were offset by a $1 million gain associated with the sale of Calpine Cogeneration. Also during 2004, we recorded a $7 million impairment charge on our investment in James River LLC based on an estimated sale value from a prospective buyer. Other Income, net Other income had a net increase of $35 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004. Other income in 2005 was favorably impacted by a $14 million gain from the settlement related to our TermoRio project in Brazil and a gain of approximately $4 million related to the resolution of a contingency from the sale of a former project, the Crockett Cogeneration Facility, which was sold in 2002. Other income was also favorably impacted by $14 million of higher interest income related to more efficient management of our cash balances. These favorable results were offset by a $3 million reserve relating to the ongoing TermoRio litigation. 88 Table of Contents Refinancing expense Refinancing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $56 million and $72 million, respectively. During 2005, as part of our continuing effort to manage our capital structure, we redeemed and purchased a total of $645 million of our Second Priority Notes. As a result of the redemption and purchases, we incurred $55 million in premiums and write offs of deferred financing costs. Our Australia region also refinanced its project debt for better terms, resulting in the write off of approximately $10 million of debt premium, i.e. refinancing income. We also incurred an additional $11 million in refinancing fees during 2005 related to the amortization of a bridge loan commitment fee that we paid related to the Acquisition of Texas Genco. As part of our new financing in 2006 in conjunction with the acquisition of Texas Genco, we paid a bridge loan commitment fee of approximately $45 million to ensure that we would have the proper financing in place for the said acquisition. This amount is being amortized over time, and during 2005 we amortized approximately $11 million to refinancing expense. The remaining balance of this amount will be expensed during the first quarter of 2006 as we finalized the new financings related to the acquisition of Texas Genco. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we refinanced certain amounts of our term loans with additional corporate level high yield notes for better terms, which resulted in $15 million of prepayment penalties and a $15 million write off of deferred financing costs. Additionally, we refinanced our senior credit facility in December 2004 and recorded $14 million of prepayment penalties and a $27 million of write off of deferred financing costs. Interest expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $197 million as compared to $266 million for the same period in 2004, a reduction of $69 million. Interest expense was favorably impacted by the sale of Kendall which incurred $25 million of interest expense year ended December 31, 2004. Additionally, the refinancing of our Senior Credit Facility on December 23, 2004 lowered our interest rate by 212.5 basis points and the $645 million redemption and purchases of our Second Priority Notes during 2005 reduced interest expense on our corporate debt by approximately $50 million. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was approximately $43 million and approximately $65 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The overall effective tax rate was 35.8% and 28.7% for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to the earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, rendering an effective tax rate of 17.3% and 9.7%, respectively, on foreign income. Our 2005 domestic income tax effective rate increased due to our gain on the sale of Enfield and the taxable dividend received pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Also see our tax rate reconciliation disclosure in Note 22, Income Taxes, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The effective tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and the adjustment of valuation allowances in accordance with SFAS 109. These factors and others, including our history of pre tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets. Income from Discontinued Operations, net of Income Taxes During the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded a gain from discontinued operations of $7 million and $25 million, respectively, as we continued to divest certain non core assets. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 consist of Audrain, the Northbrook New York and Northbrook Energy assets and various expenses related to the final settlements of McClain. During the year ended December 31, 2004, discontinued operations consisted of the results of Audrain, the two Northbrook 89 Table of Contents entities, McClain, Penobscot Energy Recovery Company, or PERC, Compania Boliviana De Energia Electrica S.A. Bolivian Power Company Limited, or Cobee, Hsin Yu, LSP Energy (Batesville) and four NEO Corporation projects (NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO Prima Deshecha and NEO Tajiguas LLC). With the exception of Audrain, Northbrook New York and Northbrook Energy, all discontinued operations were sold prior to December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2005, the sale of Audrain is still pending and remains subject to regulatory approvals. Amerens application to assume certain obligations of Audrain is pending before the Missouri Public Service Commission .. The case filed with the FERC seeking authorization for the transaction pursuant to section 203 of the Federal Power Act has been protested by the Missouri Joint Municipal Electric Utility Commission. The pre merger waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act expired January 19, 2006. Despite the above, we still expect to close this sale during the first half of 2006. Regional Discussion Northeast Region Results Operating Income For the year ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Northeast region was $218 million, as compared to $318 million for the same period in 2004, a decrease of $100 million. This decrease is due to $119 million net MTM losses reported by the Northeast associated with forward sales of electricity as compared to a $59 million net MTM gain booked in 2004. Excluding net MTM losses or gains, the Northeast operating income increased by $52 million. This increase was largely due to increased power prices, wider dark spread margins, and increased generation from the Northeast gas and oil assets. With higher than average temperatures this summer, on peak electricity prices increased 43% to 52% as compared to 2004, while gas and oil prices increased 50% and 49%(1) Spark spreads on our gas and coal margins widened, while oil margins were compressed compared to the same period last year. The Northeasts New York City assets benefited from the increased spark spreads as they increased their generation output by 52% versus last year, from 1.1 million MWh to 1.7 million MWh due to increased summer demand. Generation from our Northeast oil fired assets increased by 122%, but oil margins decreased by 25% versus 2004, as our cost per MWh increased by 29% in comparison to the same period in 2004 due to an offsetting increase in oil prices. Revenues Revenues from our Northeast region totaled $1,554 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $1,251 million for the same period in 2004, an increase of $303 million. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included $1,444 million in energy revenues compared to $853 million for the same period in 2004. Of this $591 million increase, $183 million can be attributed to our New York City assets. Due to outages of local competitors and extreme heat this summer, sold generation from our New York City assets increased by 52% for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004. Excluding the $23 million of final NYISO settlement payments, increased generation accounted for 49% of the increase in NYC energy revenues. Our oil fired assets earned $211 million more in energy revenues, and increased generation 122% during 2005 as compared to 2004; 86% of the increased energy revenues were due to increased generation. Our coal assets recorded higher energy revenues of $99 million due solely to higher power prices as generation from our coal assets had a minimal decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005. Capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $291 million compared to $265 million for the same period in 2004. Capacity revenues were favorable versus the last year due to $24 million additional capacity revenues recorded during the second quarter of 2005 in conjunction with our Connecticut RMR settlement agreement approved by FERC on January 22, 2005. These settlement revenues were offset, however, by lower capacity revenues from our western New York plants. Capacity prices in western New York were negatively impacted by the addition of new capacity supply and increased imports into the state. 1Per the Henry Hub gas price index published by Platts Gas Daily. 90 Table of Contents Other revenues include emission credit sales, natural gas sales, Fresh Start related contract amortization, and expense recovery revenues and totaled $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $75 million the same period in 2004, an increase of $29 million. This increase is related to the additional $43 million in emission allowance sales to both external parties and inter company sales. In addition, other revenues increased from $6 million in higher gas sales, and $6 million in lower contract amortization as the contracts have rolled off over time. Other revenues were adversely impacted by $29 million in lower expense recovery revenues related to the Connecticut RMR agreement. We reached our maximum payment under that agreement during the first quarter of 2005. Hedging and Risk Management Activity The total derivative loss for the year was $283 million, comprised of $132 million in financial revenue losses and $151 million of mark to market losses. The $132 million loss of financial revenues represent the settled value for the year of all financial instruments including financial swaps and options on power. Of the $151 million of mark to market losses, $119 million represents fair value of forward sales of electricity and fuel $121 million losses associated with electricity sales and $2 million gain associated with cost of fuel, the reversal of $59 million of mark to market gains which ultimately settled as financial revenues and $27 million mark to market gain related to trading activity. These activities primarily support our Northeast assets. Since hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk of commodity price movements on revenues and cost of energy sold, the changes in such results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather taken together with the effects of pricing and cost changes on energy revenues and costs of energy. In the fourth quarter of 2004 and over the course of 2005, we hedged much of our calendar year 2005 and 2006 Northeast generation. Since that time and during the third quarter 2005 in particular, the settled and forward prices of electricity rose, driven by the extreme weather conditions this summer. While this increase in electricity prices benefited our generation portfolio versus last year with higher energy revenues, it is also the reason for the mark to market recognition of the forward sales and the settlement of positions as losses. Cost of energy Cost of energy increased by $350 million for our Northeast region for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. Oil fuel costs in our Northeast region increased by $162 million, where 65% of the increase was due to increased generation. The Northeasts gas fuel costs increased by $129 million. Higher gas sales from our New York City assets drove $15 million of the increase, with $109 million of the increase related to higher prices and demand for our NYC assets. Coal costs increased by $61 million, due to increased prices, although our coal fired generation in the Northeast had a minimal decrease during 2005 as compared to 2004, specifically due to scheduled and unplanned outages at our western New York and Indian River facilities during the second and fourth quarters. Of the $61 million increase in coal cost, 71% was due to increases at our Indian River plant. Our Indian River plant uses a higher portion of eastern coal, whose price experienced a significant cost increase during 2005. Other Operating Expenses Other operating costs for our Northeast region increased by $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. This increase was driven by operating and maintenance costs, led by higher major maintenance costs. The low sulfur conversion projects continued at our Western New York plants and began at our Indian River plant this year and major outages related to turbine overhauls took place at our Western New York and Indian River plants. The increased number and extensiveness of the outages contributed to the $14 million increase in major maintenance expense this year. Additionally, in 2004, a settlement with a third party vendor regarding auxiliary power charges reduced 2004 operating and maintenance expenses by $7 million. Other operating expenses for the Northeast region include the administrative regional office costs, other non income tax expense, insurance and corporate allocations. These costs increased by $30 million in 2005 compared to 2004, $14 million of which was due in non income tax expense as we recognized property tax credits in 2004. Additionally, regional office and corporate allocations also increased per our new allocation 91 Table of Contents methodology as discussed in Item 15 Note 21, Segment Reporting, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. South Central Region Results Operating Income For the year ended December 31, 2005, the South Central region realized operating income of $20 million, as compared to $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. During 2005, our Big Cajun II facility experienced several forced outages during the summer months, at which time contract demand and replacement power costs were at their highest. Generation for 2005 decreased by 6% from 10.6 million MWh to 9.9 million MWh versus the same period in 2004, with 0.2 million MWh lost due to forced outages. These outages contributed to the purchase of $114 million in additional purchased energy required to meet contract load following obligation in the merchant market at costs higher than our coal based generating assets. In addition, during 2005, South Central had three planned outages versus one major planned outage during 2004, which increased major maintenance by $16 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Revenues Revenues from our South Central region were $552 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $418 million for the same period in 2004, an increase of $134 million. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included $330 million in energy revenues, of which 62% were contracted. This compares to $219 million of energy revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, 73% of which were contracted. This increase of $111 million in energy revenues and the lower percentage contracted was due to increased merchant energy sales following higher power prices, favorable weather, and nuclear plant outages in the region. Also, a round the clock 100 MW sale to Entergy and a tolling agreement which at times provided power that could be resold at a higher price helped to boost merchant revenues. Other revenues include physical gas sales and Fresh Start related contract amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2005, other revenues totaled $37 million compared to $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, with the increase due to $23 million increase in physical gas sales related to a new gas sale agreement entered into in July 2005. We entered into this agreement in conjunction with power purchase agreements to minimize our market purchases during peak months. Cost of Energy South Centrals cost of energy increased by $145 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. Of this amount, $114 million is due to higher purchased energy costs. During 2005, our Big Cajun II facility experienced a number of forced outages, encountered high demand from the Regions long term contracts, and entered into 100 MW around the clock sale to Entergy, and a tolling agreement, all of which required the purchase of energy to meet contract load obligations. Purchased energy per MWh increased by 238% versus the same period in 2004. Additionally, due to the extreme weather conditions and increasing gas prices, the average purchased energy price increased $18.20 per MWh for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased by $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in 2004, with $16 million of the increase related to increased planned and unplanned outages at our Big Cajun II facility, and $13 million related to regional office and the new NRG allocation methodology discussed in Item 15 Note 21, Segment Reporting, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Western Region Results For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Western region realized an operating loss of $6 million, as compared to an operating loss of $9 million for the same period in 2004, a reduction of $3 million in our loss. 92 Table of Contents This reduction is due to the payment of CAISO penalties paid by our Red Bluff and Chowchilla facilities in 2004, offset by the expiration of the Red Bluff RMR contract as of December 31, 2004. Other North America Region Results For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Other North America region realized an operating loss of $28 million on revenues of $15 million, as compared to an operating loss of $5 million and revenues of $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This unfavorable variance is primarily related to the sale of Kendall and the expiration of a tolling agreement at our Rockford facility. Both Kendall and Rockford had operating income of $3 million each, for the year ended December 31, 2004 and revenues of $73 million and $15 million, respectively. Other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization for our Other North America region for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $16 million and $7 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2004, other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization were $42 million and $21 million, respectively. The favorable variance in both of these is due to the sale of Kendall. Australia Region Results Operating Income For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Australia region realized an operating loss of $7 million, as compared to an operating loss of $5 million for the same period in 2004. Unseasonably mild weather and weak pool prices in the first quarter drove the unfavorable results as compared to last year. Higher generation for the year ended December 31, 2005 helped to offset weak pool prices, with generation increasing 6% over 2004. Revenues Revenues from our Australia region totaled $212 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $181 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately $31 million, with $7 million as a result of the strengthening Australian dollar in 2005. Energy revenues decreased by $15 million primarily due to the weak pool prices experienced in the first quarter of the year. An unseasonably mild summer in Australia drove the average annualized pool price down to $23 per MWh from $30 per MWh in 2004, a reduction of 26%. This decrease was offset by $18 million of financial revenues, representing the settled value of financial instruments, including financial swaps on power, and $10 million of higher derivative revenues, representing the change in fair value of forward sales of electricity and fuel. Additionally, 5% higher generation due to fewer planned outage hours at the Osborne Power Station in 2005 and the full commercialization of the Playford station during the fourth quarter of 2004, helped to offset the impact of the lower pool prices. For the year ended December 31, 2005, other revenues totaled $25 million compared to $7 million of other revenues for the same period in 2004. Other revenues were favorably impacted by lower contract amortization of $15 million in 2005 as a significant contract was canceled in 2004. Cost of Energy Fuel costs increased by $14 million, with $10 million of this related to an 18% increase in purchased power from Osborne Power Station in 2005 and $3 million due to additional gas expenses to support these higher generation levels. These increased costs are offset by increased revenue from merchant electricity and gas sales in 2005 related to our Osborne plant. Fuel oil costs in 2005 were approximately $1 million higher due to a combination of increased world oil prices and increased starts at Playford. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for Australia for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $16 million over the same period in 2004. Operating and maintenance expense increased by $10 million in 2005 with $3 million attributable to the strengthening Australian dollar. Increased operational and maintenance costs relating to our Playford power station in addition to higher coal production costs to support the higher generation levels led to a further $2 million increase. Significant increases in world oil prices over the 2005 year resulted in $1 million of additional costs related to coal mining and delivery. Labor costs at Flinders 93 Table of Contents were up approximately $1 million, a combination of increasing provision levels for workers compensation claims and increased charges relating to pension charges. Additionally, due to the new NRG allocations methodology as discussed in Item 15 Note 21, Segment Reporting, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Australia region incurred $6 million in higher corporate allocations as compared to 2004. For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net Income Reorganized NRG For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded net income of $186 million, or $1.85 per weighted average share of diluted common stock. These favorable results occurred despite a challenging market environment in 2004. Unseasonably mild weather, high volatility on forward markets and disappointing spot power prices summarize 2004s events. The NOAA has ranked the mean average temperatures over the past 110 years by season for each of the lower 48 states. The year 2004 started with the winter being colder than normal in the east coast followed by a spring, summer and fall which were among the mildest in the last 110 years throughout most of the United States. Although mild weather in the North America market kept spot market on peak power prices were low throughout most of the year, relatively high gas and oil prices kept spark spreads on coal based assets positive. The overall perception that there would be significant production losses due to Hurricane Ivan ignited a strong pre heating season rally in natural gas futures during the early fourth quarter. While power prices tracked changes in natural gas prices, this movement was not one for one. As a result, our spark spreads on coal based generation increased dramatically with the fall 2004 changes in gas prices. During this period we sold forward 2005 power locking in these spark spreads. Forward power prices have fallen considerably from the highs set in October, and many of those forward sales, which were marked to market through earnings, significantly contributed to the $57 million unrealized gain recorded in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 and as more fully described in Item 15 Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The majority of the unrealized gains relate to forward sales of electricity which were realized in 2005. These gains were offset by our South Central regions results, which were negatively impacted by an unplanned outage in the fourth quarter forcing us to purchase power to meet our contract supply obligations. Our results were also favorably impacted by the FERC approved settlement agreement between NRG Energy and Connecticut Light & Power, or CL&P, and others concerning the congestion and losses obligation associated with a prior standard offer service contract, whereby we received $38 million in settlement proceeds in July 2004. The 2004 results were also positively impacted by $160 million in equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates including $69 million from our interest in West Coast Power which benefited from warmer than normal temperatures during the year. Impairment charges of $45 million negatively impacted net income; of which $27 million relates to the Kendall asset. During the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, we recognized net income of $11 million or $0.11 per share of common stock. From an overall operational perspective our facilities were profitable during this period. Our results were adversely impacted by our having to continue to satisfy the standard offer service contract that we entered into with CL&P in 2000. As a result of our inability to terminate this contract during our bankruptcy proceeding, we continued to be exposed to losses under this contract. These losses were incurred, as we were unable to satisfy the requirements of this contract at a price/cost below the contracted sales price. Upon our adoption of Fresh Start, we recorded at fair value, all assets and liabilities on our opening balance sheet and accordingly we recorded as an obligation the fair value of the CL&P contract. During the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, we recognized as revenues the entire fair value of this contract effectively offsetting the actual losses incurred under this contract. The CL&P contract terminated on December 31, 2003. Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we recorded net income of $2.8 billion. Net income for the period is directly attributable to our emerging from bankruptcy and adopting the Fresh 94 Table of Contents Start provisions of SOP 90 7. Upon the confirmation of our Plan of Reorganization and our emergence from bankruptcy, we were able to remove significant amounts of long term debt and other pre petition obligations from our balance sheet. Accordingly, as part of net income, we recorded a net gain of $3.9 billion (comprised of a $4.2 billion gain from continuing operations and a $0.3 billion loss from discontinued operations) as the impact of our adopting Fresh Start in our statement of operations. $6 billion of this amount is directly related to the forgiveness of debt and settlement of substantial amounts of our pre petition obligations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. In addition to the removal of substantial amounts of pre petition debt and other obligations from our balance sheet, we also revalued our assets and liabilities to fair value. Accordingly, we substantially wrote down the value of our fixed assets. We recorded a net $1.6 billion charge related to the revaluation of our assets and liabilities within the Fresh Start Reporting adjustment line of our consolidated statement of operations. In addition to our adjustments related to our emergence from bankruptcy, we also recorded substantial charges related to other items such as the settlement of certain outstanding litigation in the amount of $463 million, write downs and losses on the sale of equity investments of $147 million, advisor costs and legal fees directly attributable to our being in bankruptcy of $198 million and $237 million of other asset impairment and restructuring costs incurred prior to our filing for bankruptcy. Net income for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 was favorably impacted by our not recording interest expense on substantial amounts of corporate level debt while we were in bankruptcy and by the continued favorable results experienced by our equity investments. Revenues from Majority Owned Operations Reorganized NRG Our revenues from majority owned operations were $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 which included $1.4 billion of energy revenues, $612 million of capacity revenues, $175 million of alternative energy revenues, $21 million of O&M fees, $76 million of hedging and risk management activities and $99 million other revenues. Revenues from majority owned operations for the year ended December 31, 2004, were driven primarily by our North American operations, primarily our Northeast facilities. Our wholly owned North America assets generated approximately 29 million MWh during the year 2004 with the Northeast region representing 46% of these MWhs. Of the total $1.4 billion in energy revenues, the Northeast region represented 62%. Our energy revenues were favorably impacted by the FERC approved settlement agreement between us and CL&P and others, whereby we received $38 million in settlement proceeds in July 2004. These settlement proceeds are included in the All Other segment in the energy revenue category. South Centrals energy revenues are driven by our ability to sell merchant energy, which is dependent upon available generation from our coal based Louisiana Generating company after serving our co op customer and long term customer load obligations. Since our load obligation is primarily residential load, our merchant opportunities are largely available in the off peak hours of the day. Our Australian operations were favorably impacted by strong market prices driven by gas restrictions in January, record high temperatures in February and March, and favorable foreign exchange movements. Our capacity revenues are largely driven by our Northeast and South Central facilities. Our South Central and New York City assets earned 30% and 26% of our total capacity revenues, respectively. In the Northeast, our Connecticut facilities continue to benefit from the cost based reliability must run, or RMR agreements, which were authorized by FERC as of January 17, 2004 and approved by FERC on January 27, 2005. The agreements entitle us to approximately $7 million of capacity revenues per month until January 1, 2006, the LICAP implementation date. In the South Central region, our long term contracts provide for capacity payments. Other North American capacity revenues were generated by our Kendall operation, which had a long term tolling agreement. During this period we also experienced a favorable impact on our revenues due to the mark to market on certain of our derivative contracts wherein we have recognized $57 million in unrealized gains. This gain is related to our Northeast assets and is included in the hedging and risk management activities. Included in Other Revenue in the Northeast are the cost reimbursement funds under the RMR agreement for our Connecticut assets. Our revenues during this period include net charges of $35 million of non cash amortization of the fair values of various executory contracts recorded on our balance sheet upon our adoption of the Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90 7 in December 2003. 95 Table of Contents Our revenues from majority owned operations were $137 million for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Predecessor Company Revenues from majority owned operations were $1.8 billion for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 and include approximately $910 million of energy revenues, $566 million of capacity revenues, $82 million of alternative energy, $13 million of O&M fees, $19 million of hedging and risk management activities and $208 million other revenues. Revenues from majority owned operations during the period ended December 5, 2003, were driven primarily by our North American operations and to a lesser degree by our international operations, primarily Australia. Our domestic Northeast and South Central power generation operations significantly contributed to our revenues due primarily to favorable market prices resulting from strong fuel and electricity prices. Our Australian operations were favorably impacted by foreign exchange rates. During this period we also experienced an unfavorable impact on our revenues due to continued losses on our CL&P standard offer contract and the mark to market on certain of our derivatives. Cost of Majority Owned Operations Our cost of majority owned operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $1.5 billion or 63% of revenues from majority owned operations. Cost of majority owned operations consist of $1.006 billion of cost of energy (primarily fuel and purchased energy costs), or 43% of revenues from majority owned operations and $483 million of operating expenses, or 21% of revenues from majority owned operations. Operating expenses consist of $207 million of labor related costs, $235 million of operating and maintenance costs, $38 million of non income based taxes and $3 million of asset retirement obligation accretion. Cost of Energy Fuel related costs include $476 million in coal costs, $233 million in natural gas costs, $105 million in fuel oil costs, $39 million in transmission and transportation expenses, $100 million of purchased energy costs, $35 million in other costs and $18 million in non cash SO2 emission credit amortization resulting from Fresh Start accounting. The Northeast region consumed 50%, 64% and 91% of total coal, natural gas and oil expenditures, respectively. The South Central region, which is comprised mainly of our Louisiana base loaded coal plant, consumed 32% of our total coal expenditures. Operating Expenses Reorganized NRG Operating expenses related to continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $483 million or 21% of revenues from majority owned operations. Operating expenses include labor, normal and major maintenance costs, environmental and safety costs, utilities costs, and non income based taxes. Labor costs include regular, overtime and contract costs at our plants and totaled $207 million. The Northeast region, where the majority of our assets reside, represents 53% of total labor costs; Australia represents 18%, while our South Central region represents 12%. Of the total O&M costs, normal and major maintenance at our plants accounted for $176 million, or 36% of total operating costs. Maintenance costs were largely driven by planned outages across our fleet, and the low sulfur coal conversion in western New York. The Northeast region represented over half of the normal and major maintenance, with a total of $99 million in costs in 2004 while Australia had $40 million in normal and major maintenance, or 23%. Operating expenses were positively impacted by a $7 million favorable settlement with a vendor regarding auxiliary power charges. Non income based taxes totaled $38 million net of $35 million in property tax credits, primarily associated with an enterprise zone program. Cost of majority owned operations was $95 million, or 69% of revenues from majority owned operations for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Cost of energy for this period was $63 million or 46% of revenues from majority owned operations and operating expenses were $32 million, or 23% of revenues from majority owned operations. Labor during this period totaled $11 million. Normal and major maintenance 96 Table of Contents was $12 million with 67% of the total normal and major maintenance for this time period coming from our Northeast region. Predecessor Company Cost of majority owned operations was $1.4 billion, or 75% of revenues from majority owned operations for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. Cost of majority owned operations was unfavorably impacted by increased generation in the Northeast region, partially offset by a reduction in trading and hedging activity resulting from a reduction in our power marketing activities. Our international operations were impacted by an unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates and continued mark to market of the Osborne contract at Flinders resulting from lower pool prices. Depreciation and Amortization Reorganized NRG Our depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $208 million. Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of the allocation of our historical depreciable fixed asset costs over the remaining lives of such property. Upon adoption of Fresh Start, we were required to revalue our fixed assets to fair value and determine new remaining lives for such assets. Our fixed assets were written down substantially upon our emergence from bankruptcy. We also determined new remaining depreciable lives, which are, on average, shorter than what we had previously used primarily due to the age and condition of our fixed assets. Depreciation and amortization expense for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 was $12 million. Depreciation and amortization expense consists of the allocation of our newly valued basis in our fixed assets over newly determined remaining fixed asset lives. Predecessor Company Our depreciation and amortization expense related to continuing operations for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 was $211 million. During this period, depreciation expense was unfavorably impacted by the shortening of the depreciable lives of certain of our domestic power generation facilities located in the Northeast region and the impact of recently completed construction projects. The depreciable lives of certain of our Northeast facilities, primarily our Connecticut facilities, were shortened to reflect economic developments in that region. Certain capitalized development costs were written off in connection with the Loy Yang project resulting in increased expense. Amortization expense increased due to reducing the life of certain software costs. General, Administrative and Development Reorganized NRG Our general, administrative and development costs related to continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $210 million. Of this total, $111 million or 5% of revenues from majority owned operations represents our corporate costs, with the remaining $99 million representing costs at our plant operations. Corporate costs are primarily comprised of corporate labor, external professional support, such as legal, accounting and audit fees, and office expenses. Corporate general, administrative and development expenses were negatively impacted this year by increased legal fees, increased audit costs and increased consulting costs due to our Sarbanes Oxley testing and implementation. Plant general, administrative and development costs primarily include insurance and external consulting costs. Plant insurance costs were $41 million. Additionally, we recorded $12 million in bad debt expense related to notes receivable. General, administrative and development costs were $13 million, or 10% of revenues from continuing operations for the period December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003. These costs are primarily comprised of corporate labor, insurance and external professional support, such as legal, accounting and audit fees. 97 Table of Contents Predecessor Company Our general, administrative and development costs related to continuing operations for the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003 were $170 million or 10% of revenues from majority owned operations. These costs are primarily comprised of corporate labor, insurance and external professional support, such as legal, accounting and audit fees. Other Charges (Credits) Reorganized NRG For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded other charges of $48 million, which consisted of $16 million of corporate relocation charges, $13 million of reorganization credits and $45 million of restructuring and impairment charges. For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 we recorded $2 million of reorganization charges. Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, we recorded other credits of $3.3 billion, which consisted primarily of $229 million related to asset impairments, $463 million related to legal settlements, $198 million related to reorganization charges and $8 million related to restructuring charges. We also incurred a $4.2 billion credit related to Fresh Start adjustments. Other charges (credits) consist of the following: Reorganized NRG Predecessor Company For the Period For the Period Year Ended December 6 January 1 December 31, December 31, December 5, 2004 2003 2003 (In millions) Corporate relocation charges $ 16 $ $ Reorganization items (13 ) 2 198 Impairment charges 45 229 Restructuring charges 8 Fresh Start adjustments (4,220 ) Legal settlement 463 Total $ 48 $ 2 $ (3,322 ) Corporate Relocation Charges On March 16, 2004, we announced plans to implement a new regional business strategy and structure. The new structure called for a reorganized leadership team and a corporate headquarters relocation to Princeton, New Jersey. The corporate headquarters staff were streamlined as part of the relocation, as functions were either reduced or shifted to the regions. As of December 31, 2005, the transition of the corporate headquarters is complete. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded $16 million for charges related to our corporate relocation activities, primarily for employee severance and termination benefits and employee related transition costs. These charges are classified separately in our statement of operations, in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. See Item 15 Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for more information. Costs not classified separately as relocation charges include rent expense of our temporary office in Princeton, construction costs of our new office and certain labor costs. All costs relating to the corporate relocation that are not classified separately as relocation charges, except for approximately $6 million of 98 Table of Contents related capital expenditures will be expensed as incurred and included in general, administrative and development expenses. Cash expenditures for 2004, including capital expenditures, were $22 million. We recognized a curtailment gain of approximately $1 million on our defined benefit pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2004, as a substantial number of our current headquarters staff left the Company in this period. Reorganization Items For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded a net credit of $13 million related primarily to the settlement of obligations recorded under Fresh Start. We incurred $7 million of professional fees associated with the bankruptcy which offset $20 million of credits associated with creditor settlements. For the periods December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003 and January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, we incurred $2 million and $198 million, respectively, in reorganization costs. All reorganization costs have been incurred since we filed for bankruptcy in May 2003. Also see Item 15 Note 8 for a tabular description of expenses. Impairment Charges We review the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with the guidelines of SFAS No. 144. As a result of this review, we recorded impairment charges of $45 million and $229 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, respectively, as shown in the table below. Of the $45 million total in 2004, Kendall and the Meriden turbine accounted for $27 million and $15 million, respectively. We successfully completed the sale of Kendall in November 2004 and expect to complete the sale of the Meriden turbines in 2006. There were no impairment charges for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. To determine whether an asset was impaired, we compared asset carrying values to total future estimated undiscounted cash flows. If an asset was determined to be impaired based on the cash flow testing performed, an impairment loss was recorded to write down the asset to its fair value. See Item 15 Note 8 for a list of impairment charges (credits) for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003. Restructuring Charges We incurred $8 million of employee separation costs and advisor fees during the period January 1, 2003 until we filed for bankruptcy in May 2003. Subsequent to that date we recorded all advisor fees as reorganization costs. 99 Table of Contents Fresh Start Adjustments During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a net credit of $3.9 billion (comprised of a $4.2 billion gain from continuing operations and a $0.3 billion loss from discontinued operations) in connection with fresh start adjustments. Following is a summary of the significant effects of the reorganization and Fresh Start: (In millions) Discharge of corporate level debt $ 5,162 Discharge of other liabilities 811 Establishment of creditor pool (1,040 ) Receivable from Xcel 640 Revaluation of fixed assets (1,392 ) Revaluation of equity investments (207 ) Valuation of SO 2 emission credits 374 Valuation of out of market contracts, net (400 ) Fair market valuation of debt 108 Valuation of pension liabilities (61 ) Other valuation adjustments (100 ) Total Fresh Start adjustments 3,895 Less discontinued operations (325 ) Total Fresh Start adjustments continuing operations $ 4,220 Legal Settlement Charges During the period January 1, 2003 to December 5, 2003, we recorded $463 million of legal settlement charges which consisted of the following. We recorded $396 million in connection with the resolution of an arbitration claim asserted by FirstEnergy Corp. As a result of this resolution, FirstEnergy retained ownership of the Lake Plant Assets and received an allowed general unsecured claim of $396 million under NRG Energys Plan of Reorganization. In November 2003, we settled litigation with Fortistar Capital in which Fortistar Capital released us from all litigation claims in exchange for a $60 million pre petition bankruptcy claim and an $8 million post petition bankruptcy claim. We had previously recorded approximately $11 million in connection with various legal disputes with Fortistar Capital; accordingly, we recorded an additional $57 million during November 2003. In November 2003, we settled our dispute with Dick Corporation in connection with Meriden Gas Turbines LLC through the payment of a general unsecured claim and a post petition pre confirmation payment. This settlement resulted in our recording an additional liability of $8 million in November 2003. In August 1995, we entered into a Marketing, Development and Joint Proposing Agreement, or the Marketing Agreement, with Cambrian Energy Development LLC, or Cambrian. Various claims arose in connection with the Marketing Agreement. In November 2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with Cambrian where we agreed to transfer our 100% interest in three gasco projects (NEO Ft. Smith, NEO Phoenix and NEO Woodville) and our 50% interest in two genco projects (MM Phoenix and MM Woodville) to Cambrian. In addition, we paid approximately $2 million in settlement of royalties incurred in connection with the Marketing Agreement. We had previously recorded a liability for royalties owed to Cambrian, therefore, we recorded an additional $1 million during November 2003. Other Income (Expense) Reorganized NRG During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded other expense of $167 million. Other expense consisted primarily of $266 million of interest expense, $72 million of refinancing related expenses, $16 million of write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments, offset by $160 million of equity in 100 Table of Contents earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (including $69 million from our investment in West Coast Power LLC) and $27 million of other income, net. Other income (expense) for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003, was an expense of $5 million and consisted primarily of $19 million of interest expense, partially offset by $14 million of equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we recorded other expense of $265 million. Other expense consisted primarily of $308 million of interest expense and $147 million of write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments, partially offset by equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $171 million and $19 million of other income, net. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Reorganized NRG For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded $160 million of equity earnings from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Our equity in earnings of WCP comprised $69 million of this amount with our equity in earnings of Enfield, MIBRAG, and Gladstone comprising $28 million, $21 million, and $17 million, respectively. Our investment in WCP generated favorable results due to the pricing under the CDWR contract. Additionally, revenues from ancillary services revenue and minimum load cost compensation power positively contributed to WCPs operating results. However, our equity earnings in the project as reported in our results of operations have been reduced by a net $116 million to reflect a non cash basis adjustment for in the money contracts resulting from adoption of Fresh Start. NRG Energys equity earnings were also favorably impacted by $23 million of unrealized gain related to our Enfield investment. This gain is associated with changes in the fair value of energy related derivative instruments not accounted for as hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $14 million for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 consists primarily of equity earnings from our 50% ownership in WCP of $9 million. Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we recorded $171 million of equity earnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Our 50% investment in WCP comprised $99 million of this amount with our investments in the MIBRAG, Loy Yang, Gladstone and Rocky Road projects comprising $22 million, $18 million, $12 million and $7 million, respectively, with the remaining amounts attributable to various domestic and international equity investments. 101 Table of Contents Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates consists of the following: Predecessor Reorganized NRG Company Year Ended December 6, 2003 January 1, 2003 December 31, Through Through 2004 December 31, 2003 December 5, 2003 (In millions) WCP $ 69 $ 9 $ 99 MIBRAG 21 22 Enfield 28 1 6 Gladstone 17 1 12 Rocky Road 7 7 James River 8 1 (2 ) NRG Saguaro 5 1 4 Scudder LA Trust 2 3 NRG National 1 2 Loy Yang 18 Other 2 1 Total Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates $ 160 $ 14 $ 171 Write Downs and Losses on Sales of Equity Method Investments As part of our periodic review of our equity method investments for impairments, we have taken write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments during the year ended December 31, 2004 of $16 million and $147 million for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. Our Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership (CALP) and James River investments were written down based on indicative market bids. The sale of CALP closed in the fourth quarter of 2004, while the sale agreement for James River has been terminated. There were no write downs and losses on sales of equity method investments for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Further details as to write downs and losses (gains) on sales of equity method investments recorded in the consolidated statement of operations are detailed in Item 15 Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Income, net Reorganized NRG During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded $27 million of other income, net, consisting primarily of interest income earned on notes receivable and cash balances. For the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 we recorded an immaterial amount of other income. Predecessor Company During the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, we recorded $19 million of other income, net. During this period other income, net consisted primarily of interest income earned on notes receivable and cash balances, offset in part by the unfavorable mark to market on our corporate level 160 million note that was cancelled in connection with our bankruptcy proceedings. 102 Table of Contents Interest Expense Reorganized NRG Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $266 million, consisting of interest expense on both our project and corporate level interest bearing debt. Significant amounts of our corporate level debt were forgiven upon our emergence from bankruptcy and we refinanced significant amounts of our project level debt with corporate level high yield notes and term loans in December 2003. Also included in interest expense is the amortization of debt financing costs of $9 million related to our corporate level debt and $13 million of amortization expense related primarily to debt discounts and premiums recorded as part of Fresh Start. Interest expense also includes the impact of any interest rate swaps that we have entered in order to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Interest expense for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 of $19 million consists primarily of interest expense at the corporate level, primarily related to the Second Priority Notes, term loan facility and revolving line of credit used to refinance certain project level financings. In addition, interest expense includes the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred as a result of our refinancing efforts and the amortization of discounts and premiums recorded upon the marking of our debt to fair value upon our adoption of the Fresh Start provision of SOP 90 7. Predecessor Company Interest expense for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 of $308 million consisted of interest expense on both our project and corporate level interest bearing debt. In addition, interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs and any interest rate swap termination costs. Interest expense during this period was favorably impacted by our ceasing to record interest expense on debt where it was probable that such interest would not be paid, such as the NRG Energy corporate level debt (primarily bonds) and the NRG Finance Company debt (construction revolver) due to our entering into bankruptcy in May 2003. We did not however cease to record interest expense on the project level debt outstanding at our Northeast Generating and South Central Generating facilities even though these entities were also in bankruptcy as these claims were deemed to be most likely not impaired and not subject to compromise. We also recorded substantial amounts of fees and costs related to our acquiring a debtor in possession financing arrangement while we were in bankruptcy. In addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy we wrote off any remaining deferred finance costs related to our corporate and project level debt including our Northeast and South Central project level debt as it was probable that they would be refinanced upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Interest expense was unfavorably impacted by an adverse mark to market on certain interest rate swaps that we have entered in order to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Due to our deteriorating financial condition during such period, hedge accounting treatment was ceased for certain of our interest rate swaps, causing changes in fair value to be recorded as interest expense. Refinancing Expense Refinancing expense was $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This amount includes $15 million of prepayment penalties and a $15 million write off of deferred financing costs related to refinancing certain amounts of our term loans with additional corporate level high yield notes in January 2004 and $14 million of prepayment penalties and a $27 million write off of deferred financing costs related to refinancing the senior credit facility in December 2004. Income Tax Expense Reorganized NRG Our income tax provision from continuing operations was $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and an income tax benefit of ($1) million for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003. The overall effective tax rate in 2004 and the short period in 2003 was 28.7% and (6.2%), respectively. The 103 Table of Contents change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a state tax refund received from Xcel Energy in 2003 and foreign income taxed in jurisdictions with tax rates different from the U.S. statutory rate. Our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2004 were offset by a full valuation allowance in accordance with SFAS No. 109. Under SOP 90 7, any future benefits from reducing a valuation allowance from pre confirmation deferred tax assets are required to be reported first as an adjustment of identifiable intangible assets and then as a direct addition to paid in capital versus a benefit on our statement of operations. The effective tax rate may vary from year to year depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses. These same and other factors, including history of pre tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets. Predecessor Company Income tax expense for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 was $38 million. The overall effective tax rate for the period ended December 5, 2003 was 1.3%. The rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a release in valuation allowance for net operating loss carryforwards that were utilized following our emergence from bankruptcy to offset the current tax on cancellation of debt income. Income taxes have been recorded on the basis that our U.S. subsidiaries and we would file separate federal income tax returns for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. Since our U.S. subsidiaries and we were not included in the Xcel Energy consolidated tax group, each of our U.S. subsidiaries that is classified as a corporation for U.S. income tax purposes filed a separate federal income tax return. It is uncertain if, on a stand alone basis, we would be able to fully realize deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other temporary differences, therefore a full valuation allowance has been established. Income From Discontinued Operations, net of Income Taxes Reorganized NRG We classified as discontinued operations the operations and gains/losses recognized on the sale of projects that were sold or were deemed to have met the required criteria for such classification pending final disposition. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, of approximately $25 million. During the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the period December 6, 2003 to December 31, 2003, discontinued operations consisted of the results of our NRG McClain LLC, Penobscot Energy Recovery Company, or PERC, Compania Boliviana De Energia Electrica S.A. Bolivian Power Company Limited, or Cobee, Hsin Yu, LSP Energy (Batesville), four NEO Corporation projects (NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO Prima Deshecha LLC and NEO Tajiguas LLC), Northbrook New York LLC, Northbrook Energy LLC and Audrain Generating LLC. All other discontinued operations were disposed of in prior periods. The $25 million income from discontinued operations includes a gain of $22 million, net of income taxes of $8 million, related primarily to the dispositions of Batesville, Cobee and Hsin Yu. Discontinued operations for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 is comprised of a loss of less than a million dollars attributable to the on going operations of our McClain, PERC, Cobee, LSP Energy, Hsin Yu, four NEO Corporation projects (NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO Prima Deshecha LLC and NEO Tajiguas LLC) and Audrain Generating LLC. The financial results of Northbrook New York LLC and Northbrook Energy LLC have not been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of cash flows, for the period December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 due to immateriality. Predecessor Company As of December 5, 2003, we classified as discontinued operations the operations and gains/losses recognized on the sales of projects that were sold or were deemed to have met the required criteria for such 104 Table of Contents classification pending final disposition. For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, discontinued operations consist of the historical operations and net gains/losses related to our Killingholme, McClain, PERC, Cobee, NEO Landfill Gas, Inc., or NLGI, seven NEO Corporation projects (NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO Prima Deshecha LLC, NEO Tajiguas LLC, NEO Ft. Smith LLC, NEO Woodville LLC and NEO Phoenix LLC), Timber Energy Resources, Inc., or TERI, Cahua, Energia Pacasmayo, LSP Energy, Hsin Yu projects and Audrain Generating LLC. Prior to December 6, 2003, Northbrook New York LLC and Northbrook NewYork LLC were unconsolidated affiliates because the ownership structure prevented us from exercising a controlling influence over operating and financial policies of the projects. For the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003, the results of operations related to such discontinued operations was a net loss of $316 million due to a net loss of results of operations from discontinued operations of Audrain Generating LLC of $133 million, loss on the sale of our Peru projects, impairment charges of $101 million and $24 million, respectively, recorded at McClain and NLGI and fresh start adjustments at LSP Energy. Reorganization and Emergence from Bankruptcy On May 14, 2003, we and 25 of our U.S. affiliates, filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or the Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, or the bankruptcy court. On May 15, 2003, NRG Energy, PMI, NRG Finance Company I LLC, NRGenerating Holdings (No. 23) B.V. and NRG Capital LLC filed the NRG plan of reorganization. On November 24, 2003, the bankruptcy court issued an order confirming the NRG plan of reorganization, and the plan became effective on December 5, 2003. On September 17, 2003, we filed the Northeast/ South Central plan of reorganization in connection with our Northeast and South Central subsidiaries in Chapter 11. On November 25, 2003, the bankruptcy court issued an order confirming the Northeast/ South Central plan of reorganization and the plan became effective on December 23, 2003. Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code and Fresh Start Between May 14, 2003 and December 5, 2003, we operated as a debtor in possession under the supervision of the bankruptcy court. Our financial statements for reporting periods within that timeframe were prepared in accordance with the provisions of SOP 90 7. For financial reporting purposes, the close of business on December 5, 2003, represents the date of emergence from bankruptcy. As used herein, the following terms refer to the Company and its operations: Predecessor Company The Company, pre emergence from bankruptcy The Companys operations prior to December 6, 2003 Reorganized NRG The Company, post emergence from bankruptcy The Companys operations from December 6, 2003 December 31, 2004 The implementation of the NRG plan of reorganization resulted in, among other things, a new capital structure, the satisfaction or disposition of various types of claims against the Predecessor Company, the assumption or rejection of certain contracts, and the establishment of a new board of directors. In connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted Fresh Start in accordance with the requirements of SOP 90 7. The application of SOP 90 7 resulted in the creation of a new reporting entity. Under Fresh Start, the enterprise value of our company was allocated among our assets and liabilities on a basis substantially consistent with purchase accounting in accordance with SFAS 141. Accordingly, we pushed down the effects of this allocation to all of our subsidiaries. Under the requirements of Fresh Start, we have adjusted our assets and liabilities, other than deferred income taxes, to their estimated fair values as of December 5, 2003. As a result of marking our assets and 105 Table of Contents liabilities to their estimated fair values, we determined that there was no excess reorganization value that was reallocated back to our tangible and intangible assets. Deferred taxes were determined in accordance with SFAS 109. The net effect of all Fresh Start adjustments resulted in a gain of $3.9 billion (comprised of a $4.2 billion gain from continuing operations and a $0.3 billion loss from discontinued operations), which is reflected in the Predecessor Companys results of operations for the period January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003. The application of the Fresh Start provisions of SOP 90 7 created a new reporting entity having no retained earnings or accumulated deficit. As part of the bankruptcy process we engaged an independent financial advisor to assist in the determination of our reorganized enterprise value. The fair value calculation was based on managements forecast of expected cash flows from our core assets. Managements forecast incorporated forward commodity market prices obtained from a third party consulting firm. A discounted cash flow calculation was used to develop the enterprise value of Reorganized NRG, determined in part by calculating the weighted average cost of capital of the Reorganized NRG. The Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, valuation methodology equates the value of an asset or business to the present value of expected future economic benefits to be generated by that asset or business. The DCF methodology is a forward looking approach that discounts expected future economic benefits by a theoretical or observed discount rate. The independent financial advisors prepared a 30 year cash flow forecast using a discount rate of approximately 11%. The resulting reorganization enterprise value as included in the Disclosure Statement ranged from $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion. The independent financial advisor then subtracted our project level debt and made several other adjustments to reflect the values of assets held for sale, excess cash and collateral requirements to estimate a range of Reorganized NRG equity value of between $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion. In constructing our Fresh Start balance sheet upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we used a reorganization equity value of approximately $2.4 billion, as we believe this value to be the best indication of the value of the ownership distributed to the new equity owners. Our NRG plan of reorganization provided for the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of NRG common stock to the various creditors resulting in a calculated price per share of $24.04. Our reorganization value of approximately $9.1 billion was determined by adding our reorganized equity value of $2.4 billion, $3.7 billion of interest bearing debt and our other liabilities of $3.0 billion. The reorganization value represents the fair value of an entity before liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after restructuring. This value is consistent with the voting creditors and bankruptcy courts approval of the NRG plan of reorganization. We recorded approximately $3.9 billion of net reorganization income (comprised of a $4.2 billion gain from continuing operations and a $0.3 billion loss from discontinued operations) in the Predecessor Companys statement of operations for 2003, which includes the gain on the restructuring of equity and the discharge of obligations subject to compromise for less than recorded amounts, as well as adjustments to the historical carrying values of our assets and liabilities to fair market value. Due to the adoption of Fresh Start as of December 5, 2003, the Reorganized NRG post Fresh Start statement of operations and statement of cash flows have not been prepared on a consistent basis with the Predecessor Companys financial statements and are therefore not comparable in certain respects to the 106 Table of Contents financial statements prior to the application of Fresh Start. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared to distinguish between Reorganized NRG and the Predecessor Company. Company Debt Discharge NRG December 5, and Exchange Fresh Start December 6, 2003 of Stock Adjustments Consolidation 2003 (In millions) Current Assets $ 1,718 $ 614 $ 4 $ 6 $ 2,342 Non current Assets 8,172 (155 ) (1,233 ) 41 6,825 Total Assets $ 9,890 $ 459 $ (1,229 ) $ 47 $ 9,167 Current Liabilities 2,190 999 1,187 1 4,377 Non current Liabilities 9,458 (6,270 ) (848 ) 46 2,386 Total Liabilities 11,648 (5,271 ) 339 47 6,763 Stockholders Equity (1,758 ) 2,404 1,758 2,404 Total Liabilities and Stockholders Equity $ 9,890 $ (2,867 ) $ 2,097 $ 47 $ 9,167 APB No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, requires us to effectively push down the effects of Fresh Start reporting to our unconsolidated equity method investments and to recognize an adjustment to our share of the earnings or losses of an investee as if the investee were a consolidated subsidiary. As a result of pushing down the impact of Fresh Start to our West Coast Power affiliate, we determined that a contract based intangible asset with a one year remaining life, consisting of the value of West Coast Powers California Department of Water Resources energy sales contract, must be established and recognized as a basis adjustment to our share of the future earnings generated by West Coast Power. This adjustment reduced our equity earnings in the approximate amount of $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This contract expired in December 2004. Known trends that will affect our results in the future: Acquisition of Texas Genco and Financing Transactions On February 2, 2006, NRG acquired Texas Genco LLC by purchasing all of the outstanding equity interests in Texas Genco pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, dated September 30, 2005, by and among NRG, Texas Genco, and the Sellers. Also see our detailed discussion in our Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Texas Genco is now a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG, and will be managed and accounted for as a new business segment to be referred to as NRG Texas. In order to facilitate the acquisition of Texas Genco, we entered into a series of financing transactions. Also see our detailed discussion in our Liquidity and Capital Resources section: Debt instruments: $3.575 billion Term Loan Facility $1.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility $1.0 billion Letter of Credit Facility $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes $2.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of 7.375% Senior Notes Equity instruments: $485 million from the issuance of 2 million shares of 5.75% Preferred Stock, net of issuance costs $985 million from the issuance of 20,855,057 shares of our common stock, net of issuance costs 107 Table of Contents These transactions also facilitated the refinancing of our outstanding debt as well as the debt outstanding for Texas Genco upon acquisition. Based on our current projections, our NRG Texas segment will be a profitable segment and will significantly increase our revenue and operating costs going forward. Partially offsetting this additional profit will be the increased interest expense due to the increased debt level as shown above. We have also increased the number of our outstanding shares by issuing approximately 35 million shares from both treasury and newly issued stock to the Sellers, as well as approximately 21 million newly issued shares to the public. This significant increase in outstanding shares will dilute our future earnings per share. At this time, we anticipate that the net effect in 2006 will be positive to our future results of operations as well as to our earnings per share. Acquisition of Remaining 50% Equity Interest in WCP On December 27, 2005, we entered into purchase and sale agreements for projects co owned with Dynegy. Under the agreements, we will acquire Dynegys 50% ownership interest in WCP (Generation) Holdings, Inc., and become the sole owner of WCPs 1,808 MW of generation in Southern California. We anticipate that the transaction will close during the first quarter of 2006. As of the date of acquisition we will consolidate the results of operations of WCP. When consolidated, the results of WCP will increase our revenues and cost of operations, but it will reduce our equity earnings. We anticipate that the net effect in 2006 will be positive to our results of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Significant Events during 2005 The repurchase of $645 million in aggregate principal amount of our Second Priority Notes, resulting in $54 million of refinancing charges The issuance of $250 million of 3.625% Preferred Stock The execution of the Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement whereby we repurchased $250 million of common stock Repatriation of $298 million of foreign funds utilizing the tax benefits of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 Cash collateral payments of $405 million supporting our hedging activities Collection of $71 million in an arbitration award related to TermoRio Execution of the Texas Genco Acquisition Agreement and related financing commitments Sale of non core assets resulting in $106 million in proceeds The announced signing of sales and purchase agreements for the sale of Audrain resulting in its reclassification as a discontinued operation 108 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the debt transactions during 2005 and subsequent transactions in 2006: Balance 2005 activity and 2006 activity and Outstanding at Outstanding at Outstanding at Date of Original December 31, December 31, February 25, Transaction Amount 2004 2005 2006 (In millions) Xcel Promissory Note Dec. 6, 2003 $ 10 $ 10 $ 10 $ 10 NRG 8% Second Priority Notes Dec. 23, 2003 Jan. 28, 2004 1,725 1,725 Repurchase of Notes Jan Mar, 2005 (41 ) Early redemption Feb Sep, 2005 (604 ) Ending balance Dec. 31, 2005 1,080 Repurchase of Notes Feb. 2, 2006 (1,080 ) Ending balance Feb. 25, 2006 $ NRG Credit Facility Term loan Dec. 23, 2003 950 450 Repayments of Term Loans Throughout 2005 (4 ) Ending balance Dec. 31, 2005 446 Prepayment of Term Loan Jan 2006 (446 ) Ending balance Feb. 25, 2006 $ Letter of Credit facility Dec. 23, 2003 250 350 350 Terminating Letter of Credit facility Feb. 2, 2006 (350 ) Ending balance Feb. 25, 2006 $ Corporate Revolver* Dec. 23, 2003 250 150 150 Terminating Corporate Revolver* Feb. 2, 2006 (150 ) Ending balance Feb. 25, 2006* $ New Sr. Secured Term loan Feb. 2, 2006 3,575 New Funded LC Facility Feb. 2, 2006 1,000 New Corporate Revolver* Feb. 2, 2006 1,000 Ending balance Feb. 25, 2006 $ 5,575 7.25% Senior Notes due 2014 Feb. 2, 2006 1,200 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 Feb. 2, 2006 2,400 Ending balance Feb. 25, 2006 $ 3,600 Total Corporate Level Debt* $ 2,535 $ 1,886 $ 7,185 * Amount indicates capacity to borrow under NRGs revolver facilities only. Un borrowed capacity is not included in total corporate level debt. Sources of Funds The principal sources of liquidity for our future operations and capital expenditures are expected to be existing cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and funds raised from new financing arrangements. Cash Flows from Operations. Our operating cash flows are expected to be impacted by, among other things: (i) spark spreads generally; (ii) commodity prices (including demand for natural gas, coal, oil and electricity); (iii) the cost of ordinary course operations and maintenance expenses; (iv) planned and unplanned outages; (v) restrictions in the declaration or payments of dividends or similar distributions from our subsidiaries; and (vi) the timing and nature of asset sales. Following are additional sources of cash flows: Letter of credit and revolver borrowing capacity. We had approximately $38 million of undrawn letter of credit capacity and $150 million of revolving credit capacity under our Amended Credit Facility as of December 31, 2005. On February 2, 2006 we terminated our Amended Credit Agreement and entered into a new Senior Credit Facility. The new Senior Credit Facility consists of a $3.575 billion term loan, $1.0 billion in a synthetic letter of credit facility and $1.0 billion in a revolver facility. Portions of the revolving credit facility are available as a swing line facility and as a revolving letter of credit sub facility. As of March 3, 2006, 109 Table of Contents we had approximately $225 million of undrawn letter of credit capacity under our senior credit facility and $845 million of revolving credit capacity under our Senior Credit Facility. The balance of the revolver has been used to issue non commercial letters of credit. See our discussion below on the Financing Transactions and Texas Genco Acquisition in this discussion and analysis. Issuance of $250 million in 3.625% Preferred Stock. On August 11, 2005, we issued 250,000 shares of 3.625% Preferred Stock to Credit Suisse First Boston Capital LLC, or CSFB, in a private placement. As of December 31, 2005, 250,000 shares of the 3.625% Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding at a liquidation value, net of issuance costs of $246 million. Holders of the 3.625% Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefore, cash dividends at the rate of 3.625% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 14, 2005. On or after August 11, 2015, we may redeem, subject to certain limitations, some or all of the 3.625% Preferred Stock with cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, plus accumulated but unpaid dividends, including liquidated damages, if any, to the redemption date. Proceeds from the sale of the 3.625% preferred securities along with cash on hand were used to redeem $229 million in Second Priority Notes, pay an early redemption penalty of $18 million and pay accrued interest of $4 million on the redeemed notes. Settlements and Asset Sales. On February 15, 2005 we received a $71 million settlement payment from Petrobras, our former partner in our TermoRio project in Brazil. During 2005, we received approximately $106 million in proceeds from the sale of our interest in non core projects, including our interest in Enfield, Northbrook New York and Northbrook Energy and remaining interest in Kendall. Repatriation of Foreign Funds. During the third quarter of 2005 we repatriated approximately $298 million of accumulated foreign earnings. Only a portion of this amount represents the cumulative earnings and profits from the foreign entities. Those earnings resulted in approximately $5 million of tax expense. This repatriation was initiated to utilize the tax benefits of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 which expired on December 31, 2005. Uses of Funds Our requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating our facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) Commercial Operations (formerly referred to as PMI) activities; (ii) capital expenditures; (iii) corporate financial restructuring and (iv) project finance requirements. (i) Commercial Operations Commercial Operations activities comprise the single largest requirement for liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counter parties; (ii) initial collateral required to establish trading relationships; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (i.e., buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); and (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions. As of December 31, 2005, Commercial Operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $438 million, and $227 million outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support our economic hedging activities. Future liquidity requirements may change based on our hedging activity, fuel purchases, future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on our credit ratings and general perception of creditworthiness. Following the Acquisition, our debt instruments permit us to grant secured priority liens on our assets to support certain trading activities which will provide an alternative to posting cash deposits and letters of credit. See our discussion below on the Financing Transactions and Texas Genco Acquisition in this discussion and analysis. 110 Table of Contents (ii) Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $106 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, and $119 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Capital expenditures in 2005 related to the continued PRB conversions, associated conveyor track and emissions compliance upgrades at our Western New York plants. Indian Rivers PRB conversion is underway at units 1 3. Unit 4 at Indian River, originally targeted for conversion, was deemed incompatible for PRB coal during 2005. Capital expenditures in 2004 also related primarily to the conversion of our western New York plants to PRB coal, as well as the Playford 2 refurbishment at our Flinders operation in Australia and planned outages across our fleet. (iii) Corporate Financial Restructuring Repurchase and redemption of Second Priority Notes during 2005. In conjunction with our goal of improving our credit ratings we manage our capital allocation around a target of 45% 60% debt to capital ratio. As such, we may elect periodically to modify our corporate financial structure. Throughout 2005, we repurchased or redeemed, and subsequently retired, $645 million of our Second Priority Notes. Total costs associated with the repurchase and redemptions was $52 million in early redemption premium, $9 million in accrued but unpaid interest, and $7 million in accrued but unpaid liquidated damages. Redemption of Second Priority Notes and Termination of Credit Facility during 2006. On January 31, 2006 we repaid $446 million in outstanding principal plus $3 million in accrued interest and terminated our term loan under our Amended Credit Facility. On February 2, 2006, we repurchased and retired $1.08 billion of our Second Priority Notes, pursuant to a tender offer, paying approximately $138 million in consent premiums and accrued interest. On February 2, 2006 we defeased the remaining un tendered $0.4 million of our Second Priority Notes, effectively terminating our obligations with respect to such Notes. Also on February 2, 2006 we paid $1 million in accrued fees and terminated our revolving facility and our funded letter of credit facility under our Amended Credit Facility, and simultaneously issued new indebtedness, as described below in New Financing Structure and Texas Genco Acquisition in this discussion and analysis. Accelerated Share Repurchase Plan. On August 11, 2005, we entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement with CSFB, pursuant to which we repurchased $250 million of our common stock on that date that equaled a total of 6,346,788 shares, which were held in treasury. We funded the repurchase with cash on hand. On March 3, 2006, we paid to CSFB a cash purchase price adjustment of approximately $7 million based upon the weighted average value of NRGs common stock over a period of approximately six months, subject to a minimum price of 97% and a maximum price of 103% of the closing price per share on August 10, 2005, or $39.39. Preferred Dividend Payments. During 2005, we paid approximately $17 million in four dividend payments to our holders of our 4% Preferred Stock. On December 15, 2005, we made an approximate $3 million dividend payment to our 3.625% preferred shareholders of record as of December 1, 2005. (iv) Project Finance Requirements We are a holding company and conduct our operations primarily through subsidiaries. Historically, we have utilized project level debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct our power plants and related assets. Consistent with our strategy, we may seek, where available on commercially reasonable terms, project level debt in connection with the assets or businesses of our affiliates, or we may develop, construct or acquire new projects. Project level borrowings are substantially non recourse to other subsidiaries, affiliates and us, and are generally secured by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of the related project subsidiary or affiliate being financed. Some of these project financings may require us to post collateral in the form of cash or an acceptable letter of credit. 111 Table of Contents Principal on short term debt, long term debt and capital leases as of December 31, 2005 are due and payable in the following periods (in millions): Subsidiary/Description Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Xcel Energy Note $ 10 $ 10 $ $ $ $ $ Amended Credit Facility due Dec. 2011 796 796 8% Second Priority Notes 1,080 1,080 NRG Energy Center Minneapolis, due 2013 and 2017 111 8 9 10 11 11 62 NRG Peaker Finance Co LLC 297 7 11 13 15 20 231 Flinders Power Finance Pty 177 6 14 4 8 18 127 Camas Pwr BLR LP Bank facility 4 3 1 Camas Pwr BLR LP Bonds 3 1 2 Itiquira Energetica S.A., due January 2012 19 3 3 3 3 3 4 Itiquira Energetica S.A., due December 2013 30 4 4 4 4 4 10 Subtotal Debt, Bonds and Notes 2,527 1,918 44 34 41 56 434 Saale Energie GmbH, Schkopau (capital lease) 214 61 34 28 21 10 60 Conemaugh Fuels LLC (capital lease) Subtotal Capital Leases 214 61 34 28 21 10 60 Total Debt $ 2,741 $ 1,979 $ 78 $ 62 $ 62 $ 66 $ 494 These amounts reflect scheduled amortization of principal as of December 31, 2005, with the exception of the 8% Second Priority Notes, and our Credit Facility, for which 2006 amounts reflect early termination. The table below reflects the new short term and long term debt amounts and the expected future payments. Also see our discussion below on the Financing Transactions and Texas Genco Acquisition in this discussion and analysis, as well as Item 15 Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on events that may affect debt payment schedules. Description Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter New Credit Facility due Feb 2013 $ 3,575 $ 26 $ 36 $ 36 $ 36 $ 36 $ 3,405 7.25% Notes due 2014 1,200 1,200 7.375% Notes due 2016 2,400 2,400 Total Debt $ 7,175 $ 26 $ 36 $ 36 $ 36 $ 36 $ 7,005 112 Table of Contents Historical Cash Flows We have obtained cash from operations, proceeds from repayment of outstanding notes receivable, proceeds from the sale of certain assets and the proceeds from the sale of preferred stock. We have used these funds to finance operations, reduce our outstanding Second Priority Notes, repurchase common stock through an accelerated share repurchase plan, service debt obligations, finance capital expenditures, and meet other cash and liquidity needs. The following table reflects the changes in cash flows for the comparative years and we include a detailed discussion on the changes during the last year. All cash flow categories include the cash flows from continuing operations and discontinued operations: Predecessor Reorganized NRG Company For the Period For the Period Year Ended Year Ended December 6 January 1 December 31, December 31, December 31, December 5, 2005 2004 2003 2003 (In millions) Net cash provided (used) by operating activities $ 68 $ 645 $ (589 ) $ 238 Net cash (used) provided by investing activities 158 184 363 (186 ) Net cash provided (used) by financing activities (830 ) (284 ) 393 (30 ) Net Cash Provided (Used) By Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $580 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. This is primarily due to the following reasons: Net income decreased by $102 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Due to the sharp increase in the sale price per MWh, our derivative contract terms required collateral deposits of $405 million during 2005, compared to $7 million during 2004, a difference of $398 million. As of December 31, 2005 we had collateral deposits of $438 million and we expect $405 of this amount to be refunded during 2006 as the underlying contracts expire. A decrease of $60 million in distributions from our equity investments during 2005 compared to 2004. The majority of this decrease is from our WCP investment. Since the expiration of the CDWR contract on December 31, 2004, WCPs profit has been significantly reduced and has subsequently distributed $59 million less dividends during 2005 compared to 2004. Receipt of $100 million in 2004 related to the settlement with Xcel Energy. Net Cash Provided (Used) By Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash provided by investing activities was $26 million less than for the year ended December 31, 2004. This decrease is due to the following mix of investment activities: During 2004, we sold interests in non core assets for proceeds totaling $304 million. As most of the non core assets were sold during 2004 and management began focusing on different areas of operation, during 2005 proceeds from the sale of non core assets fell by $198 million. Our capital expenditures were $13 million less during 2005 compared to 2004 due to lower PRB conversion expenditures. During 2005, proceeds from payments on our notes receivable increased by $82 million, primarily due to the payment from TermoRio of approximately $71 million as the dispute related to this note was settled. 113 Table of Contents In comparison to an increase of $27 million during 2004, restricted cash balances decreased by $46 million, a difference of $72 million. This amount is explained by the release of approximately $38 million of restricted cash at our Flinders facility as a result of our refinancing of Flinders debt, as well as the release of accounts from restrictions during post bankruptcy operations. Net Cash Provided (Used) By Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used by financing activities increased by $546 million in comparison to 2004. The activity for 2005 consisted of: The redemption and repurchase of $645 million of our Second Priority Secured Notes. In order to redeem our Second Priority Notes, we issued $420 million of the 4% Preferred Stock in December 2004, and subsequently, $250 million of the 3.625% Preferred Stock in August of 2005. The timing difference between the receipt of cash from our 4% Preferred Stock in December 2004 and the redemption of debt in 2005 is the primary reason for the increase in cash used for financing activities in 2005 in comparison to 2004. Our accelerated share repurchase payment of $250 million. Payment of $46 million for financing costs to refinance our Flinders debt. Payment of $20 million of dividends to holders of our preferred stock. During 2004, the primary use of funds for financing activities was related to the repayment of project level debt at McClain of approximately $157 million and regular debt payments of approximately $135 million. Other Liquidity Matters NOLs and Deferred Tax Assets As of December 31, 2005, we U.S. NOL carryforwards of approximately $93 million. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit will not be realized on a substantial portion of the deferred tax assets relating to future tax benefits. This assessment includes consideration of positive and negative factors, including our current financial position, historical results of operations and current results of operations, projected future taxable income, including projected operating and capital gains, and available tax planning strategies. Therefore, as of December 31, 2005, a consolidated valuation allowance of $756 million was recorded against the net deferred tax assets, in accordance with SFAS No. 109. However, we have not provided a valuation allowance for approximately $15 million of net deferred tax assets which consist of mark to market adjustments per SFAS 133 and utilization of carryover net operating losses to the extent of taxable income generated for the year ended December 31, 2005. Conclusion on Future Liquidity As of December 31, 2005 our liquidity was $758 million and included $570 million of unrestricted and restricted cash. Our liquidity also included $150 million of available capacity under our revolving line of credit and $38 million of availability under our letter of credit facility. As of December 31, 2004 our liquidity was $1.6 billion and included $1.2 billion of unrestricted and restricted cash. Our liquidity also included $150 million of available capacity under our revolving line of credit and $193 million of availability under our letter of credit facility. Based on the new financing transactions, but assuming the cash balances as of December 31, 2005 and the outstanding instruments as of March 3, 2006, our liquidity would be $1.6 billion and includes $570 million of unrestricted and restricted cash. Our liquidity include $845 million of available capacity under our new Revolving Credit Facility and $225 million of availability under our new synthetic Letter of Credit Facility, as of March 3, 2006. Please see discussion below for further detail. Management believes that these amounts and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance capital expenditures, to fund dividends to our preferred shareholders and other liquidity commitments for the next 12 months. Management continues to regularly monitor the companys ability to finance the needs of its 114 Table of Contents operating, financing and investing activity in a manner consistent with its intention to maintain a debt to capital ratio within a range of 45% 60%. Known Trends and Other Factors Affecting our Liquidity New Financing Structure and Texas Genco Acquisition On February 2, 2006, NRG acquired Texas Genco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, by purchasing all of the outstanding equity interests in Texas Genco pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, dated September 30, 2005, by and among NRG, Texas Genco, and each of the direct and indirect owners of Texas Genco. The purchase price of approximately $6.1 billion consisted of $4.4 billion in cash and the issuance of approximately 35.4 million shares of NRGs common stock valued at $1.7 billion. This amount is subject to adjustment due to acquisition costs. The value of our common stock issued to the Sellers was based on our average stock price immediately before and after the closing date of February 2, 2006. The Acquisition includes the assumption of approximately $2.7 billion of Texas Genco debt. Texas Genco is now a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG, and will be managed and accounted for as a new business segment to be referred to as NRG Texas. The Texas Genco acquisition was partially funded at closing with the combination of (i) cash proceeds received upon the issuance and sale in a public offering of 20,855,057 shares of NRGs common stock at a price of $48.75 per share; (ii) cash proceeds received upon the issuance and sale of $3.6 billion of unsecured high yield notes; (iii) cash proceeds received upon the issuance and sale in a public offering of 2,000,000 shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock at a price of $250 per share; (iv) funds borrowed under a new senior secured credit facility consisting of a $3.575 billion term loan facility, a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $1.0 billion synthetic letter of credit facility; and (v) cash on hand. Texas Genco owns approximately 11,000 MW of net operating generation capacity, and sells power and related services in the Texas ERCOT market. New Senior Credit Facility On February 2, 2006, we also entered into a new senior secured first priority credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions, including Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc., as collateral agent, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as joint lead book runners, joint lead arrangers and co documentation agents providing for up to an aggregate amount of $5.575 billion, or the New Senior Credit Facility. The New Senior Credit Facility consists of a $3.575 billion term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility, a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, and a $1.0 billion synthetic letter of credit facility, or the Letter of Credit Facility. The New Senior Credit Facility replaced our then existing senior secured credit facility. The Term Loan Facility will mature on February 2, 2013 and will amortize in 27 consecutive equal quarterly installments of 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility with the balance payable on the seventh anniversary thereof. The full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility will mature on February 2, 2011. The Letter of Credit Facility will mature on February 2, 2013 and no amortization will be required in respect thereof. The New Senior Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries, with certain customary or agreed upon exceptions for unrestricted foreign subsidiaries, project subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries. In addition, the New Senior Credit Facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, with certain customary or agreed upon exceptions for unrestricted foreign subsidiaries, project subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries. The capital stock of substantially all of our subsidiaries, with certain exceptions for unrestricted subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries and project subsidiaries, has been pledged for the benefit of the New Senior Credit Facility lenders. The New Senior Credit Facility is also secured by a first priority perfected security interest in all of the property and assets owned at any time or acquired by us and our subsidiaries, other than certain limited 115 Table of Contents exceptions. These exceptions include assets such as the assets of certain unrestricted subsidiaries, equity interests in certain of our project affiliates that have non recourse debt financing, and voting equity interests in excess of 66% of the total outstanding voting equity interest of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The New Senior Credit Facility contains customary covenants, which, among other things require us to meet certain financial tests, including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, each at the corporate level and on a consolidated basis, and further limits our ability to, among other things: incur indebtedness and liens and enter into sale and lease back transactions; make investments, loans and advances; engage in mergers, acquisitions, consolidations and asset sales; pay dividends and make other restricted payments; enter into transactions with affiliates; make capital expenditures; make debt payments; and make certain changes to the terms of material indebtedness. Senior Notes On February 2, 2006, we completed the sale of (i) $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior notes due 2014, or 7.25% Senior Notes, and (ii) $2.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of 7.375% senior notes due 2016, or 7.375% Senior Notes, collectively the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated February 2, 2006, between us and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, as Trustee, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture, dated February 2, 2006, between us, the guarantors named therein and the Trustee, relating to the 7.25% Senior Notes, and as supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated February 2, 2006,(together with the Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture, the Indentures) between us, the guarantors named therein and the Trustee, relating to the 7.375% Senior Notes. The Indentures provide, among other things, that the Senior Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of NRG. Interest is payable on the Senior Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year beginning on August 1, 2006 until their maturity dates February 1, 2014 for the 7.25% Senior Notes and February 1, 2016 for the 7.375% Senior Notes. Prior to February 1, 2010 for the 7.25% Senior Notes and prior to February 1, 2011 for the 7.375% Senior Notes, we may redeem all or a portion of the series of Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make whole premium and accrued interest. On or after February 1, 2010 for the 7.25% Senior Notes and on or after February 1, 2011 for the 7.375% Senior Notes, we may redeem all or a portion of the series of Senior Notes at redemption prices set forth in the Indentures. In addition, at any time prior to February 1, 2009, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the series of Senior Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the Indentures. The terms of the Indentures, among other things, limit our ability and certain of our subsidiaries ability to: make restricted payments; restrict dividends or other payments of subsidiaries; incur additional debt; engage in transactions with affiliates; create liens on assets; 116 Table of Contents engage in sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets and the assets of its subsidiaries. The Indentures provide for customary events of default which include, among others, nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of other agreements in the Indentures; defaults in failure to pay certain other indebtedness; the rendering of judgments to pay certain amounts of money against us and our subsidiaries; the failure of certain guarantees to be enforceable; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding series of Senior Notes may declare all of the Senior Notes of such series to be due and payable immediately. Second Lien Structure Before the Acquisition, Texas Gencos capital structure permitted the grant of second priority liens on its assets as security for their obligations under certain long term power sales agreements and related hedges. The Credit Agreement for New Senior Credit Facility and the Indentures, which became effective as of February 2, 2006, allow these arrangements to remain in place. In addition, the new debt instruments also permit us to grant second priority liens on our other assets in the United States in order to secure obligations under power sales agreements and related hedges, within certain limits. The seven trading counterparties of Texas Genco who held second priority liens on Texas Gencos assets as of February 2, 2006, have been offered a second priority lien on NRGs other assets under the new structure, as additional collateral. Going forward, NRG anticipates that it will use the second lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it may otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under long term power sales and related hedges. Also see Item 1 Business section within the Power Marketing and Commercial Operations discussion for quantified utilization as of December 31, 2005. Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock On February 2, 2006, we completed the issuance of 2 million shares of 5.75% mandatory convertible preferred stock, or the 5.75% Preferred Stock, at an offering price of $250 per share for total net proceeds after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts of approximately $485 million. Dividends on the 5.75% Preferred Stock are $14.375 per share per year, and are due and payable on a quarterly basis beginning on March 15, 2006. The 5.75% Preferred Stock will automatically convert into common stock on March 16, 2009, or the Conversion Date, at a rate that is dependent upon the applicable market value of our common stock. If the applicable market value of our common stock is $60.45 a share or higher at the Conversion Date, then the 5.75% Preferred Stock is convertible at a rate of 4.1356 shares of our common stock for every share of 5.75% Preferred Stock outstanding. If the applicable market value of our common stock is less than or equal to $48.75 per share at the Conversion Date, then the 5.75% Preferred Stock is convertible at a rate of 5.1282 shares of our common stock for every share of 5.75% Preferred Stock outstanding. If the applicable market value of our common stock is between $48.75 per share and $60.45 per share at the Conversion Date, then the 5.75% Preferred Stock is convertible into common stock at a rate that is between 4.1356 per share and 5.1282 per share of common stock. Common Stock On January 31, 2006, we completed the issuance of 20,855,057 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $48.75 per share for total net proceeds after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts of approximately $985 million. Sale of Audrain Audrain has an approximate total of $355 million in long and short term debt. We anticipate that the sale of Audrain will close during the first half of 2006 upon which these balances will be eliminated. 117 Table of Contents Brownfield Developments As part of our strategy to reinvest capital in our existing assets for reason of repowering and expansion of current generation sites, management is evaluating opportunities within our core areas of operations. During the third quarter, we received a Title V Air Permit from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to add a fourth unit of generating capacity at our Big Cajun II Generating Station in New Roads, Louisiana. The total capital expenditure expected from the construction of the 675 MW expansion project is approximately $1 billion and would take four years to build. Our Big Cajun II facility serves the electricity needs of Louisianas 11 electric cooperatives and we believe that there is additional unmet demand for coal fired generation in the area. We are currently evaluating potential partners and customers for this project as they are critical to the consideration of when to proceed with this project. Operations in Australia NRG is currently considering strategic alternatives with respect to Australia either to reposition its assets more effectively within the National Electricity Market or to monetize its investment. We will seek to determine the best option to optimize our investment during 2006. Off Balance Sheet Items Obligations Under Certain Guarantee Contracts NRG and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include financial and performance guarantees, stand by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. See Note 29, Guarantees and Other Contingent Liabilities for further details of the guarantee arrangements. Retained or Contingent Interests NRG does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. Derivative Instrument obligations On August 11, 2005 NRG issued the 3.625% Preferred Stock which includes a conversion feature which is considered a derivative per FAS 133. Although it is considered a derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting as it is excluded from the scope pursuant to paragraph 11(a) of SFA 133. Despite this exclusion, per the guidance of EITF Topic D 98 the conversion feature must be marked to market. Currently, the conversion feature is valued at $0 as our stock price is outside the conversion range. See Note 18 Capital Structure for further discussion. Obligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity Variable interest in Equity investments As of December 31, 2005, we have not entered into any financing structure that is designed to be off balance sheet that would create liquidity, financing or incremental market risk or credit risk to us. However, we have numerous investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy related entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our pro rata share of non recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $178 million and $252 million as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to us. In the normal course of business we may be asked to loan funds to unconsolidated affiliates on both a long and short term basis. Such transactions are generally accounted for as accounts payable and receivable to/from affiliates and notes payable/receivable to/from affiliates and if appropriate, bear market based interest rates. 118 Table of Contents New Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility and Revolver Facility Under the New Senior Credit Facility we entered into on February 2, 2006, we have a $1.0 billion synthetic Letter of Credit Facility that is unfunded directly by NRG, and a $1.0 billion senior Revolving Credit Facility. The synthetic Letter of Credit Facility is secured by a $1.0 billion cash collateral deposit, held by Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch as the Issuing Bank. Under the synthetic Letter of Credit Facility, we are allowed to issue letters of credit to support our obligations under commodity hedging or power purchase arrangements. We are permitted to issue up to $300 million in unfunded letters of credit under our Revolving Credit Facility for ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions that are permitted under the New Senior Credit Facility, or revolver letters of credit. As of March 3, 2006, we had issued $775 million in funded letters of credit under the Letter of Credit Facility. Of this amount, a portion was issued to support obligations under terminated NRG and Texas Genco letter of credit facilities. As of March 3, 2006, we had issued $155 million in revolver letters of credit, a portion of which supports non commercial letter of credit obligations under the terminated NRG and Texas Genco letters of credit facilities. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments We have a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to our capital expenditure programs. The following is a summarized table of contractual obligations. See additional discussion in Item 15 Notes 17 and 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Payments Due by Period as of December 31, 2005 After Contractual Cash Obligations Total Short term 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Long term debt (including estimated interest) $ 3,600 $ 201 $ 391 $ 408 $ 2,600 Capital lease obligations (including estimated interest) 406 77 90 52 187 Operating leases 150 25 37 27 61 Coal purchase and transportation obligations 416 192 154 52 18 Total contractual cash obligations $ 4,572 $ 495 $ 672 $ 539 $ 2,866 Amount of Guarantee Liabilities Expiration per Period as of December 31, 2005 Total Amounts After Guarantee Type Committed Short term 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Funded standby letters of credit $ 312 $ 312 $ $ $ Unfunded standby letters of credit 9 9 Surety bonds 4 4 Asset sales guarantee obligations 123 13 110 Commodity sales guarantee obligations 91 62 12 14 3 Other guarantees 91 1 90 Total guarantees $ 630 $ 387 $ 26 $ 14 $ 203 We have a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to our capital expenditure programs, as discussed in Item 15 119 Table of Contents Note 25, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of commitments and contingencies that also include contractual obligations and commercial commitments that occurred during 2005. Derivative Instruments We may enter into long term power sales contracts, long term gas purchase contracts and other energy related commodities financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices, to hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities and protect fuel inventories. In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of our variable rate and fixed rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements. The tables below disclose the trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; identify changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2005 based on whether fair values are determined by quoted market prices or more subjective means; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2005.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of 120 Table of Contents themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable. In any case, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We identify our most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting Policy Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application Revenue Recognition and Derivative Activity Assumptions used in valuation models Market maturity and economic conditions Contract interpretation Market conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commitments Documentation requirements Market conditions in foreign countries Regulatory and political environments and requirements Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets Ability of tax authority decisions to withstand legal challenges or appeals Anticipated future decisions of tax authorities Application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions. Ability to utilize tax benefits through carrybacks to prior periods and carryforwards to future periods. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Recoverability of investment through future operations Regulatory and political environments and requirements Estimated useful lives of assets Environmental obligations and operational limitations Estimates of future cash flows Estimates of fair value (fresh start) Judgment about triggering events Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Estimated useful lives for finite lived intangible assets Judgment about impairment triggering events Estimates of reporting units fair value Fair value estimate of certain power sales and fuel contracts using forward pricing curves as of the closing date over the life of each contract Contingencies Estimated financial impact of event(s) Judgment about likelihood of event(s) occurring 121 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition and Derivative Instruments We record revenues using two methods of accounting: accrual accounting and mark to market accounting. We describe our use of accrual accounting, including the application of hedge accounting, in more detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2001, we adopted SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 137, SFAS 138 and SFAS 149. SFAS 133, as amended, requires us to mark to market all derivatives on the balance sheet. In some cases hedge accounting may apply. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are a) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure, b) whether or not the overall risk is being reduced and c) if there is correlation between the value of the derivative instrument and the underlying obligation. Formal documentation of the hedging relationship, the nature of the underlying risk, the risk management objective, and the means by which effectiveness will be assessed is created at the inception of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of non hedge derivatives are immediately recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged assets, liabilities and firm commitments or for forecasted transactions, deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, or OCI, until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings. Derivative instruments valuation assets and liabilities consist of a combination of energy and energy related derivative contracts. While some of these contracts represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources, other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices, contract quantities, or both. In determining the fair value of these derivative/financial instruments we use estimates, various assumptions, judgment of management and when considered appropriate third party experts in determining the fair value of these derivatives. However, future market prices and actual quantities will vary from those used in recording derivative instruments valuation assets and liabilities, and it is possible that such variations could be material. Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets At December 31, 2005, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $756 million primarily related to our U.S. net deferred tax assets. In assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the demonstration of a history of earnings and generation of future income during the periods in which those temporary differences will be deductible. As of December 31, 2005, we have approximately $93 million of U.S. federal and state net operating loss (NOLs) carryforwards for financial reporting purposes. The ultimate utilization of our NOLs will depend on several factors, such as our ability to utilize tax benefits through carrybacks to prior periods and carryforwards to future periods, the application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions, the ability of tax authority decisions to withstand legal challenges or appeals, and anticipated future decisions of tax authorities. We continue to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions. Considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. A tax liability has been recorded for certain tax filing positions where our inability to sustain the tax return position is probable and estimable. Such liabilities are based on managements judgment which considers the best estimate of the amount and probable outcome of the tax position, and it can take several years between the time when a liability is recorded and when the related filing position is resolved with the taxing authority. Management periodically reviews these matters and adjusts the liabilities recorded on the financial statements as appropriate. Evaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other Than Temporary Decline in Value In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we evaluate property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are: Significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset; 122 Table of Contents Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition; Adverse business climate; Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset, Current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; Change in our intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to us. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. We use our best estimates in making these evaluations and consider various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs, and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material. For assets to be held and used, if we determine that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, we must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value under SFAS No. 144, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held for sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. We consider quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence of such information, we may consider prices of similar assets, consult with brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. We also will discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability weights a range of possible outcomes. The use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in our estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material. We are also required to evaluate our equity method and cost method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired. Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, or APB18, provides the accounting requirements for these investments. The standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under APB 18 is whether the value that is considered an other than a temporary decline in value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under APB 18 involves the same uncertainties as described for long lived assets that we own directly and account for in accordance with SFAS 144. Similarly, the estimates that we make with respect to our equity and cost method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which we hold these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of SFAS 144, we would record our proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate our investment for an other than temporary decline in value under APB 18. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the periods December 6, 2003 through December 31, 2003 and January 1, 2003 through December 5, 2003 net income from continuing operations was reduced by $6 million, $45 million, $0 million and $229 million, respectively, due to investment impairments. 123 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets As part of the Acquisition we expect to record intangible assets that may include goodwill resulting from the Acquisition and other intangible assets. We will apply SFAS 141, and SFAS 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to account for these intangibles. Under these standards we will amortize all finite lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted average useful life, whereas goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives are not amortized. However, goodwill and all intangible assets will be tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates that an impairment may have occurred, or at a minimum on an annual basis. If necessary, our goodwill and or intangible asset will be impaired at that time. In connection with the Acquisition, we expect to recognize the fair value of certain power sales and fuel contracts acquired. We estimate that the fair value of these contracts using forward pricing curves as of the closing date over the life of each contract. These contracts had negative fair values at the closing date of the acquisition and will be reflected as assumed contracts in the combined balance sheet. Assumed contracts are amortized to revenues and fuel expense as applicable based on the estimated realization of the preliminary fair value established on the closing date over the contractual lives. Contingencies We record a loss contingency when management determines it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. We describe in detail our contingencies in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Developments See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as found in Item 15 for a discussion of recent accounting developments. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to several market risks in our normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with our merchant power generation or with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transaction. The types of market risks we are exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk and currency exchange risk. In order to manage these risks we utilize various fixed price forward purchase and sales contracts, futures and option contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps and options traded in the over the counter financial markets to: Manage and hedge our fixed price purchase and sales commitments; Manage and hedge our exposure to variable rate debt obligations, Reduce our exposure to the volatility of cash market prices; and Hedge our fuel requirements for our generating facilities. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices, volatilities in commodities, and correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal and oil. A number of factors influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products. These factors include: Seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand Extreme peak demands due to weather conditions 124 Table of Contents Available supply resources Transportation availability and reliability within and between regions Changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations As part of our overall portfolio, we manage the commodity price risk of our generation assets by entering into various derivative or non derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of electricity and purchases of fuel. These instruments include forward purchase and sale contracts, futures and option contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps and options traded in the over the counter financial markets. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon managements assessment of market, weather, operational, and other factors. While some of the contracts we use to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources, other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices, contract quantities, or both. We use our best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts we hold and sell. These estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations, time value, volatility factors, and credit exposure. However, it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording mark to market derivative instrument valuations, and such variations could be material. We measure the sensitivity of our portfolio to potential changes in market prices using value at risk. Value at risk is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price volatility. We calculate value at risk using a variance/covariance technique that models positions using a linear approximation of their value. Our value at risk calculation includes mark to market and non mark to market energy assets and liabilities. We utilize a diversified value at risk model to calculate the estimate of potential loss in the fair value of our energy assets and liabilities including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions. The key assumptions for our diversified model include (1) a lognormal distribution of price returns, (2) one day holding period, (3) a 95% confidence interval, (4) a rolling 24 month forward looking period and (5) market implied price volatilities and historical price correlations. This model encompasses the following generating regions: ENTERGY, NEPOOL, NYPP, PJM, WSCC and MAIN. The estimated maximum potential loss in fair value of our commodity portfolio, including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transaction, calculated using the diversified VAR model is as follows: (In millions) Year end December 31, 2005 $ 36.9 Average 27.6 High 45.9 Low 16.0 Year end December 31, 2004 26.7 Average 40.3 High 53.4 Low 26.7 In order to provide additional information for comparative purposes to our peers we also utilize value at risk to model the estimate of potential loss of financial derivative instruments included in derivative instruments valuation assets and liabilities. This estimation includes those energy contracts accounted for as a hedge under SFAS 133, as amended. The estimated maximum potential loss in fair value of the financial derivative instruments calculated using the diversified VAR model as of December 31, 2005 is approximately $37 million. 125 Table of Contents Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as value at risk, the relative immaturity of the competitive markets for electricity and related derivatives, and the seasonality of changes in market prices, the value at risk calculation may not capture the full extent of commodity price exposure. Additionally, actual changes in the value of options may differ from the value at risk calculated using a linear approximation inherent in our calculation method. As a result, actual changes in the fair value of mark to market energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated value at risk, and such changes could have a material impact on our financial results. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through our issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument. Our risk management policy allows us to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations. In January 2006, we entered into a series of new interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps became effective on February 15, 2006 and are intended to hedge the risk associated with floating interest rates. For each of the interest rate swaps, we pay our counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest payment on a predetermined notional value, and we receive quarterly the equivalent of a floating interest payment based on 3 month LIBOR calculated on the same notional value. All payments by us and our counterparties are made quarterly, and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period. While the notional value of each of the swaps does not vary over time, the swaps are designed to mature sequentially. The total notional amount of these swaps as of February 25, 2006 was $2.15 billion. The notional amounts and maturities of each tranche of these swaps are as follows: Period of Swap Notional value Maturity 1 year $ 120 million March 31, 2007 2 year $ 140 million March 31, 2008 3 year $ 150 million March 31, 2009 4 year $ 190 million March 31, 2010 5 year $ 1.55 billion March 31, 2011 As of December 31, 2005, we and our consolidating subsidiaries had various interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling approximately $1.2 billion. If the swaps had been discontinued on December 31, 2005, we would have owed the counter parties approximately $33.1 million. Based on the investment grade rating of the counterparties, we believe that our exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by the counterparties to our hedging contracts is insignificant. We have both long and short term debt instruments that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2005, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a $8.3 million change in interest expense on a rolling 12 month basis. When our new senior unsecured notes and new credit agreement are included, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a $34 million change in interest expense on a rolling 12 month basis. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt was $2.8 billion, compared with the carrying amount of $2.7 billion. We estimate that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt by approximately $33 million. When our new senior unsecured notes and new credit agreement are included, we estimate that a 1% decrease in market rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt by approximately $456 million. 126 Table of Contents Liquidity Risk Our collateral posted in support of our management of our electric generation facilities fluctuates based on amount of the portfolio hedged using collateralized contracts and market price movements. Based on a sensitivity analysis a $1 per MWh increase or decrease in electricity prices would cause a change in margin collateral outstanding of approximately $13 million. This sensitivity uses simplified assumptions and may not reflect actual market movements. Credit Risk Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non performance or non payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. We monitor and manage the credit risk of NRG and its subsidiaries through credit policies which include an (i) established credit approval process, (ii) daily monitoring of counter party credit limits, (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, credit derivatives or prepayment arrangements, (iv) the use of payment netting agreements and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. We have credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if necessary. As of December 31, 2005, we held collateral support of approximately $205 million from counterparties. A portion of our credit risk is related to transactions that are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These transactions primarily consist of open positions from our marketing and risk management operation that are accounted for using mark to market accounting, as well as amounts owed by counterparties for transactions that settled but have not yet been paid. The following table highlights the credit quality and exposures related to these activities as of December 31, 2005: Exposure Before Net Collateral Collateral Exposure (In millions) Investment grade $ 518 $ 96 $ 422 Non investment grade 24 5 19 Not rated 164 25 139 Total $ 706 $ 126 $ 580 Investment grade 73 % 76 % 73 % Non investment grade 3 % 4 % 3 % Not rated 24 % 20 % 24 % Additionally, we have concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, energy marketing and trading companies and regional transmission operators. These concentrations of counterparties may impact NRGs overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory and other conditions. NRGs exposure to significant counterparties greater than 10% of the net exposure of approximately $580 million was approximately $386 million as of December 31, 2005. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any of its counterparties. Currency Exchange Risk We expect to continue to be subject to currency risks associated with foreign denominated distributions from our international investments. In the normal course of business, we may receive distributions denominated in the Euro, Australian Dollar and the Brazilian Real. We have historically engaged in a strategy of hedging foreign denominated cash flows through a program of matching currency inflows and outflows, and to 127 Table of Contents the extent required, fixing the U.S. Dollar equivalent of net foreign denominated distributions with currency forward and swap agreements with highly credit worthy financial institutions. We would expect to enter into similar transactions in the future if management believes it to be appropriate. As of December 31, 2005, neither we, nor any of our consolidating subsidiaries, had any material outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts.
