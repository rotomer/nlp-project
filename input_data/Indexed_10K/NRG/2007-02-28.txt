Executive Summary Overview NRG Energy, Inc., NRG, or the Company, is a wholesale power generation company with a significant presence in major competitive power markets in the United States. NRG is primarily engaged in the ownership, development, construction and operation of power generation facilities, the transacting in and trading of fuel and transportation services, and the trading of energy, capacity and related products in the United States and internationally. As of December 31, 2006, NRG had a total global portfolio of 223 active operating generation units at 51 power generation plants, with an aggregate generation capacity of approximately 24,175 MW. Within the United States, the Company has one of the largest and most diversified power generation portfolios in terms of geography, fuel type and dispatch levels, with approximately 22,940 MW of generation capacity in 207 active generating units at 45 plants. These power generation facilities are primarily located in Texas, (approximately 10,760 MW), and the Northeast (approximately 7,240 MW), South Central (approximately 2,850 MW) and the West (approximately 1,965 MW) regions of the United States, with approximately 125 MW from the Companys thermal assets. NRGs principal domestic power plants consist of a diversified mix of natural gas , coal , oil fired and nuclear facilities, representing approximately 45%, 34%, 16% and 5% of the Companys total domestic generation capacity, respectively. In addition, 15% of NRGs domestic generating facilities have dual or multiple fuel capacity, which allows plants to dispatch with the lowest cost fuel option, and consist primarily of baseload, 67 Table of Contents intermediate and peaking power generation facilities, which are referred to as the merit order, and also include thermal energy production plants. The sale of capacity and power from baseload generation facilities accounts for the majority of the Companys revenues and provides a stable source of cash flow. In addition, NRGs diverse generation portfolio provides the Company with opportunities to capture additional revenues by selling power during periods of peak demand, offering capacity or similar products to retail electric providers and others, and providing ancillary services to support system reliability. In addition, NRG is pursuing opportunities to repower existing facilities and develop new generation capacity in markets in which NRG currently owns assets in an initiative referred to as Repowering NRG. In connection with NRGs acquisition of Padoma Wind Power LLC, the Company has and will continue to actively evaluate and potentially develop or construct domestic terrestrial wind projects as part of the Repowering NRG program. Business Strategy NRGs strategy is to optimize the value of the Companys generation assets while using that asset base as a platform for growth and enhanced financial performance which can be sustained and expanded upon in the years to come. NRG plans to maintain and enhance the Companys position as a leading wholesale power generation company in the United States in a cost effective and risk mitigating manner in order to serve the bulk power requirements of NRGs existing customer base and other entities that offer load or otherwise consume wholesale electricity products and services in bulk. NRGs strategy includes the following elements: Pursue additional growth opportunities at existing sites NRG is favorably positioned to pursue growth opportunities through expansion of its existing generating capacity and development of new generating capacity at its existing facilities. NRG intends to invest in the Companys existing assets through plant improvements, repowerings, brownfield development and site expansions to meet anticipated requirements for additional capacity in NRGs core markets. In furtherance of this goal, NRG has initiated a company wide program, known as Repowering NRG, to develop, construct and operate new and enhanced power generation facilities at its existing sites, with an emphasis on new baseload capacity that is supported by long term power sales agreements and financed with limited or non recourse project financing. NRG expects that these efforts will provide one or more of the following benefits: improved heat rates; lower delivered costs; expanded electricity production capability; an improved ability to dispatch economically across the merit order; increased technological and fuel diversity; and reduced environmental impacts, including facilities that either have zero greenhouse gas emissions or can be equipped to capture and, eventually, sequester greenhouse gas emissions. Increase value from existing assets NRG has a highly diversified portfolio of power generation assets in terms of region, fuel type and dispatch levels. NRG will continue to focus on extracting value from its portfolio by improving plant performance, reducing costs and harnessing the Companys advantages of scale in the procurement of fuels and other commodities, parts and services, and in doing so improve the Companys return on invested capital, or ROIC a strategy that NRG has branded FORNRG, or Focus on ROIC@NRG. Maintain financial strength and flexibility NRG remains focused on cash flow and maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity, debt and equity in order to ensure continued access to capital for investment, to enhance risk adjusted returns and to provide flexibility in executing NRGs business strategy. NRG will continue to focus on maintaining operational and financial controls designed to ensure that the Companys financial position remains strong. At the same time, NRG expects to continue its practice of returning excess cash flows to its debt and equity investors on a regular basis. Reduce the volatility of the Companys cash flows through asset based commodity hedging activities NRG will continue to execute asset based risk management, hedging, marketing and trading strategies within well defined risk and liquidity guidelines in order to manage the value of the Companys physical and contractual assets. The Companys marketing and hedging philosophy is centered on generating stable returns from its portfolio of baseload power generation assets while preserving an ability to capitalize on strong spot market conditions and to capture the extrinsic value of the Companys intermediate and peaking facilities and portions of its baseload fleet. NRG believes that it can successfully execute this strategy by leveraging its expertise in marketing power and ancillary services, its knowledge of markets, its balanced financial structure and its diverse portfolio of power generation assets. 68 Table of Contents Pursue strategic acquisitions and divestures NRG will continue to pursue selective acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures to enhance its asset mix and competitive position in the Companys core regions to meet the fuel and dispatch requirements in these regions. NRG intends to concentrate on opportunities that present attractive risk adjusted returns. NRG will also opportunistically pursue other strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions or divestitures. Business Environment General Industry 2006 was yet another year of progress and transition for the power generation industry. The industry dynamics and external influences that are most likely to significantly affect the Company and the power generation industry in 2007 include: Emissions Environmental compliance policies on a federal and state level continue to accelerate in a variety of ways, presenting challenges to the industry as a result of various uncertainties. In the case of SO2 and NOx, the regulatory regime is well settled but the tightening standards taking effect in 2010 and 2014 have caused a need to add capital intensive back end controls. This remediation requirement has led to dramatic increases in, and uncertainty with respect to, the ultimate cost to comply with the stricter regulations. In the case of mercury (Hg), there is greater regulatory and technical uncertainty as various states have imposed, or are intending to impose, tougher standards than currently provided for under federal law and the technological solutions to comply with such standards are less certain both with respect to efficacy and cost. Finally, the move towards federal carbon regulation to combat global warming is gaining momentum but the timing, shape and ultimate disposition of that legislation and the impact it will have are unknown. Consolidation Two mega utility combinations (FPL Group Inc./Constellation Energy Group and Exelon Corp./PSEG) failed due to state regulatory opposition in 2006. While there are still likely to be some regulated utility mergers in the future, mergers and acquisitions activity in the power generation sector for the time being are likely to involve utility merchant or merchant merchant combinations and acquisitions by private equity funds or consortia of power generation assets, portfolios or entire companies. There may also be interest by foreign power companies, particularly European utilities, in the American power generation sector. Infrastructure Development In response to record peak demand, tightening reserve margins, persistently high and volatile natural gas prices and ever increasing environmental sensitivity, the power generation industry has announced significant expansion plans for both transmission and generation. In stark contrast to the previous wave of new power generation in the United States, which was almost exclusively natural gas fired, much of the new generation announced around the nation has focused on non gas fuel sources, including coal, nuclear and renewable sources. Capacity Markets Considerable progress was made in ISO NE and PJM towards approval and implementation of locational capacity markets. The CPUC also took steps towards establishing locational capacity requirements, thus a bilateral market for capacity. The objective of such market structures is to provide timely and accurate market signals to encourage new investment in transmission and new generation in the locations where the new investment is needed. Commodity Prices and Volatility Commodity prices have abated after hitting record highs during 2005. The single biggest driver on a national level for the downtrend in prices has been driven primarily by mild weather conditions resulting in excess gas storage due to below normal withdrawals. However, volatility continues to predominate the commodities market with many financial and hedge fund players seeking to participate and build up their trading positions in the energy sector. Skills Scarcity After more than a decade long contraction of the power generation industrys workforce, the industry finds itself poised for expansion, but hampered by an aging workforce, with current and projected shortages of experienced engineers, skilled operators, and maintenance workers. This skills deficit also has the potential to hamper the power generation industrys ability to design and construct the next wave of power generation infrastructure needed in this country. 69 Table of Contents Competition Competition Wholesale power generation is a capital intensive, commodity driven business with numerous industry participants. NRG competes on the basis of the location of its plants and owning multiple plants in its regions, which increases the stability and reliability of its energy supply. Wholesale power generation is basically a local business that is currently highly fragmented relative to other commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies NRG competes against depending on the market. Regulatory As an operator of power plants and a participant in the wholesale markets, NRG is subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These include CFTC, FERC, NRC, PUCT and other public utility commissions in certain states where NRGs generating assets are located. In addition, NRG is also subject to the market rules, procedures, and protocols of the various ISO markets in which NRG participates. These wholesale power markets are subject to ongoing legislative and regulatory changes. The Company cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on NRGs business. NRG supports the efficient operation of the wholesale markets; however, opposition to wholesale power markets has increased. Support for the mitigation of sellers has increased in order to reduce prices. In some of NRGs regions, interested parties have advocated for material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism, as well as proposals to re regulate the markets or require divestiture by generating companies to reduce their market share. Weather Weather conditions in the different regions of the United States influence the financial results of NRGs businesses. Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Companys results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas and oil are higher in the winter. However, all regions of North America typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG is typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once. Other Factors A number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for NRGs business. These factors include: seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand; extreme peak demands; available supply resources; transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions; location of NRGs generating facilities relative to the location of its load serving opportunities; procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations. These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in: weather conditions; market liquidity; 70 Table of Contents capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems; local transportation systems; and the nature and extent of electricity deregulation. Environmental Matters and Legal Proceedings NRG discusses details of its environmental matters in Item 15 Note 23, Environmental Matters, to its Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1, Business Environmental Matters, section. NRG discusses details of its legal proceedings in Item 15 Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, to its Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of this information is about costs that may be material to the Companys financial results. Impact of inflation on NRGs results Unless discussed specifically in the relevant segment, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the impact of inflation and changing prices (due to changes in exchange rates) on NRGs revenues and income from continuing operations was immaterial. Capital Allocation Strategy NRGs capital allocation philosophy includes reinvestment in its core facilities, maintenance of prudent debt levels and interest coverage, the regular return of capital to shareholders and investment in repowering opportunities. Each of these components is described further as follows: Reinvestment in Existing Assets Opportunities to invest in the existing business, including maintenance and environmental capital expenditures that improve operational performance, ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and expansion projects. Management of Debt Levels The Company uses several metrics to measure the efficiency of its capital structure and debt balances. Generally, the Companys targeted net debt to total capital ratio range is 45% to 60%. The Company intends in the normal course of business to continue to manage its debt levels towards the lower end of the range and may, from time to time, pay down its debt balances for a variety of reasons. Return of Capital to Shareholders The Companys debt instruments include restrictions on the amount of capital that can be returned to shareholders. The Company has in the past returned capital to shareholders while maintaining compliance with existing debt agreements and indentures. The Company expects to regularly return capital either through dividends or share repurchases to shareholders. Repowering Opportunities The Company intends to pursue repowering initiatives that enhance and diversify its portfolio and provide a targeted economic return to the Company. Known Trends and Uncertainties Initiation of a portfolio repowering effort to add approximately 10,350 MW of new multi fuel, multi technology generation capacity at NRGs existing domestic sites to meet growing demand in all of the Companys core domestic markets. Continued share repurchases through the Companys Capital Allocation Program. Increasing the baseload hedge profile to 59% in 2010, 65% in 2011 and 24% in 2012, to provide certainty around the Companys future cash flows. Significant events that affected NRGs results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 Operational Reset legacy Texas region long term out of market power contracts and gas swaps by negotiating to current market price levels resulting in a reduction in operating income of $135 million. 71 Table of Contents Total generation increased by 154% primarily due to the addition of the Texas region to the NRG total portfolio. Improved operating performance and new tolling agreements contributed to $97 million of higher operating income from the South Central region. A mild winter and summer coupled with weak power prices lowered generation demand for the Northeast regions generation assets by 18%. NRG recorded $187 million in refinancing costs and $599 million in interest expense primarily due to new debt facilities associated with the acquisition of NRG Texas. Record peak energy demand in each of the markets served by NRGs major business segments ranging with increases of 4% to 11% over previous records. Recognized $124 million in gains from risk management activities. Acquisitions/Dispositions On February 2, 2006, NRG acquired Texas Genco LLC. Texas Genco LLC and its affiliates are now wholly owned subsidiaries of NRG, and is managed and accounted for as a separate business segment referred to as Texas region. On August 30, 2006, NRG announced the completion of the sale of its 100% owned Flinders power station and related assets. NRG received approximately $242 million in cash and recognized an after tax gain on the sale of approximately $60 million. On March 31, 2006, NRG acquired Dynegys 50% ownership interest in WCP, and became the sole owner of WCPs 1,825 MW of generation in Southern California. The results of operations of WCP were consolidated as of April 1, 2006, prior to which, NRGs 50% ownership of WCP was recorded as an equity method investment. On November 8, 2006, NRG completed the sale of its Newport and Elk River Resource Recovery facilities, its Becker Ash Disposal facility as well as its ownership in NRG Processing Solutions, LLC, to Resource Recovery Technologies, LLC for approximately $22 million. The Company recognized a gain of approximately $5 million. Other On January 31, 2006, NRG finalized a settlement agreement with an equipment manufacturer related to certain turbine purchase agreements. Upon finalization of the settlement, NRG recorded a total of $67 million of other income, of which $35 million was related to the discharge of accounts payable previously recorded and $32 million was related to the receiving and recording of the equipment at fair value. Incurred approximately $36 million in development costs primarily related to Repowering NRG program. 72 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations 2006 compared to 2005 The following table provides selected financial information for NRG Energy, Inc., for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Energy revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1,323 million from $1,870 million to $3,193 million, with 51% contracted compared to 2005 when 14% was contracted. The current years results were favorably impacted by the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, now referred to as the Companys Texas region, which contributed $3,088 million to operating revenues including $1,726 million of energy revenues, $849 million of capacity revenues and $609 million of contract amortization revenues. In addition, the acquisition of Dynegys 50% interest in WCP contributed $141 million to total operating revenues. Excluding the Companys Texas region, the Hedge Reset transaction and WCP, total operating revenues for the current year decreased by $36 million. Energy revenues, excluding the Texas region and WCP, declined by $475 million, or 25%, as generation demand for the Northeast regions intermediate and peaking plants declined by 54%, accompanied by a 19% to 23% year over year decline in power prices in the Northeast regions three major markets. Reduced revenues due to lower generation were partially offset by $446 million in gains from risk management results as such activities swung from last years loss of $292 million to a gain of $154 million, primarily due to the decline in settled and forward prices of electricity and natural gas. Capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1,516 million compared to $563 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $953 million. Of this increase, $849 million was related to the Companys Texas region, primarily from auction sales. In addition, capacity revenues increased $64 million in the West region due to the acquisition of WCP. Increased capacity revenues, reflective of higher capacity prices for the New York Rest of State market, led to a $30 million increase in the Northeast regions 2006 yearly capacity revenue. The South Central regions capacity revenues also grew by $9 million as pricing increased due to increased peak demand. 74 Table of Contents Risk Management Activity The following table shows NRGs risk management activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment for the year ended December 31, 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2006 South Texas Northeast Central Other Total (In millions) Financial revenues Net losses on settled positions, or financial revenues (152 ) (10 ) (6 ) (3 ) (171 ) Subtotal net losses on settled positions, or financial revenues (152 ) (10 ) (6 ) (3 ) (171 ) Mark to market results Reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on settled positions 90 90 Net unrealized gains on open positions related to economic hedges 122 50 172 Net unrealized gains on open positions related to trading activity 14 19 33 Subtotal mark to market results 122 154 19 295 Total derivative gain/(losses) $ (30 ) $ 144 $ 13 $ (3 ) $ 124 Risk management activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment resulted in a total derivative gain of approximately $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a $292 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2006, these losses were comprised of $171 million in settled financial revenue losses and $295 million of mark to market gains. The $171 million loss in financial revenues represents the settled value for financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and were primarily related to $152 million in losses of gas swaps acquired with the purchase of Texas Genco LLC. Of the $295 million in mark to market gains, $172 million represents the change in the fair value of forward sales of electricity and fuel, including $28 million of hedge accounting ineffectiveness related to hedge contracts in the Companys Texas region due to a decline in the correlation between natural gas and power prices. In addition, $90 million of the $295 million mark to market gains represents the reversal of mark to market losses, which ultimately settled as financial revenues. NRG also recognized a $33 million gain associated with the Companys trading activity. Since NRGs risk management activities are intended to mitigate the risk of commodity price movements on revenues and cost of energy sold, the changes in these results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather taken together with the effects of pricing and cost changes on energy revenues (which are recorded net of financial instrument hedges that qualify for hedge accounting treatment) and costs of energy. In late 2005 and in 2006, NRG hedged a portion of the Companys 2006 and 2007 Northeast regions generation. Since that time, the settled and forward prices of electricity have decreased, resulting in the recognition of mark to market forward sales and the settlement of such positions at reduced losses. Hedge Reset In November 2006, NRG executed a series of transactions designed to both extend and strengthen the Companys baseload hedging positions and to enable further optimization of the Companys ongoing Capital Allocation Program. It involved net settling legacy Texas region long term power contracts and gas swaps by negotiating prices to current market levels with certain counterparties. This resulted in the accelerated amortization of approximately $1,073 million of out of market power contracts and $145 million of gas swaps derivative liability offset by a payment of approximately $1,347 million to the counterparties, for a net reduction of approximately $129 million in the Companys total operating revenues. In addition, as part of NRGs Hedge Reset transactions, the Company recorded $6 million of costs related to the transaction. 75 Table of Contents Cost of Operations Cost of operations includes cost of energy, operating and maintenance expenses, and non income tax expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2006, cost of operations was $3,276 million or 58% of total operating revenues compared to $1,838 million, or 76%, of total operating revenues for 2005, an increase of $1,438 million. This increase in absolute terms, but decrease in relative percentage terms, was primarily due to the acquisition of the Companys Texas region which incurred costs of $1,669 million. Cost of energy which includes fuels, purchased power, and cost contract amortization increased from $1,431 million for 2005 to $2,460 million in 2006. The increase of $1,029 million was primarily due to the Companys Texas region, which incurred $1,276 million in cost of energy and WCP, which incurred $79 million of energy cost this year, partially offset by lower cost of energy in the Companys Northeast region. Excluding NRG Texas and WCP, cost of energy decreased by $326 million. This decrease was driven by $254 million in lower cost of energy in the Northeast region, primarily due to $143 million lower oil costs and $101 million in lower gas fuel costs related to lower generation from oil and gas fired assets of approximately 70% and 45%, respectively. The South Central regions cost of energy was $66 million lower in 2006, as higher coal plant availability and increased utilization of the regions tolling agreements reduced the need to purchase energy to support contract load requirements. Other operating costs increased in 2006 by $410 million to $816 million, $393 million related to the acquisition of NRG Texas and $33 million for WCP. Excluding the impact of NRG Texas and WCP, other operating costs were $16 million lower than last year primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs, which benefited in the second quarter 2006 from an accrual reversal of $18 million related to a favorable court decision in a station service dispute at NRGs Western New York plants. In addition, as part of NRGs Hedge Reset transactions, the Company recorded $6 million of costs related to the transaction. Depreciation and Amortization NRGs annual depreciation and amortization expense for 2006 and 2005 was $593 million and $162 million, respectively. The Texas regions depreciation and amortization comprised $413 million of the $431 million year over year increase. General, Administrative and Development, or G&A NRGs G&A costs for 2006 were $316 million compared to $181 million in the previous year. Corporate costs represented $143 million, or 3% of 2006 total operating revenues and $112 million, or 5% of the Companys 2005 total operating revenues. G&A costs were adversely impacted by $6 million of costs associated with the unsolicited acquisition offer by Mirant Corporation and approximately $14 million of NRG Texas integration costs. The balance of the corporate increase was mainly comprised of increased staffing and administrative costs after the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. Total G&A costs, excluding WCP and the Companys Texas region remained flat at $181 million. NRG also incurred approximately $36 million in development expenses in 2006 to support its recently announced Repowering NRG program. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity earnings from NRGs investments in unconsolidated affiliates were $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decline of approximately 42%. The decline in earnings was primarily due to the sale of certain non core assets that were completed during 2006 as well as the Companys purchase of WCP. NRGs purchase of the remaining 50% interest in WCP accounted for $21 million of the decline, as the results of WCP were fully consolidated as of March 31, 2006. As part of that transaction, NRG sold its 50% interest in the Rocky Road investment, which accounted for $7 million of the decline in total equity earnings. In addition, NRGs Enfield investment, which was sold on April 1, 2005, earned $16 million during 2005. Sales of other equity investments in 2006 included James River, Cadillac and certain Latin American power funds. Declines in equity earnings as a result of these sales were partially offset by a $4 million improvement in equity income from the Companys MIBRAG investment. MIBRAG experienced improved results compared to 2005 as a result of fewer customer outages. 76 Table of Contents Write Downs and Gains/(Losses) on Sales of Equity Method Investments During 2006, NRG continued to divest of its non core assets by selling the Companys interests in James River and Cadillac, as well as interests in certain Latin American power funds for a pre tax loss of $6 million, a pre tax gain of $11 million and a pre tax gain of $3 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, NRG recorded a $31 million loss due to the sale and impairment of certain equity investments. On April 1, 2005, NRG sold its 25% interest in Enfield, resulting in net pre tax proceeds of $65 million and a pre tax gain of $12 million. In 2005, NRG also sold its interest in Kendall and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $4 million. These gains on sales were offset by approximately $47 million in impairment charges recorded last year. In December 2005, NRG executed an agreement with Dynegy to sell the Companys 50% interest in Rocky Road LLC in conjunction with NRGs purchase of Dynegys 50% interest in WCP. Based on the terms of the transaction which valued the Companys investment in Rocky Road at $45 million, NRG impaired its interest in Rocky Road by writing down the value of the investment by approximately $20 million. The sale of Rocky Road closed on March 31, 2006. In 2005, NRG also recorded an impairment of $27 million on its investment in the Saguaro power plant. With the expiration of the plants long term gas supply contract, the Saguaro power plant became exposed to the risk of fluctuating natural gas prices beginning in the second half of 2005, triggering a permanent write down of NRGs investment value in Saguaro. Other Income, Net Other income increased by $102 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $160 million compared to the same period in 2005. Other income in 2006 was favorably impacted by $67 million of income associated with a non cash settlement with an equipment manufacturer related to turbine purchase agreements entered into in 1999 and 2001, a $13 million non cash gain associated with the discharge of liabilities upon dissolution of an inactive legal entity, and $5 million from the favorable settlement with respect to post closing adjustments on the acquisition of the Companys western New York plants in 1998 and 1999. In 2005, NRG recorded an $11 million gain from the settlement related to the Companys TermoRio project in Brazil and a contingent gain of $4 million related to the sale of a former project, the Crockett Cogeneration Facility, which was sold in 2002. Other income was also favorably impacted in 2006 by $25 million of higher interest income related to higher levels of cash and more efficient management of cash balances. Refinancing Expenses Refinancing expenses incurred in 2006 and 2005 were $187 million and $65 million, respectively. In the first quarter 2006, NRG partially financed the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC through borrowings under new debt facilities and repaid and terminated previous debt facilities. As a result of this financing, the Company incurred $178 million of refinancing expenses: $127 million was related to the premium paid to NRGs previous debt holders, $34 million for the amortization of the remaining balance of a bridge loan commitment entered into on September 30, 2005, and $31 million related to write offs of deferred financing costs associated with NRGs previous debt, and a credit of $14 million related to a debt premium write off. In 2005, NRG redeemed and purchased a total of approximately $645 million of the Companys second priority notes. As a result of the redemption and purchases, NRG incurred approximately $54 million in premiums and write offs of deferred financing costs. NRG also incurred an additional $11 million in refinancing fees during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to the amortization of a bridge loan commitment fee that the Company paid related to acquisition financing. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $599 million compared to $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to interest on new debt issued to finance the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. See Item 15 Note 3, Business Acquisitions and Dispositions, and Note 11, Debt and Capital Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the acquisition and the related financing. As part of the refinancing, NRG replaced its previous senior secured term loan with a new $3.575 billion senior secured term loan. In addition, NRG retired $1.1 billion of its 8% second priority notes and issued $3.6 billion in senior unsecured notes with a weighted average interest rate of 7.33%. 77 Table of Contents In the first quarter 2006, NRG entered into interest rate swaps with the objective of fixing the interest rate on a portion of the Companys new Senior Credit Facility. These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS 133, and any impact associated with ineffectiveness was immaterial to NRGs financial results. For the year ended December 31, 2006, NRG had deferred gains of $16 million in other comprehensive income associated with these swaps. Also See Item 15 Note 11, Debt and Capital Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on these interest rate swaps. In addition, NRG designated an existing fixed to floating interest rate swap, previously as a hedge of NRGs 8% second priority notes, into a fair value hedge of the Senior Notes, which NRG closed on February 2, 2006. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was approximately $325 million and approximately $47 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The overall effective tax rate was approximately 36.9% and 39.5% for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to a basis difference relating to disbursements from the Companys disputed claims reserve, a change in the Companys state effective income tax rate due to the acquisition of the Companys Texas region, and the Companys earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (In millions except otherwise stated) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 880 $ 119 Tax at 35% 308 42 State taxes, net of federal benefit 34 (1 ) Foreign operations (23 ) (16 ) Section 965 taxable dividend 5 Subpart F taxable income 11 19 Valuation allowance, including change in state effective rate (10 ) 22 Change in state effective tax rate 21 (22 ) Claimant Reserve settlements (28 ) Permanent differences, reserves, other 12 (2 ) Income tax expense $ 325 $ 47 Effective income tax rate 36.9 % 39.5 % The Companys effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the Companys geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and the Companys adjustment of valuation allowance in accordance with SFAS 109. These factors and others, including the Companys history of pre tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize the Companys deferred tax assets. The Companys valuation allowance has been reduced in 2006 due to earnings generated from business operations and due to the acquisition of the Companys Texas region. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax Expense NRG classifies as discontinued operations the income from operations and gains/losses recognized on the sale of projects that were sold or were deemed to have met the required criteria for such classification pending final disposition. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, NRG recorded income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense of $66 million and $12 million, respectively. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 were comprised of the results of Flinders, Audrain and Resource Recovery. Discontinued operations for 2005 consisted of the results of the Flinders, Audrain, Resource Recovery, Northbrook New York LLC, Northbrook Energy LLC and NRG McClain LLC. NRG closed on the sale of Flinders during the third quarter 2006 and recognized an after tax gain of approximately $60 million from the sale. Discontinued operations for the 78 Table of Contents full year 2005 included an $11 million gain on the disposition of NRGs Northbrook New York and Northbrook Energy operations. 2005 compared to 2004 The following table provides selected financial information for NRG Energy, Inc., for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 1,870 $ 1,205 55 % Capacity revenue 563 612 (8 ) Thermal revenue 124 112 11 Risk management activities (292 ) 61 N/A Contract amortization 9 (6 ) N/A Other revenues 156 120 30 Total operating revenues 2,430 2,104 15 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of operations 1,838 1,290 42 Depreciation and amortization 162 179 (9 ) General, administrative and development 181 197 (8 ) Impairment charges 6 45 (87 ) Reorganization charges (13 ) N/A Corporate relocation charges 6 16 (63 ) Total operating costs and expenses 2,193 1,714 28 Operating Income 237 390 (39 ) Other Income/(Expense) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 104 160 (35 ) Write downs and gains/(losses) on sales of equity method investments (31 ) (16 ) 94 Other income, net 58 22 164 Refinancing expenses (65 ) (72 ) (10 ) Interest expense (184 ) (255 ) (28 ) Total other expenses (118 ) (161 ) (27 ) Income from Continuing Operations before income tax expense 119 229 (48 ) Income tax expense 47 74 (36 ) Income from Continuing Operations 72 155 (54 ) Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense 12 31 (61 ) Net Income $ 84 $ 186 (55 ) Business Metrics Average natural gas price Henry Hub ($/MMbtu) 8.89 5.89 51 % N/A 79 Table of Contents Total Operating Revenues Total operating revenues were $2,430 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $2,104 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $326 million. Energy revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $665 million from $1,205 million to $1,870 million. Of the $1,870 million, 86% was merchant as compared to 66% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in energy revenue was driven by both increased prices and increased merchant generation from the Companys Northeast assets. Energy revenues from NRGs domestic coal assets increased by $314 million, primarily due to increased power prices, as generation from the Companys domestic coal fired assets decreased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004. This decrease in generation was due to both planned and unplanned outages at the Companys Huntley, Indian River, and Big Cajun II plants during the second and fourth quarters of 2005. Energy revenues from NRGs gas fired assets in New York City increased by $176 million, which included $23 million in NYISO final settlement payments. Of the remaining $153 million increase, price and generation contributed equally. Energy revenues from NRGs oil fired assets rose by $209 million, 86% due to higher volumes following an increase in summer demand as the generation from these assets increased by 122% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004. In addition, a one time payment of $39 million from the Connecticut Light and Power settlement contributed to energy revenue during the second quarter of 2004. Capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $563 million compared to $612 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a reduction of $49 million. The decrease in capacity revenues compared to the prior year was primarily due to a loss of $56 million in capacity revenues from the Companys Kendall facility, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004, and the expiration of the South Central regions Rockford tolling agreement, which expired in May 2005 and reduced capacity revenues by $23 million. Capacity revenues from the Companys western New York plants decreased by $10 million due to the addition of new generation and increased imports in New York, which depressed capacity prices for the Companys assets in the western New York market during the first half of 2005. This loss was offset by a $44 million increase in capacity revenues from the Companys Connecticut assets, of which $24 million was related to the Connecticut RMR settlement agreement. Thermal revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $124 million and $112 million, respectively. Increased generation due to the warmer weather during the summer of 2005 and an increase in contract rates from the Companys thermal operations positively contributed to the improved results. Other revenues include emission allowance sales, natural gas sales, and expense recovery revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2005, other revenues totaled $165 million, compared to $114 million for the same period in 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher emission allowance revenues and higher physical gas sales, which were partially offset by lower expense recovery revenues. The increase in gas sales of approximately $32 million was primarily related to a new gas sale agreement entered into in the third quarter of 2005 by the South Central region, where revenues from gas sales increased by $23 million. NRG entered into this agreement in conjunction with power purchase agreements to minimize market purchases by the region during peak months. Finally, expense recovery revenues in 2005 were $29 million lower compared to 2004. Expense recovery revenues associated with the Companys Connecticut RMR agreements reached its maximum payment during the first quarter 2005. Risk Management Activity The total derivative loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 was approximately $292 million, comprised of $138 million in settled financial revenue losses and $154 million of mark to market losses. The $138 million loss in financial revenues represents the settled value for the year 2005 of financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Of the $154 million of mark to market losses, $122 million represented the change in fair value of forward sales of electricity and fuel, and $59 million represented the reversal of mark to market gains which ultimately settled as financial revenues. These activities primarily supported the Companys Northeast assets. 80 Table of Contents The following table shows NRGs risk management activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment for the year ended December 31, 2005. Year Ended December 31, 2005 South Northeast Central Other Total (In millions) Net losses on settled positions, or financial revenues $ (132 ) $ (1 ) $ (5 ) $ (138 ) Mark to market results Reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on settled positions (59 ) (59 ) Net unrealized losses on open positions related to economic hedges (121 ) (1 ) (122 ) Net unrealized gains on open positions related to trading activity 27 27 Subtotal mark to market results (153 ) (1 ) (154 ) Total derivative loss $ (285 ) $ (2 ) $ (5 ) $ (292 ) Since NRGs economic hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk of commodity price movements on revenues and cost of energy sold, the changes in such results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather taken together with the effects of pricing and cost changes on energy revenues and costs of energy. In the fourth quarter of 2004 and during the course of 2005, NRG hedged much of its calendar year 2005 and 2006 Northeast generation. Since that time, the settled and forward prices of electricity have risen, driven by the extreme weather conditions in the summer of 2005. While this increase in electricity prices benefited NRGs generation portfolio compared to 2004 with higher energy revenues, it is also the reason for the mark to market recognition of the forward sales and the settlement of positions as losses. Cost of Operations Cost of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $1,838 million. Cost of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $1,290 million, or 61% of total operating revenues. The increase was primarily related to higher cost of energy, which increased by $506 million to $1,431 million, or 59% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $925 million, or 44% of revenues for the same period, in 2004. The increase in cost of energy as a percentage of revenues was driven by both higher prices and generation in the Companys Northeast region and higher purchased energy and gas sales in the Companys South Central region. Total gas costs increased by $162 million, with $124 million attributable to the Companys New York City assets, of which approximately $15 million was due to increased gas purchases for resale and approximately $67 million was due to increased generation. The South Central regions gas costs also increased by $31 million due to physical gas purchases related to a new gas sale agreement entered into in the third quarter of 2005 to support certain tolling arrangements. Total oil costs for the Company increased by $164 million, 65% due to increased generation from the Companys oil fired assets, with the remainder due to an increase in price. Total coal costs increased by $71 million as a result of higher coal prices for the Companys domestic coal fired assets, as overall generation from the Companys coal fired assets decreased for the year ended December 31, 2005 by 5%, compared to the same period in 2004, due to both planned and forced outages at the Companys Huntley, Indian River and Big Cajun II facilities. The increase in coal prices was related to new low sulfur coal and rail contracts, which became effective in April 2005. In addition, NRGs Indian River plant, which uses a higher portion of eastern coal, experienced a significant cost increase in 2005. The Company has increased its percentage blend of low sulfur coal over the year as compared to the same period last year. This had the effect of mitigating the increase in coal and coal transportation costs, as low sulfur coal prices have not increased as much as regular coal prices. Total purchased energy increased by $102 million due to increases at the Companys South Central region. Higher long term contract load demand due to the extreme weather, a 100 MW around the clock sale to Entergy, a tolling agreement, and the forced outages during the second quarter 2005, required South Central to purchase energy to meet its contract load obligations. Other operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $406 million compared to $365 million in the comparable period of 2004, an increase of $41 million. This increase was driven by a $34 million increase in normal and maintenance costs as a result of more major maintenance projects and extensive outages in 2005 81 Table of Contents compared to 2004. The low sulfur coal conversions and turbine overhauls of the Companys western New York plants and Indian River plant was a main focus for many of the major maintenance and outages in 2005. The South Central region also went through a significant outage to install a low NOx burner on one of its units and an additional outage was completed in the fall of 2005 to address reliability issues experienced at the Big Cajun II unit earlier in the year. In 2004, a settlement with a third party vendor regarding auxiliary power charges reduced 2004 operating and maintenance expenses by $7 million. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $162 million and $179 million, respectively. The decrease in depreciation and amortization from 2005 to 2004 was primarily due to the 2004 sale of the Companys Kendall plant, which contributed approximately $14 million in depreciation and amortization expense during 2004. General, Administrative and Development, or G&A G&A costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $181 million, compared to $197 million for the same period in 2004, a decrease of $16 million. Corporate costs represented $108 million, or 4% of revenues and $132 million, or 6% of revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. G&A costs were favorably impacted by approximately $11 million in reduced bad debt expense associated with notes receivable from third parties. In addition, external consulting expenses decreased in 2005 as compared to 2004 by approximately $12 million, primarily related to reduced tax and legal consulting. These favorable impacts were offset by a $5 million increase in information technology related expenses, primarily associated with increased compliance costs related to Sarbanes Oxley and the relocation of the Companys corporate headquarters from Minneapolis. Corporate Relocation Charges For the year ended December 31, 2005, charges related to the companys corporate relocation activities were approximately $6 million, as compared to $16 million in 2004. Included in 2005s charges was approximately $3 million related to lease abandonment charges associated with the Companys former Minneapolis office, with the remainder related to relocation, recruitment and transition costs. In 2004, NRG recorded $16 million primarily related to employee severance and termination benefits and employee related transition costs. NRG completed the physical move of the Companys corporate headquarters in 2004 when the majority of costs were incurred. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates For the year ended December 31, 2005, equity earnings from the Companys investments in unconsolidated affiliates were $104 million compared to $160 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $56 million. NRGs earnings in WCP accounted for $22 million and $69 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in WCPs equity earnings was due to the expiration of the CDWR contract in December 2004. The equity earnings of the Companys Enfield investment were $13 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004, which was sold on April 1, 2005. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2005, the results of the Companys Enfield investment included approximately $12 million of unrealized gains associated with mark to market increases in the fair value of energy related derivative instruments, compared to $23 million of unrealized gains for the same period in 2004. Other equity investments included in the Companys 2005 results included MIBRAG and Gladstone, which comprised $26 million and $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, respectively. For the comparable period in 2004, MIBRAG and Gladstone earned $21 million and $18 million, respectively. MIBRAGs equity earnings for 2004 were negatively impacted by an outage at the Companys Schkopau plant; in addition, MIBRAG recorded a lower asset retirement obligation in 2005 as compared to 2004. Gladstones earnings in 2005 were greater than 2004 due to lower major maintenance expense. 82 Table of Contents Write Downs and Gains/(Losses) on Sales of Equity Method Investments For the year ended December 31, 2005, NRG recorded a $31 million loss due to the sale and impairment of certain equity investments as the Company continued the divestiture of its non core assets. On April 1, 2005, NRG sold its 25% interest in Enfield, resulting in net pre tax proceeds of $65 million and a pre tax gain of $12 million, including post closing working capital adjustments. In 2005, NRG also sold its interest in Kendall for $5 million in pre tax proceeds and a pre tax gain of approximately $4 million. These gains on sales were offset by approximately $47 million in impairment charges recorded during the year. In December 2005, NRG executed an agreement with Dynegy to sell the Companys 50% interest in Rocky Road LLC in conjunction with NRGs purchase of Dynegys 50% interest in WCP. Based on the terms of the transaction, which valued the Companys investment in Rocky Road at $45 million, NRG impaired its interest in Rocky Road by writing down the value of the investment by approximately $20 million. NRG also recorded an impairment of $27 million on its investment in Saguaro. With the expiration of its gas supply contract, Saguaro began recording operating losses during the second half of 2005, triggering a permanent write down to NRGs investment value in Saguaro. For the year ended December 31, 2004, NRG sold its Loy Yang investment, which resulted in a $1 million loss, the Companys interest in Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership for a $5 million loss, and several NEO investments for a $4 million loss. These losses were offset by a $1 million gain associated with the sale of Calpine Cogeneration. Also during 2004, NRG recorded a $7 million impairment charge on its investment in James River LLC based on an estimated sale value from a prospective buyer. Other Income, Net For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Companys other income increased by $36 million as compared to the same period in 2004, to $58 million. Other income in 2005 was favorably impacted by a $14 million gain from the settlement related to the Companys TermoRio project in Brazil and a gain of approximately $4 million related to the resolution of a contingency from the sale of a former project, the Crockett Cogeneration Facility, which was sold in 2002. Other income in 2005 was also favorably impacted by $14 million of higher interest income related to more efficient management of the Companys cash balances. These favorable results were offset by a $3 million reserve relating to the ongoing TermoRio litigation. Refinancing Expenses Refinancing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $65 million and $72 million, respectively. During 2005, as part of the Companys continuing effort to manage its capital structure, NRG redeemed and purchased a total of $645 million of its second priority notes. As a result of the redemption and purchases, the Company incurred $55 million in premiums and write offs of deferred financing costs. NRG also incurred an additional $11 million in refinancing fees during 2005 related to the amortization of a bridge loan commitment fee that the Company paid related to the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. As part of the Companys financing in connection with the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, NRG paid a bridge loan commitment fee of approximately $45 million to ensure that the Company would have the proper financing in place for the acquisition. This amount was amortized over time, and during 2005 NRG amortized approximately $11 million to refinancing expense. The remaining balance of this amount was expensed during the first quarter of 2006 as the Company finalized the financing related to the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. For the year ended December 31, 2004, NRG refinanced certain amounts of the Companys term loans with additional corporate level debt on better terms, which resulted in $15 million of prepayment penalties and a $15 million write off of deferred financing costs. Additionally, NRG refinanced its Senior Credit Facility in December 2004 and recorded $14 million of prepayment penalties and a $27 million of write off related to the Companys deferred financing costs. 83 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $184 million as compared to $255 million for the same period in 2004, a reduction of $71 million. Interest expense was favorably impacted by the sale of the Kendall facility, which incurred $25 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2004. Additionally, the refinancing of the Companys Senior Credit Facility on December 23, 2004, lowered the interest related to the Facility by 212.5 basis points. In addition, the redemption and purchases of $645 million of the Companys second priority notes during 2005 reduced interest expense on the Companys corporate debt by approximately $50 million. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was approximately $47 million and $74 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The overall effective tax rate was 39.5% and 32.3% for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to the Companys earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. NRGs 2005 domestic effective income tax increased due to the gain on the sale of the Companys Enfield investment and the taxable dividend received pursuant to the American Job Creation Act of 2004. The Companys effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the Companys geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and the adjustment of valuation allowances in accordance with SFAS 109. These factors and others, including the Companys history of pre tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax Expense For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, NRG recorded income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes of approximately $12 million and $31 million, respectively, as the Company continued to divest certain non core assets. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 consist of Flinders, Audrain, Resource Recovery, the Northbrook New York and Northbrook Energy assets and various expenses related to the final settlements of McClain. For the year ended December 31, 2004, discontinued operations consisted of the results of Flinders, Audrain, Resource Recovery, the two Northbrook entities, McClain, Penobscot Energy Recovery Company, or PERC, Compania Boliviana De Energia Electrica S.A. Bolivian Power Company Limited, or Cobee, Hsin Yu, LSP Energy (Batesville) and four NEO Corporation projects (NEO Nashville LLC, NEO Hackensack LLC, NEO Prima Deshecha and NEO Tajiguas LLC). With the exception of Flinders, Audrain, Resource Recovery, Northbrook New York and Northbrook Energy, all discontinued operations were sold prior to December 31, 2004. 84 Table of Contents Results of Operations Regional Discussions Texas Region The following table provides selected financial information for the Texas region for the period ended December 31, 2006.

The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. (b) For the period February 2, 2006 to December 31, 2006 only. Operating Income For the year ended December 31, 2006, operating income for the Texas region was $881 million. A strong operating performance from the regions fleet contributed to these results, with the regions generating capacity operating at 90.7% availability, including baseload availability of 91.6%. Total generation for the year was approximately 45 million MWh, of which 74% were sold under long term agreements, with total generation sold of approximately 46 million MWh. The difference between MWh sold and MWh generated represents MWh purchased from the marketplace. In August 2006, ERCOT set a new record for peak demand of 63,056 MWh on August 17, which the regions baseload and gas assets met. The strong operating performance was partially offset by approximately $135 million in losses associated with the Companys Hedge Reset transaction. 85 Table of Contents Operating Revenues Total operating revenues from the Texas region for the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately $3,088 million. Operating revenues included $1,726 million in energy revenues, of which 73% were contracted. Capacity revenues totaled $849 million, of which $343 million was related to capacity sales from the Companys investment in the STP nuclear generation facility. In addition, the region recorded $609 million of contract amortization revenues. For a further discussion on NRGs Hedge Reset transaction, see the Consolidated Results of Operations and Item 15 Note 6, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Risk Management Activity The total derivative loss for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $30 million, which was comprised of $152 million in losses associated with the settled positions of gas swaps, which were offset by $28 million in gains related to hedge accounting ineffectiveness due to a change in the correlation between natural gas and power prices, as well as $94 million in gains representing the change in the fair value of forward sales of electricity. Cost of Energy Cost of energy for the Texas region was approximately $1,276 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Coal and lignite costs were $473 million for the year, gas fuel costs were $545 million and nuclear fuel related expenses were $56 million. These costs directly relate to the generation from the Texas regions coal fired, gas fired and nuclear fired units. Coal costs included $113 million of lignite coal used at the regions Limestone coal plant. Also included in cost of energy was an emissions allowance expense of $39 million, purchased power of $69 million, and $85 million in cost contract amortization. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the Texas region for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $518 million, or 17% of the regions total operating revenues. These costs include $335 million of operating and maintenance expenses of which 53% represents normal and major maintenance expenses. The $177 million of normal and major maintenance expenses was comprised of $80 million related to spring and fall planned outages at the regions W.A. Parish and Limestone plants. Due to these outages, both plants gained capacity via uprates. The regions gas plants also incurred approximately $31 million in maintenance costs related to outages, while STP incurred approximately $66 million in maintenance costs, primarily related to refueling outages. The Texas region also recorded approximately $57 million in property tax expense. In addition, the Texas region incurred $125 million of G&A expense, of which $50 million was related to corporate allocations and $14 million related to development cost in support of the regions Repowering NRG program. 86 Table of Contents Northeast Region 2006 compared to 2005 The following table provides selected financial information for the Northeast region for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 966 $ 1,444 (33 )% Capacity revenue 321 291 10 Risk Management Activities 144 (285 ) N/A Other revenues 112 104 8 Total operating revenues 1,543 1,554 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 615 869 (29 ) Depreciation and amortization 89 74 20 Other operating expenses 378 393 (4 ) Operating Income $ 461 $ 218 111 MWh sold (in thousands) 13,309 16,246 (18 ) MWh generated (in thousands) 13,309 16,246 (18 ) Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 71.55 $ 91.98 (22 ) Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 653 801 (18 ) CDDs 30 year rolling average 537 537 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 5,417 6,162 (12 )% HDDs 30 year rolling average 6,261 6,261 (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. An HDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. Operating Income For the year ended December 31, 2006, operating income for the Northeast region was $461 million, compared to $218 million for the same period in 2005, an increase of $243 million. This increase was due to $144 million in mark to market gains from risk management activities, compared to a $285 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2005. The favorable gain from risk management activities was largely due to weak forward power prices, which resulted in substantial unrealized gains in the regions forward positions for the year ended December 31, 2006. Power prices were weaker in 2006 relative to 2005, driven by gas price volatility following Hurricanes Rita and Katrina in 2005, and a mild winter in January, February and December. The mild weather reduced demand for natural gas, with average prices falling as much as 22% year over year. Falling natural gas prices reduced annual average power prices in the New York, NEPOOL and PJM markets by 23%, 20% and 19%, respectively. The mild weather also led to an 18% decline in power generation for the Companys Northeast region to 13.3 million MWh in 2006, compared to 16.2 million MWh in 2005. Declines in generation from the regions oil fired assets declined by nearly 2 million MWh, representing 66% of the overall Northeast regions generation 87 Table of Contents decrease. Half of this decline was attributable to the regions Western New York plants, which had more run time in 2005 due to that years cold January winter. Total Operating Revenues Total operating revenues from NRGs Northeast region totaled $1,543 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $1,554 million for the same period in 2005, a decrease of $11 million. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 included $966 million in energy revenues, compared to $1,444 million for the same period in 2005, a decrease of $478 million. Of this $478 million decrease, $318 million can be attributed to the regions New York assets, which reflect lower generation from the regions Oswego plant and lower realized price from generation from the regions baseload coal plants. In addition, the region had $23 million of adjustments in 2005 relating to prior year NYISO settlements and a $6 million reversal of a reserve due to a favorable court decision regarding spinning reserve payments. Capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $321 million, compared to $291 million for the same period in 2005. Of this increase, $28 million was due to higher capacity revenues in the New York State market. New York capacity revenues outside of New York City drove the increase in 2006, as increased demand for capacity, coupled with a decline in imports of capacity into the market, pushed clearing prices higher. Capacity prices were also favorably impacted in the regions New England market by $16 million due to the new LFRM market and the new transition capacity market. The Northeast region also earned $9 million more in RMR payments in 2006 with the approval of new RMR agreements. These were partially offset by $23 million of reserve reversals in 2005 following the settlement of prior year RMR agreements. Other revenues which include emission allowance sales, natural gas sales, and expense recovery revenues, totaled $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $104 million in the same period in 2005, an increase of $8 million. This increase was primarily related to $17 million in higher emission allowance sales as the Company sold emission allowances in lieu of generation during the first quarter 2006. Higher emission allowance revenues were partially offset by lower gas sales of $2 million, lower ancillary revenues of $3 million and lack of cost recovery revenues of $5 million related to the 2005 RMR agreements. Risk Management Activity The total derivative gain for the year was $144 million, comprised of $10 million in financial revenue losses and $154 million of unrealized mark to market gains. The $10 million loss of financial revenues represents the settled value for the year of all financial instruments, including financial swaps and options on power. Of the $154 million of mark to market gains, $50 million represented the fair value of forward sales of electricity and fuel transactions to support the regions physical asset position, with $14 million of mark to market losses related to trading activity. In addition, $90 million represented the reversal of mark to market losses, which ultimately settled as financial revenues. In 2005, the total derivative loss was $285 million comprised of $132 million in financial revenue losses and $153 million mark to market losses. Hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk of commodity price movements on revenues and cost of energy sold. The changes in such results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather taken together with the effects of pricing and cost changes on energy revenues and cost of energy. Thus, while the 2006 decrease in electricity prices adversely impacted the regions generation portfolio compared to the prior year, it was also favorably impacted by positive mark to market gains on the regions forward sales and the settlement of positions as smaller losses as compared with the prior year. Cost of Energy Cost of energy was $615 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. This was a decrease of $254 million compared to the same period in 2005. The decrease was primarily attributable to an 18% decline in generation from the regions generation assets. Oil fuel costs in the Northeast region decreased by $143 million, as the decline in oil fired generation accounted for 66% of the total decline in generation volume. Gas fuel costs for the Northeast region decreased by $101 million. Coal costs increased by $11 million, despite slightly lower generation, primarily due to higher rail transportation costs. Emission allowance amortization costs declined in 2006 by $18 million, primarily due to lower generation, which resulted in lower consumption of emission allowances. 88 Table of Contents Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the Northeast region were $378 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of $15 million compared to the same period in 2005. Maintenance expense increased by $15 million in 2006 primarily due to more extensive boiler tube work at the regions Dunkirk and Arthur Kill plants to reduced forced outage hours and additional turbine maintenance and oil tank repair costs at the regions Oswego facility. Offsetting higher maintenance cost, was a decrease in plant utilities by $20 million. This was primarily due to a favorable court decision in the second quarter 2006 that allowed the Northeast region to reverse into earnings $18 million of previously accrued station power expense. General and administrative costs decreased by $10 million in 2006, primarily due to increased personnel and external consulting costs incurred to advance the regions Repowering NRG program. During 2006, the Northeast region incurred $8 million in expenditures to advance its regional redevelopment efforts. This increase was offset by $8 million in lower insurance costs and $14 million in lower corporate allocation. 2005 compared to 2004 The following table provides selected financial information for the Northeast region for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 1,444 $ 853 69 % Capacity revenue 291 265 10 Risk Management Activities (285 ) 58 NA Contract amortization (6 ) NA Other revenues 104 81 28 Total operating revenues 1,554 1,251 24 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 869 521 67 Depreciation and amortization 74 73 1 Other operating expenses 393 339 16 Operating Income $ 218 $ 318 (31 ) MWh sold (in thousands) 16,246 14,259 14 MWh generated (in thousands) 16,246 14,259 14 Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 91.98 $ 63.53 45 Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 801 516 55 CDDs 30 year rolling average 537 537 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 6,162 6,157 HDDs 30 year rolling average 6,261 6,294 (1 )% (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region.

The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. 89 Table of Contents Operating Income For the year ended December 31, 2005, operating income for the Northeast region was $218 million, compared to $318 million for the same period in 2004, a decrease of $100 million. This decrease was primarily due to $121 million net mark to market losses reported by the Northeast associated with forward sales of electricity, compared to a $59 million net mark to market gain recorded in 2004. Excluding mark to market losses, the Northeast regions operating income increased by $21 million. This increase was largely due to increased power prices, wider dark spread margins, and increased generation from the regions gas and oil fired assets. With higher than average temperatures in the summer of 2005, on peak electricity prices increased 43% to 52% compared to 2004, while gas and oil prices increased 50% and 49%. Spark spreads on the regions gas and coal margins widened, while oil margins were compressed compared to the same period in 2004. The Northeast regions New York City assets benefited from increased spark spreads and with increased generation output, by 53% compared to 2004, from 1.1 million MWh to 1.7 million MWh, due to increased summer demand. Generation from the Northeast regions oil fired assets increased by 120%, but oil margins decreased by 25% compared to 2004, as cost per MWh increased by 29% in comparison to the same period in 2004, due to an offsetting increase in oil prices. Total Operating Revenues Total operating revenues from the Northeast region totaled $1,554 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $1,251 million for the same period in 2004, an increase of $303 million. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included $1,444 million in energy revenues compared to $853 million for the same period in 2004. Of this $591 million increase, $183 million can be attributed to the regions New York City assets. Due to outages of local competitors and extreme summer heat, generation from the regions New York City assets increased by 53% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Excluding $23 million of final NYISO settlement payments, increased generation accounted for 49% of the increase in New York City energy revenues. The regions oil fired assets earned $211 million more in energy revenues due to increased generation by 120% during 2005 compared to 2004; 86% of the increase in energy revenues was due to increased generation. The regions coal assets recorded higher energy revenues of $99 million, primarily due to higher power prices as generation from the regions coal assets had a minimal decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005. Capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $291 million, compared to $265 million for the same period in 2004. Capacity revenues were favorable compared to the previous year due to $24 million of additional capacity revenues recorded during the second quarter of 2005 in connection with the regions Connecticut RMR settlement agreement approved by FERC on January 22, 2005. These settlement revenues were offset, however, by lower capacity revenues from the regions western New York plants. Capacity prices in western New York were negatively impacted by the addition of new capacity supply and increased imports into the state. Other revenues which include emission allowance sales, natural gas sales and expense recovery revenues, totaled $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $81 million for the year ended 2004, an increase of $23 million. This increase was related to $43 million in emission allowance sales and $6 million in higher gas sales. These increases were partially offset by $29 million in lower expense recovery revenues related to the Connecticut RMR agreement. The region reached its maximum payment under that agreement during the first quarter of 2005. Risk Management Activity The total derivative loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 was approximately $285 million, comprised of $132 million in financial revenue losses and $153 million of mark to market losses. The $132 million loss in financial revenues represented the settled value for the year of financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Of the $153 million of mark to market losses, $121 million represented the change in fair value of forward sales of electricity and fuel, $59 million represented the reversal of mark to market gains, which ultimately settled as financial revenues, and $27 million in gains were associated with trading activities. Since hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk of commodity price movements on revenues and cost of energy sold, the changes in such results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather taken together with the effects of pricing and cost changes on energy revenues and costs of energy. In the fourth quarter of 2004 and over the 90 Table of Contents course of 2005, NRG hedged much of its calendar year 2005 and 2006 Northeast regions generation. Since that time and during the third quarter 2005 in particular, the settled and forward prices of electricity rose, driven by the extreme weather conditions this summer. While this increase in electricity prices benefited the regions generation portfolio compared to the prior year with higher energy revenues, it was also the reason for the mark to market recognition of the forward sales and the settlement of positions as losses. Cost of Energy Cost of energy increased by $348 million for the Northeast region for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $869 million, compared to the same period in 2004. Oil fuel costs in the region increased by $162 million, where 65% of the increase was due to increased generation with the regions gas fuel costs increasing by $129 million. Higher gas sales from the regions New York City assets drove $15 million of the increase, with $109 million of the increase related to higher prices and demand for the regions New York City assets. Coal costs increased by $61 million, due to increased prices, although the regions coal fired generation had a minimal decrease during 2005 compared to 2004, specifically due to scheduled and unplanned outages at the regions western New York and Indian River facilities during the second and fourth quarters 2005. Of the $61 million increase in coal cost, 71% was due to increases at the regions Indian River plant. The regions Indian River plant used a higher portion of eastern coal, whose price experienced a significant increase during 2005. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the Northeast region increased by $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. This increase was driven by operating and maintenance costs, led by higher major maintenance costs. The low sulfur conversion projects continued at the regions western New York plants and began at its Indian River plant this year, and major outages related to turbine overhauls also took place at the regions western New York and Indian River plants. The increased number and scope of the outages contributed to the $14 million increase in major maintenance expense this year. Additionally, in 2004, a settlement with a third party vendor regarding auxiliary power charges reduced 2004 operating and maintenance expenses by $7 million. Other operating expenses for the Northeast region included administrative regional office costs, other non income tax expense, insurance and corporate allocations. These costs increased by $30 million in 2005 compared to 2004, $14 million of which was due to non income tax expense, as the region recognized property tax credits in 2004. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to regional office and corporate allocations. 91 Table of Contents South Central Region 2006 compared to 2005 The following table provides selected financial information for the South Central region for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 334 $ 339 (1 )% Capacity revenue 199 190 5 Risk Management Activities 13 (2 ) N/A Contract Amortization 19 9 111 Other revenues 5 24 (79 ) Total operating revenues 570 560 2 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 308 374 18 Depreciation and amortization 68 67 1 Other operating expenses 89 111 (20 ) Operating Income $ 105 $ 8 N/A MWh sold (in thousands) 11,845 11,771 1 MWh generated (in thousands) 11,036 10,009 10 Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 56.29 $ 69.96 (20 ) Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 2,908 2,826 3 CDDs 30 year rolling average 2,449 2,449 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 1,815 2,016 (10 )% HDDs 30 year rolling average 2,287 2,287 (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. An HDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. Operating Income The South Central region realized operating income of $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to operating income of $8 million for the same period in 2005, an increase of $97 million. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by better plant availability due to lower planned and forced outages in 2006, which resulted in 11% higher coal generation in 2006 than 2005. The Big Cajun II facility achieved an EFOR of 3.13% in 2006 compared to 6.56% in 2005, resulting in 907 fewer forced outage hours in 2006. In addition, the Big Cajun II coal units experienced 826 less planned outage hours in 2006 than in 2005. The forced outages in 2005 occurred primarily during the peak summer months when contract load is highest, requiring increased energy purchases than in 2006. These fewer planned outages in 2006 also resulted in $12 million of lower major maintenance expense, which benefited operating income. Favorable price spreads in 2006 allowed for resale of power received from the regions tolling agreements, providing additional margins. 92 Table of Contents Total Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased by $10 million in 2006 compared to 2005. Increased sales to the regions contract customers were offset by lower sales in the merchant market. Capacity revenues were $9 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2006 than in the same period for 2005, as the peak of 2011 MW set by the regions cooperative customers in August 2006 impacted capacity revenue in the latter half of 2006. The South Central region also recognized $13 million from risk management activities in 2006. Contract amortization increased by $10 million due to increased megawatt hour sales to contract customers and the expiration of the Rockford contract in 2005. Other revenues declined by $19 million from 2005 levels, primarily due to $23 million in lower gas sales relating to the regions tolling agreements. Cost of Energy Cost of energy for the South Central region was $308 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $374 million for the same period in 2005, a decrease of $66 million. Coal costs for the region increased by $25 million, reflecting contractual increases in coal commodity costs and higher plant availability in 2006. As a result of improved plant availability, energy purchased by the South Central region to support load contracts dropped 16%. The cost of purchased power, including the costs of the regions tolling agreements, was $74 million in 2006, a decrease of $71 million from 2005. This decrease was primarily due to fewer forced outages at the regions baseload coal plants in 2006 and the impact of netting energy purchases and resale. A drop in average purchased power prices by $9/MWh from 2005 to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in purchased power costs. The South Central region increased its use of generation from tolled facilities in 2006; tolled combined cycle plants contributed 1,451,758 MWh to the regions energy resources in 2006 compared to 474,386 MWh in 2005. The tolling agreements further contributed to the regions results as the spread between gas costs and energy costs widened in the summer of 2006. Transmission costs increased by $7 million due to a combination of contractual increases in network transmission rates and higher peaks in 2006. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the South Central region for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $89 million, a reduction of $22 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The reduction was primarily due to lower major maintenance costs, which dropped by $12 million due to fewer planned outages at the regions coal plant in 2006 and lower insurance costs, which were $3 million less in 2006 due to lower premiums. 93 Table of Contents 2005 compared to 2004 The following table provides selected financial information for the South Central region for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 339 $ 221 53 % Capacity revenue 190 211 (10 ) Risk Management Activities (2 ) N/A Contract Amortization 9 N/A Other revenues 24 2 N/A Total operating revenues 560 434 29 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 374 224 67 Depreciation and amortization 67 69 (3 ) Other operating expenses 111 80 39 Operating Income $ 8 $ 61 (87 ) MWh sold (in thousands) 11,771 10,613 11 MWh generated (in thousands) 10,009 10,361 (3 ) Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 69.96 $ 45.76 53 Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 2,826 2,550 11 CDDs 30 year rolling average 2,449 2,449 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 2,016 2,043 (1 )% HDDs 30 year rolling average 2,287 2,287 (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region.

The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. Operating Income For the year ended December 31, 2005, the South Central region realized operating income of $8 million, compared to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. During 2005, the regions Big Cajun II facility experienced several forced outages during the summer months, at which time contract demand and replacement power costs were at their highest. Generation for 2005 decreased by 3% from 10.3 million MWh to 10 million MWh compared to the same period in 2004, with 0.2 million MWh lost due to forced outages. These outages contributed to the purchase of $114 million in additional purchased energy required to meet contract load following obligations in the merchant market at costs higher than the regions coal based generation assets. In addition, during 2005, South Central had three planned outages compared to one major planned outage during 2004, which increased major maintenance by $20 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Total Operating Revenues Total operating revenues from the South Central region were $560 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $434 million for the same period in 2004, an increase of $126 million. Revenues for the year 94 Table of Contents ended December 31, 2005 included $339 million in energy revenues, of which 61% was contracted. This compares to $221 million of energy revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, 73% of which was contracted. The increase of $118 million in energy revenues and the lower percentage contracted was due to increased merchant energy sales following higher power prices, favorable weather, and nuclear plant outages in the region. Also, a round the clock 100 MW sale to Entergy and a tolling agreement, which at times provided power that could be resold at a higher price, helped to increase merchant revenues. Other revenues primarily include physical gas sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, other revenues totaled $24 million compared to $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, with the increase due to $23 million in physical gas sales related to a new gas sale agreement entered into in July 2005. NRG entered into this agreement in conjunction with power purchase agreements to minimize the South Central regions market purchases during peak months. Cost of Energy The South Central regions cost of energy increased by $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004. Of this amount, $114 million was due to higher purchased energy costs. During 2005, the regions Big Cajun II facility experienced a number of forced outages, encountered high demand from the regions long term contracts, and entered into 100 MW around the clock sale to Entergy, and a tolling agreement, all of which required the purchase of energy to meet contract load obligations. Purchased energy per MWh increased by 365% versus the same period in 2004. In addition, due to the extreme weather conditions and increased gas prices, the average purchased energy price increased $19 per MWh for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased by $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004, with $20 million of the increase primarily related to major maintenance due to increased planned and unplanned outages at the regions Big Cajun II facility, and $12 million related to the regional office expenses and corporate allocations. 95 Table of Contents West Region The following table provides selected financial information for the West region for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 75 $ 1 $ 10 Capacity revenue 68 (4 ) Risk Management Activities (3 ) Contract Amortization (3 ) Other revenues 6 3 4 Total operating revenues 146 4 7 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 80 1 5 Depreciation and amortization 3 1 1 Other operating expenses 55 8 9 Operating Income/(loss) $ 8 $ (6 ) $ (8 ) MWh sold (in thousands) 1,901 6 77 MWh generated (in thousands) 1,901 6 77 Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 60.12 $ 71.06 $ 53.16 Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 926 775 887 CDDs 30 year rolling average 704 704 704 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 3,001 2,842 2,826 HDDs 30 year rolling average 3,228 3,228 3,243 (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. An HDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. Operating Income For the year ended December 31, 2006, operating income for the West region was approximately $8 million, compared to a loss of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the West region recorded an operating loss of $8 million primarily due to higher cost of energy and other operating expenses. The 2006 gain in operating income was primarily due to NRGs acquisition of Dynegys 50% interest of WCP. The California high voltage power grid handled an all time record peak demand on July 24, 2006 at 50,270 MW, with the previous record peak demand of 45,431 MW set on July 20, 2005. Total Operating Revenues Total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $146 million, comprised of $75 million in energy revenues, of which 39% were contracted, and $68 million in capacity revenues. This compares to $4 million in operating revenues, comprised of $1 million in energy revenues and $3 million in other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2004, total operating revenues for the West region was $7 million, primarily comprised of energy revenues. 96 Table of Contents Cost of Energy Cost of energy for the year ended December 31, 2006, was approximately $80 million, consisting primarily of gas costs. For the year ended December 31, 2005, cost of energy for the West region was $1 million and $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Other Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the West region for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $55 million, or 38% of the regions total operating revenues. These costs included $32 million in operating and maintenance costs, of which $10 million was related to normal maintenance expenses associated with outage work. The region also incurred approximately $19 million in G&A expenses, of which $4 million was related to development costs associated with the Companys Repowering NRG program and approximately $3 million in corporate allocations. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of WCP, development spending, and NRG cost allocations. This compares to $8 million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Significant Events during 2006 Acquisitions and Dispositions The acquisition of Texas Genco LLC for $6.2 billion, including the assumption of approximately $2.7 billion in debt. Proceeds of approximately $357 million and an after tax gain of approximately $75 million recognized from the sale of Flinders and Audrain. Proceeds of approximately $109 million from the sale of non core assets. The purchase of the remaining 50% interest in WCP and sale of NRGs 50% interest in Rocky Road for a net $160 million. Financings and Operations The issuance of $5.6 billion in a senior credit facility, including a $1 billion revolving credit facility and a $1 billion synthetic letter of credit facility; $3.6 billion in unsecured high yield notes; $500 million of 5.75% Preferred Stock; and $1 billion of common stock related to the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. The extinguishment of $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of NRGs 8% second priority notes. The extinguishment of $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of Texas Genco LLC and Texas Genco Financing Corp.s 6.875% senior notes. The issuance of $1.1 billion in unsecured high yield notes and an increase by $500 million in the existing synthetic letter of credit facility related to the Hedge Reset transaction in November 2006. The institution of a Capital Allocation Program announced on August 1, 2006. Phase I consisted of the issuance of approximately $249 million of notes and $84 million of preferred interest by unrestricted subsidiaries to partially fund the purchase of $500 million of NRG common stock completed in the fourth quarter 2006. Phase II, also a $500 million share buyback, is expected to be completed in the first half of 2007, of which 4.2 million shares of NRG common stock had been repurchased as of December 31, 2006. Completed the repayment of $400 million in debt as part of Phase II. The termination of NRG term loan, funded letter of credit and revolving credit facilities issued on December 24, 2004. The return of cash collateral payments of $454 million due to decreases in forward prices for natural gas and power as well as the settlement of trades. 97 Table of Contents Liquidity Position As of December 31, 2006, NRGs liquidity was approximately $2.2 billion and included approximately $839 million of unrestricted and restricted cash. NRGs liquidity also included $855 million of borrowing capacity under the Companys revolving credit facility, and $533 million of availability under the Companys letter of credit facility. As of December 31, 2005, NRGs liquidity was $758 million and included $570 million of unrestricted and restricted cash. The Companys year end liquidity also included $150 million of available capacity under the Companys revolving line of credit and $38 million of availability under the Companys letter of credit facility. Credit Ratings Credit rating agencies rate the Companys public debt securities. These ratings are utilized by the debt markets in evaluating a firms credit risk. Ratings influence the price paid to issue new debt securities by indicating to the market NRGs ability to pay principal, interest, and preferred dividends. Rating agencies evaluate a firms industry, cash flow, leverage, liquidity, and hedge profile, among other factors, in their credit analysis of a firms credit risk. The following table summarizes the credit ratings for NRG Energy, Inc., its term loan and its senior notes as of December 31, 2006: S&P Moodys Fitch NRG Energy, Inc. B+ Ba3 B 7.375% Senior Notes, due 2016, 2017 B B1 B+ Senior Notes 7.25% B B1 B+ Term Loan BB Ba1 BB In November 2006, in connection with the Companys Hedge Reset transaction, all three agencies reviewed NRGs ratings and took the following actions: Moodys reaffirmed their rating but modified NRGs outlook to negative, reflecting their view of the increased debt level at NRG associated with the program; Standard & Poors reaffirmed their rating with a stable outlook; and Fitch reaffirmed their rating with a stable outlook. SOURCES OF FUNDS The principal sources of liquidity for NRGs future operating and capital expenditures were derived from new financing arrangements, asset sales, existing cash on hand and cash flows from operations. Financing Arrangements Texas Genco LLC Acquisition Related Financing To finance the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, NRG received: (i) cash proceeds of approximately $1 billion upon the issuance and sale in a public offering of 20,855,057 shares of NRG common stock at a price of $48.75 per share; (ii) cash proceeds received upon the issuance and sale of $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2014 and $2.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016; (iii) cash proceeds received upon the issuance and sale in a public offering of 2 million shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock at a price of $250 per share; and (iv) funds borrowed under a senior secured credit facility consisting of a $3.575 billion term loan facility, a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $1.0 billion synthetic letter of credit facility. Hedge Reset Transaction Related Financing To finance NRGs Hedge Reset transactions, the Company received $1.1 billion upon the sale of 7.375% Senior Notes due 2017. In addition, NRG amended the Companys existing Senior Credit Facility, which resulted in an increase of the synthetic letter of credit facility by $500 million to $1.5 billion. The amendment revised certain terms within the existing credit agreement to provide greater financial flexibility to the Company, including increasing NRGs restricted payment basket, which effectively governs the Companys ability to return capital to shareholders. As part of the amendment of the Companys Senior Credit Facility, NRG inserted a provision that results in an increased level of mandatory first lien debt repayment 98 Table of Contents each year. Beginning in 2008, NRG must offer a portion of its excess cash flow, an amount that approximates the Companys free cash flow for the prior year, to its first lien lenders. The percentage of the excess cash flow offered to these lenders is dependent upon the Companys consolidated leverage ratio at the end of the preceding year. Of the amount offered, the first lien lenders must accept 50%, while the remaining 50% may either be accepted or rejected at the lenders option. Capital Allocation Program In connection with NRGs share repurchase program, the company issued notes and preferred interest in the aggregate amount of $249 million and $84 million, respectively, to Credit Suisse through two wholly owned unrestricted subsidiaries of NRG. Asset Sales Red Bluff and Chowchilla On January 3, 2007, NRG completed the sale of the Red Bluff and Chowchilla II power plants to an entity controlled by Wayzata Investment Partners LLC. These power plants, located in California, are fueled by natural gas with generating capacity of 45 MW and 50 MW, respectively. Resource Recovery On November 8, 2006, NRG completed the sale of the Companys Newport and Elk River Resource Recovery facilities, Becker Ash Disposal facility, as well as the Companys ownership interest in NRG Processing Solutions LLC, to Resource Recovery Technologies, LLC for total proceeds of approximately $22 million. Australia On August 30, 2006, NRG announced the completion of the sale of its 100% owned Flinders power station and related assets or Flinders, located near Port Augusta, Australia, to Babcock & Brown Power Pty, a subsidiary of Babcock & Brown, a global investment and advisory firm. Proceeds from the sale were approximately $242 million (AU$317 million). The sale resulted in the elimination of approximately $370 million (AU$485 million) of consolidated liabilities, including approximately $183 million (AU$240 million) of non recourse debt obligations and approximately $92 million (AU$121 million) in non current liabilities related to the obligations for the purchase of electricity and the supply of fuel to the Osborne power station that were guaranteed by NRG. NRG recognized an after tax gain of approximately $60 million from the sale. Rocky Road On March 31, 2006, in conjunction with NRGs purchase of Dynegys 50% interest in WCP, NRG sold the Companys 50% interest in Rocky Road to Dynegy as part of the Companys purchase and sale agreement with Dynegy for a sale price of $45 million. There was no gain or loss on the sale due to the fact that in 2005, NRG recorded an impairment charge of approximately $20 million to write down the value of NRGs 50% interest in Rocky Road to its fair value of $45 million. Audrain On March 29, 2006, NRG completed the sale of Audrain generating station, a gas fired peaking facility in Vandalia, Missouri, to AmerenUE, a subsidiary of Ameren Corporation. The proceeds from the sale were $115 million, plus AmerenUEs assumption of $240 million of non recourse capital lease obligations and assignment of a $240 million note receivable. NRG recorded a pre tax gain of $15 million. USES OF FUNDS The Companys requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (1) Acquisitions; (2) Commercial Operations activities; (3) capital expenditures; (4) corporate financial transactions such as share repurchases; and (5) debt service obligations. Acquisitions Texas Genco LLC On February 2, 2006, NRG acquired Texas Genco LLC, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement dated September 30, 2005. The purchase price of approximately $6.2 billion consisted of approximately $4.4 billion in cash, the issuance of approximately 35.4 million shares of NRGs common stock valued at approximately $1.7 billion and acquisition costs of approximately $0.1 billion. The value of NRGs common stock issued to the Sellers was based on the Companys average stock price immediately before and after the closing date of February 2, 2006. The acquisition also included the assumption of approximately $2.7 billion of Texas Genco LLC debt. In connection with the acquisition, NRG substantially revised its financial structure. 99 Table of Contents West Coast Power Holdings, Inc. On March 31, 2006, NRG completed purchase and sale agreements for projects co owned with Dynegy, Inc., or Dynegy. Under the agreements, NRG acquired Dynegys 50% ownership interest in WCP (Generation) Holdings, LLC, or WCP, for $205 million and NRG became the sole owner of WCPs 1,825 MW of generation capacity in Southern California. In addition, NRG sold to Dynegy its 50% ownership interest in Rocky Road Power LLC, or Rocky Road, a 330 MW gas fueled, simple cycle peaking plant located in Dundee, Illinois. NRG sold Rocky Road for a fair value sale price of $45 million, thus paying Dynegy a net purchase price of $160 million at closing. Commercial Operations Commercial Operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (1) margin and collateral posted with counter parties; (2) initial collateral required to establish trading relationships; (3) timing of disbursements and receipts (i.e., buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); and (4) initial collateral for large structured transactions. As of December 31, 2006, Commercial Operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $27 million, and $967 million outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its economic hedging activities. Future liquidity requirements may change based on the Companys hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on NRGs credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness. Collateral In connection with the Companys power generation business, NRG manages the commodity price risk associated with the Companys supply activities and electric generation facilities. This includes forward power sales, fuel and energy purchases and emission allowances. In order to manage these risks, NRG enters into financial instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of electricity and purchases of fuel and energy. NRG utilizes a variety of instruments, including forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps and options. Certain contract counterparties require NRG to post margin collateral. As of February 21, 2007, NRG had posted $81 million in collateral to support these contracts. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $221 million, $106 million and $119 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006, approximately half of the $221 million in capital spending was in NRG Texas. Expenditures of $63 million are attributed to South Texas Project, mainly for nuclear fuel purchases and a turbine replacement, which resulted in an increase in capacity. The balance of the Texas spending was for major projects at the fossil plants, including environmental and uprate projects at Limestone, another major uprate project at W.A. Parish, combustion system work at San Jacinto and T.H. Wharton, and work at Jewett mine. Northeast capital spending of $50 million was mostly due to additional work at Huntley and Dunkirk related to the plants coal handling facilities, including $18 million largely for PRB coal conversion and reheater replacements at Indian River. A reliability improvement project at Big Cajun II and a transmission expansion project account for the majority of South Central expenditures of $11 million. In 2005, capital expenditures were related to PRB coal conversions, and associated conveyor track and emissions compliance upgrades at the Companys western New York plants and Indian River facility. Capital expenditures in 2004 also related primarily to the conversion of NRG western New York plants to PRB coal. Environmental capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were approximately $11 million and $18 million, respectively. Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated that approximately $1.28 billion of environmental capital expenditures will be incurred during the period 2007 through 2012, primarily related to installation of particulate, SO2, NOx, and mercury controls to comply with the CAIR and Clean Air Mercury rules, as well as installation of BTA under the Phase II 316(b) Rule. NRG currently updates its estimates for environmental capital expenditures annually, and these estimates can be expected to change over time, in some cases materially. These plans are based on current regulatory requirements and best engineering practices. Changes to regulations or market conditions could result in changes to installed equipment timing or associated costs. 100 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the estimated environmental capital expenditures for the referenced period, by region and by year: South Texas Northeast Central Other Total (In millions) 2007 $ 9 $ 118 $ 41 $ 9 $ 177 2008 16 183 93 10 302 2009 19 183 167 5 374 2010 26 144 84 4 258 2011 19 30 63 1 113 2012 13 3 33 49 Total $ 102 $ 661 $ 481 $ 29 $ 1,273 NRG is working to reduce a portion of the above environmental capital expenditures through the Companys ability to monetize a portion of its excess allowances over the 2007 2012 timeframe and still hold sufficient allowances to operate the fleet with proposed controls through at least 2020. In addition, NRGs current contracts with the Companys rural electrical customers in the South Central region allow for recovery of a significant portion of the costs incurred by complying with new laws along with a capital return, including interest over the asset life of the required expenditures. Actual recoveries will depend, among other things, on the duration of the contracts and the treatment of these expenditures. Corporate Financial Transactions Hedge Reset and Extension On November 21, 2006, NRG announced the completion of the Companys Hedge Reset transaction, which included (1) the net settlement of existing out of the money hedges for the years 2006 through 2011 to market, (2) substantial new baseload hedges for the years 2010 through 2012 and, possibly, later years, (3) the issuance of $1.1 billion of new high yield notes, and (4) amendments to NRGs existing Senior Credit Facility, including the increase of the synthetic letter of credit facility by $500 million. As part of the Hedge Reset transaction, NRG net settled certain existing hedge agreements for the years 2006 through 2010, including hedge agreements with J. Aron & Company. These hedges were gas swaps and power contracts that were acquired as part of the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, which closed on February 2, 2006. These contracts were entered into by Texas Genco LLC at a time when power and natural gas prices were lower than they were at the time of the Hedge Reset, and as a result, the previous hedges obligated NRG to sell power or natural gas at prices significantly below current market prices. Under the amended agreements, NRG negotiated the pricing of these hedges to reflect prevailing market prices, and paid cash to the hedge counterparties in amounts that reflect a negotiated present value of the difference between the original prices in the hedges and the amended prices. The total amount paid to the counterparties was approximately $1.35 billion. The Hedge Reset provided the Companys shareholders with a number of benefits. First, the Company has increased its cash flows that will be available to shareholders between 2007 and 2010 by approximately $1.5 billion. Second, it has afforded NRG the flexibility, through the Companys second lien structure, to expand the Companys hedges on baseload generation for the 2010 2012 periods, thus reducing the volatility in earnings and cash flow. Third, the Company obtained amendments of its Senior Credit Facility that has provided the Company the ability to return more capital to shareholders, as well as greater flexibility in the Companys Repowering NRG program. Capital Allocation Program During the third quarter 2006, NRG initiated a plan, known as the Capital Allocation Program, to repurchase approximately $750 million of its common stock. Phase I was a $500 million stock repurchase program, which was completed on October 13, 2006. To implement Phase I, the Company formed two wholly owned unrestricted subsidiaries to repurchase shares of NRGs common stock in the public markets or in privately negotiated transactions. These subsidiaries were funded with a combination of approximately $167 million in cash from NRG, together with the proceeds from the issuance of approximately $249 million in notes and approximately $84 million in preferred stock to Credit Suisse, 101 Table of Contents for a total amount of approximately $500 million. Both the notes and the preferred interests will mature in two tranches: $137 million in notes and $53 million in preferred interests will mature in October 2008, and $112 million in notes and $31 million in preferred interests will mature in October 2009. On October 13, 2006, NRG completed Phase I of the program, with total common stock repurchased of 10,587,700 common shares at an average price of $47.22 for approximately $500 million. On November 24, 2006, NRG, as part of Phase II of the Companys Capital Allocation Program, announced an agreement to repurchase 4,212,881 shares of NRG common stock from affiliates of the Blackstone Group at a price of $55.00 per share. The Blackstone Group received these shares as part of the consideration that NRG paid for the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. Following this repurchase, the four largest previous shareholders of Texas Genco LLC have concluded the sale of all of their NRG common stock received pursuant to the Acquisition. On December 29, 2006, NRG repaid $400 million of the Companys term loan facility, completing the debt reduction portion of the Companys Capital Allocation Program. NRG used cash on hand to fund the repayment. As of December 31, 2006 and February 28, 2007, there were approximately $268 million of shares to be repurchased in Phase II of the Companys Capital Allocation Program. We expect to complete Phase II during the first half of 2007. Acquisition Related Financing On January 31, 2006, NRG used proceeds from the issuance of common stock and cash on hand to repay the $446 million outstanding principal balance of the Companys senior secured term loan facility and terminated the facility. On February 2, 2006, NRG used proceeds from new debt financing related to the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC to pay accrued but unpaid fees on the Companys revolving credit facility and funded letter of credit facility, and terminated those facilities. Those facilities were replaced by a new term loan, letter of credit and revolving financing facilities as of February 2, 2006. NRGs previously outstanding 8% second priority notes of approximately $1.1 billion were extinguished by NRG on February 2, 2006, and previously outstanding Texas Genco notes of approximately $1.1 billion were purchased by NRG on February 3, 2006, with proceeds from the issuance of new unsecured high yield notes. Second Lien Structure NRG has granted second priority liens to certain counterparties on substantially all of the Companys assets in the United States in order to secure obligations, which are primarily long term in nature under certain power sale agreements and related contracts. NRG uses the second lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it may otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under these agreements. Within the second lien structure, the Company can hedge up to 80% of its baseload capacity and 10% of its non baseload assets with these counterparties. As of February 21, 2007, the net discounted exposure on the agreements and hedges that were subject to the second lien structure was approximately $182 million. The following table summarizes the amount of MWs hedged against the Companys baseload assets and as a percentage relative to the Companys forecasted baseload capacity under the second lien structure as of February 21, 2007: Equivalent Net Sales secured by Second Lien Structure(a) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 In MW 3,371 3,200 3,682 3,017 3,293 591 As a percentage of total forecasted baseload capacity 57 % 54 % 63 % 52 % 57 % 13 % (a) Equivalent Net Sales include natural gas swaps converted using a weighted average heat rate by region. Collateral In March 2004, NRG entered into two interest rate swap agreements, one of which matured on March 31, 2006. The remaining swap agreement matures in 2011. Depending on market interest rates, NRG or the swap counterparty may be required to post collateral on a daily basis in support of this swap, to the benefit of the other party. On December 31, 2006 and February 21, 2007, NRG had posted approximately $10 million in collateral. 102 Table of Contents Preferred Stock Dividend Payments For the year ended December 31, 2006, NRG paid approximately $9.1 million, $16.8 million and $25.0 million in dividend payments to holders of the Companys 5.75%, 4% and 3.625% Preferred Stock. Debt Service Obligations Project Finance Obligations NRG is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through subsidiaries. Consistent with NRGs strategy, it may seek, where available on commercially reasonable terms, project level debt in connection with the assets or businesses of its affiliates, including the Companys repowering program, or the Company may develop, construct or acquire new projects in partnership with others. Project level borrowings are substantially non recourse to other subsidiaries, affiliates and the Company, and are generally secured by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of the related project subsidiary or affiliate being financed. Some of these project financings may require the Company to post collateral in the form of cash or an acceptable letter of credit. As of December 31, 2006, NRG had approximately $4.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured high yield notes or Senior Notes and approximately $3.1 billion in principal amount outstanding under the term loan and had issued $967 million of letters of credit under the Companys $1.5 billion letter of credit facility, leaving $533 million available for future issuances. Under the Companys $1.0 billion revolving facility, as of December 31, 2006, NRG had issued $145 million in letters of credit, leaving $855 million available for borrowings, of which approximately $155 million could be used to issue additional letters of credit. As of February 21, 2007, $551 million of undrawn letters of credit remain available under the funded letter of credit facility, $141 million of undrawn letters of credit remain available under the revolving credit facility, and NRG had no borrowings on the Companys revolving credit facility. Principal payments on debt and capital leases as of December 31, 2006 are due in the following periods: Subsidiary/Description 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In millions) Debt: 7.375% Notes due 2017 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1,100 $ 1,100 7.25% Notes due 2014 1,200 1,200 7.375% Notes due 2016 2,400 2,400 Term Loan, due 2013 36 36 36 36 36 2,968 3,148 CSF Non Recourse Obligations 190 143 333 ML Note 11 11 NRG Energy Center Minneapolis, due 2013 and 2017 9 10 11 11 12 50 103 NRG Peaker Finance Co LLC 11 13 15 20 21 210 290 Camas Pwr BLR LP Bank facility 1 1 Camas Pwr BLR LP Bonds 2 2 ITISA, due January 2012 3 4 4 4 4 19 ITISA, due December 2013 4 4 4 4 4 12 32 Subtotal Debt, Bonds and Notes 66 257 213 75 77 7,951 8,639 Capital Lease: Saale Energie GmbH, Schkopau 68 30 23 11 5 62 199 Other 2 2 Total Payments and Capital Leases $ 136 $ 287 $ 236 $ 86 $ 82 $ 8,013 $ 8,840 103 Table of Contents Cash Flow Discussion NRG obtains cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of certain assets and the proceeds from the issuance of notes and preferred stock. NRG uses these funds to finance operations, make interest payments, repurchase its common stock, service debt obligations, finance capital expenditures, and meet other cash and liquidity needs. The following table reflects the changes in cash flows for the comparative years; all cash flow categories include the cash flows from both continuing operations and discontinued operations: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 408 $ 68 $ 340 Net cash provided/(used) by investing activities (4,176 ) 158 (4,334 ) Net cash provided/(used) by financing activities 4,053 (830 ) 4,883 Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $340 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. This was primarily due to the following reasons: Due to expiration of the underlying contracts and the downward shift of the forward price curves, NRGs cash collateral deposits in support of derivative contracts decreased by $454 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to an increase of $405 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a difference of $859 million. As of December 31, 2006, NRG had cash collateral deposits of $27 million; Due to the redemption of NRGs previous senior notes, a premium of $126 million was paid to NRGs former debt holders; NRGs activity for the year ended December 31, 2006 resulted in an increase of $197 million in working capital compared to a decrease in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2005 of $7 million, a difference of $204 million; Due to redemption of NRGs 8% second priority notes, for the year ended December 31, 2006, NRG wrote off $61 million of deferred financing costs less debt premium of $14 million for a net write off of $47 million, compared to a write off of debt premiums of $8 million during the same period in 2005, a difference of $55 million; and A gain on the sale of emission allowances adjusted net income by $64 million to reflect the activity as investing. Due to price conditions, it was economically beneficial to sell emissions rather than operate certain plants. Net Cash Provided/(Used) By Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in investing activities was approximately $4.3 billion more than for the year ended December 31, 2005. NRGs use of cash was due to the following mix of investment activities: During the first quarter 2006, NRG acquired Texas Genco LLC for approximately $6.2 billion (net of assumed debt), which included the issuance of stock at a value of $1.7 billion and a net cash payment of approximately $4.3 billion (net of cash on hand at Texas region of $238 million); NRG acquired Dynegys 50% ownership interest in WCP for $25 million (net of cash on hand at WCP of $180 million). Prior to the purchase, NRG had an existing investment in WCP accounted for as an unconsolidated equity method investment; During 2006, NRG divested a number of the Companys equity investments for total proceeds of approximately $86 million; in addition, NRG received approximately $260 million in proceeds from sale of assets classified as discontinued operations; and 104 Table of Contents NRGs capital expenditures were $115 million more for the year ended December 31, 2006 than for the year ended December 31, 2005, with the increase primarily related to capital expenditures at Texas and the Northeast regions. Net Cash Provided/(Used) in Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by financing activities increased by approximately $4.9 billion, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to the financing activities related to the purchase of Texas Genco LLC: In conjunction with the purchase of Texas Genco LLC, NRG refinanced the Companys outstanding debt as well as Texas Genco LLCs outstanding debt as NRG: Repaid $446 million in outstanding principal and terminated its term loan under NRGs Amended Credit Facility; Repurchased and retired approximately $1.1 billion of NRGs 8% Second Priority Notes, pursuant to a tender offer; and Repurchased Texas Genco LLC outstanding notes for approximately $1.1 billion and Texas Genco LLC term loan for approximately $500 million. As part of raising the funds to purchase Texas Genco LLC and to refinance the NRG debt portfolio, the Company: Issued 20,855,057 shares of common stock on January 31, 2006 at an offering price of $48.75 per share for total net proceeds of approximately $986 million, after deducting expenses; Issued 2,000,000 shares of 5.75% Preferred Stock on January 30, 2006 at an offering price of $250 per share for total net proceeds of approximately $486 million, after deducting expenses; Entered into a new senior secured credit facility providing for an aggregate amount up to $5.575 billion, consisting of a $3.575 billion Term Loan Facility, a $1.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility, and a $1.0 billion Letter of Credit Facility; and Issued (i) $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes, and (ii) $2.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.375% Senior Notes. In accordance with FAS 133, as amended, payments of $296 million for the settlement of derivatives that were acquired with the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC are considered financing activities. These amounts are recorded as a reduction to revenues in the statement of operations. In connection with NRGs Hedge Reset transactions during the fourth quarter 2006, the Company issued approximately $1.1 billion 7.375% Senior Notes, due 2017, which were used to make cash payments to hedge counterparties of approximately $1.35 billion. During Phase I of the Companys Capital Allocation Program, NRG through two wholly owned unrestricted subsidiaries issued approximately $249 million in notes and $84 million in preferred interests to partially fund the purchase of approximately $500 million of NRGs common stock for the year ended December 31, 2006. Phase II of the Companys Capital Allocation Program has resulted in the repurchase of an additional $232 million of the Companys common stock with cash on hand as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the company repaid $400 million in debt. NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and FIN 48 Implications As of December 31, 2006, NRG had U.S. domestic net operating loss carryforwards of $72 million, which will expire in 2026. NRG believes that it is more likely than not that a benefit will not be realized on the deferred tax assets relating to capital loss carryforwards. This assessment included consideration of positive and negative factors, including NRGs current financial position, projected future earnings and capital gains, and available tax planning strategies. 105 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006, a valuation allowance totaling $581 million was recorded against deferred tax assets relating to U.S. domestic capital loss carryforwards and foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance was reduced from $836 million to $581 million due to earnings generated during 2006 by business operations as well as to the acquisition of the Texas region, which resulted in an overall reduction in the Companys valuation allowance. The Company has completed its initial evaluation of the impact of the January 1, 2007, adoption of FIN 48 and determined that such adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Discussion of Known Trends Repowering NRG Program NRG has announced a comprehensive portfolio redevelopment program, referred to as Repowering NRG, which involves the development, financing, construction and operation of new multi fuel, multi technology generation capacity at NRGs existing domestic sites to meet the growing demand in the Companys core markets. Through the Repowering NRG program, the Company anticipates retiring certain existing units and adding up to approximately 10,350 MW of new generation, with an emphasis on new baseload capacity that is supported by long term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, and financed with limited or non recourse project financing. NRG expects that these repowering investments will provide one or more of the following benefits: improved heat rates; lower delivered costs; expanded electricity production capability; an improved ability to dispatch economically across the merit order; increased technological and fuel diversity; and reduced environmental impacts. The Company expects that the Repowering NRG program will also result in indirect benefits, including the continuation of operations and retention of key personnel at its existing facilities. A critical aspect of the Repowering NRG program is the extent to which the Company seeks to reduce the carbon intensity of the Companys generation fleet by developing generating facilities with zero CO2 and low CO2 emissions, as well as facilities that can be equipped for CO2 separation and sequestration. As a result, the Repowering NRG program is important not only to NRG but also to the power industry in general. The American power industry is the primary emitter of CO2 in the largest CO2 emitting market on earth. As the power industry takes steps to develop the next wave of power generation infrastructure, technology and capital allocation decisions will be made which could impact GHG from power generation by either making the situation significantly worse or significantly better in terms of CO2 intensity. Although there is no current technological solution to retro fit existing fossil fueled technology to capture GHG from power plant flues, there are commercially available large scale technologies for new plants that can generate power with much lower GHG emissions than traditional coal fired generation. Given that new generation units have useful lives of up to 50 years, NRG will give full consideration to CO2 and other emissions that contribute to GHG when making its long term investment decisions. As part of the Repowering NRG program, NRG is pursuing a five pronged GHG emissions strategy as follows: 1. Nuclear development a known, reliable source of electricity with zero emissions. 2. IGCC development coal fueled baseload generation designed to reduce the intensity of CO2 emissions. 3. Wind development renewable energy for the future with zero emissions. 4. Public outreach NRG will work with government, industry and public interest groups to formulate and implement an economically and environmentally responsible GHG policy. 5. Bridge the technology gap The Company has launched a number of initiatives to improve technology through R&D particularly post combustion carbon capture, developing underground sequestration, and finding offsets that will mitigate CO2 production. NRG estimates that the Repowering NRG program, if fully implemented as currently proposed, could have a total capital cost of approximately $16 billion. While NRG believes it is extremely unlikely that the program will be fully implemented as currently proposed, the Company nonetheless expects the overall capital expenditures in 106 Table of Contents connection with the program will be substantial. NRG expects to mitigate the capital cost of the program through equity partnerships and public private partnerships, as well as through development fees for certain projects. To mitigate the investment risks, NRG anticipates entering into long term PPAs and engineering, procurement and construction, or EPC, contracts. The Company currently expects its share of cash contributions for the projects included in the Repowering NRG program to range between $500 million and $2.0 billion over the next decade. However, the proposed increase in generation capacity and capital costs resulting from Repowering NRG could change as proposed projects are included or removed from the program due to a number of factors, including successfully obtaining required permits and long term PPAs, availability of financing on favorable terms, and achieving targeted project returns. The projects that have been identified as part of the Repowering NRG program are subject to change as NRG refines the program to take into account the success rate for completion of projects, changes in the targeted minimum return thresholds, and evolving market dynamics. The following table summarizes the current projects included in the Repowering NRG program by fuel type: Fuel type MW Gas 4,050 Nuclear 2,700 Coal Gasification, or IGCC 1,500 Solid Fuel 1,800 Wind 300 Total 10,350 Capital Allocation Program As of December 31, 2006, NRG had repurchased 14,800,581 shares of Common Stock, at a cost of approximately $732 million through the Companys Capital Allocation Program, which commenced during the third quarter 2006. The program as previously announced was in two phases. Phase I was a $500 million share buyback program with Phase II, originally announced as a $250 million share repurchase. During the fourth quarter 2006, NRG increased Phase II of the share repurchase to $500 million. On October 13, 2006, NRG completed Phase I of NRGs Capital Allocation Program with the repurchase of 10,587,700 of the Companys common stock for approximately $500 million. At maturity, should NRGs stock price exceed a compound annual growth rate of 20% beyond a volume weighted average share price determined at the time of repurchase, referred to as the Reference Price, NRG will pay to Credit Suisse the market value of NRGs stock price over the Reference Price in either cash or stock. This difference will be recorded as an increase to the cost of the treasury shares repurchased. On November 24, 2006, as part of Phase II of NRGs Capital Allocation Program, NRG repurchased 4,212,881 shares of NRG common stock from affiliates of the Blackstone Group at a price of $55.00 per share for a total of approximately $232 million. The Blackstone Group affiliates acquired the shares in a private placement as part of the consideration that NRG paid for the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. In addition, on December 29, 2006, NRG completed a $400 million debt repayment in connection with the Companys Capital Allocation Program. As of February 28, 2007, the Company had approximately $268 million of shares to be repurchased in Phase II of the Capital Allocation Program. We expect to complete Phase II during the first half of 2007. Resetting of Existing Hedges, or Hedge Reset In November 2006, NRG net settled certain existing hedge agreements for the years 2006 through 2010. These hedges were entered into by Texas Genco LLC at a time when power and natural gas prices were lower than they were at the time of the Hedge Reset, and as a result, the previous hedges obligated NRG to sell power or natural gas at prices significantly below prevailing market prices. Under the amended agreements, NRG reset the pricing of these hedges to reflect prevailing market prices, and paid cash to the hedge counterparties in amounts that reflect a 107 Table of Contents negotiated present value of the difference between the original prices in the hedges and the amended prices. The total amount paid to the counterparties was approximately $1.35 billion. The Hedge Reset provided the Companys shareholders with a number of benefits. First, the Company has increased its cash flows that will be available to shareholders between 2007 and 2010 by approximately $1.5 billion. Second, it has afforded NRG the flexibility, through the Companys second lien structure, to expand the Companys hedges on baseload generation for the 2010 2012 periods, thus reducing the volatility in earnings and cash flow. Third, the Company obtained amendments of its Senior Credit Facility, which has provided the Company the ability to return more capital to shareholders, as well as greater flexibility in the Companys Repowering NRG program. The following table summarizes The Texas regions percentage of hedged baseload capacity and the corresponding revenues as of February 2, 2006; The revenues expected from those hedges following the Hedge Reset; The increase in cash based revenues following the Hedge Reset; and The expected increase in net revenues following the Hedge Reset. 2007 2008 2009 2010 (In millions unless otherwise stated) Texas region Net Baseload Capacity (MW) 5,340 5,340 5,340 5,340 Texas region Baseload Sales (MW)(a) 4,267 4,157 3,449 1,395 Percentage Baseload Capacity Sold Forward(b) 80 % 78 % 65 % 26 % As of Acquisition: Weighted Average Forward Price ($ per MWh)(c)(d) $ 39 $ 41 $ 47 $ 51 Total Forward Hedged Revenues(c) 1,443 1,505 1,434 621 After Hedge Reset(d) Weighted Average Forward Price ($ per MWh)(c)(e) 56 54 57 55 Total Forward Hedged Revenues(c) 2,103 1,963 $ 1,707 $ 723 Increase in energy revenue 660 458 273 102 Decrease in contract amortization revenue (563 ) (361 ) (261 ) (75 ) Net impact to reported revenue $ 97 $ 97 $ 12 $ 27 (a) Includes amounts under fixed price power sales contracts and amounts financially hedged under natural gas swap contracts. The forward natural gas swap quantities are reflected in equivalent MWh and are derived by first dividing the quantity of MMBtu of natural gas hedged by the forward market heat rate as of December 30, 2005 to arrive at the equivalent MWh hedged which is then divided by 8,760 (total hours in a year) to arrive at MW hedged. (b) Percentage hedged is based on total MWh sold as power and gas converted using the method as described in (a) above divided by the net capacity. The net capacity excludes loss in generation from expected forced outages and in generation from forecasted market uncertainties. (c) Includes amounts under fixed price power sales contracts and financially hedged under natural gas contracts. (d) Of the Texas region Baseload Sales, 72% of 2007, 58% of 2008, 73% of 2009 and 67% of 2010, had their price negotiated per the Hedge Reset. (e) Includes power contract prices which are comprised of a fixed demand charge which is exclusive of a fixed energy charge. The forward price related to these contracts is the sum of both charges. Based on the table above, due to the Hedge Reset of the Texas regions hedges that were outstanding as of February 2, 2006, revenues during the period 2007 2010 will increase by approximately $233 million. Off Balance Sheet Instruments and Other Contractual Arrangements Obligations under Certain Guarantee Contracts NRG and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include financial and performance 108 Table of Contents guarantees, stand by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. See Note 25, Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of these guarantee arrangements. Retained or Contingent Interests NRG does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. Derivative Instrument Obligations On August 11, 2005, NRG issued the 3.625% Preferred Stock, which includes a conversion feature that is considered a derivative per FAS 133. Although it is considered a derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting, as it is excluded from the scope pursuant to paragraph 11(a) of SFA 133. Despite this exclusion, per the guidance of EITF Topic D 98, the conversion feature must be marked to market. Currently, the conversion feature is valued at $0, as our stock price is outside the conversion range. See Note 13, Capital Structure, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. Obligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity Variable interest in Equity investments As of December 31, 2006, NRG has not entered into any financing structure that is designed to be off balance sheet that would create liquidity, financing, or incremental market risk or credit risk to the Company. However, NRG has numerous investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy related entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. NRGs pro rata share of non recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $153 million and $174 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to NRG. In the normal course of business, the Company may be asked to loan funds to unconsolidated affiliates on both a long and short term basis. Such transactions are generally accounted for as accounts payable and receivable to/from affiliates and notes payable/receivable to/from affiliates and, if appropriate, bear market based interest rates. Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility and Revolver Facility Under NRGs Amended Senior Credit Facility NRG entered into on November 21, 2006, the Company has a $1.5 billion synthetic Letter of Credit Facility that is unfunded by NRG, and a $1 billion senior Revolving Credit Facility. The synthetic Letter of Credit Facility is secured by a $1.5 billion cash collateral deposit, held by Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as the Issuing Bank. Under the synthetic Letter of Credit Facility, NRG is allowed to issue letters of credit to support the Companys obligations under commodity hedging or power purchase arrangements. In addition, NRG can issue up to $300 million in unfunded letters of credit under the Companys Revolving Credit Facility for ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions that are permitted under the Senior Credit Facility. In addition, NRG is permitted to issue additional letters of credit up to $700 million under the Senior Credit Facility through another financial institution. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had issued $967 million in letters of credit under the Letter of Credit Facility. Of this amount, a portion was issued to support obligations under terminated NRG letter of credit facilities. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had issued $145 million in revolver letters of credit, a portion of which supports non commercial letter of credit obligations under letter of credit facilities terminated as of February 2, 2006. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NRG has a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to the Companys capital expenditure programs. With the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, the Companys contractual obligations have increased significantly from the prior year. In addition, the financing related to the acquisition, as well as the sale of non core assets during 2006, has also contributed to an increase in the Companys outstanding guarantees. 109 Table of Contents The following tables summarize NRGs contractual obligations and guarantees. For an additional discussion, see Item 15 Note 11, Debt and Capital Leases, and Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

See Item 15 Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of commitments and contingencies that also include contractual obligations and commercial commitments that occurred during 2006. Derivative Instruments NRG may enter into long term power sales contracts, fuel purchase contracts and other energy related financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices, to hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities and protect fuel inventories. In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the Companys variable rate and fixed rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements. NRGs trading activities include contracts entered into to profit from market price changes as opposed to hedging an exposure, and are subject to limits in accordance with the Companys risk management policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings. These trading activities are a complement to NRGs energy marketing portfolio. The tables below disclose the activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; identify changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2006, based on 110 Table of Contents whether fair values are determined by quoted market prices or more subjective means; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2006.

The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed. On an ongoing basis, NRG evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Companys estimates. Any effects on the Companys business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. NRGs significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Companys financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. 111 Table of Contents Accounting Policy Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application Derivative Financial Instruments Assumptions used in valuation techniques Assumptions used in forecasting generation Market maturity and economic conditions Contract interpretation Market conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commitments Regulatory and political environments and requirements Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets Ability of tax authority decisions to withstand legal challenges or appeals Anticipated future decisions of tax authorities Application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions Ability to utilize tax benefits through carrybacks to prior periods and carryforwards to future periods Impairment of Long Lived Assets Recoverability of investment through future operations Regulatory and political environments and requirements Estimated useful lives of assets Environmental obligations and operational limitations Estimates of future cash flows Estimates of fair value (fresh start) Judgment about triggering events Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Estimated useful lives for finite lived intangible assets Judgment about impairment triggering events Estimates of reporting units fair value Fair value estimate of certain power sales and fuel contracts using forward pricing curves as of the closing date over the life of each contract Contingencies Estimated financial impact of event(s) Judgment about likelihood of event(s) occurring Derivative Financial Instruments The Company follows the guidance of SFAS 133, as amended, to account for derivative financial instruments. SFAS 133 requires the Company to mark to market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet, and recognize changes in the fair value of non hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. In certain cases, NRG may apply hedge accounting to the Companys derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure, (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives instruments accounted for as hedges are 112 Table of Contents either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item, or deferred and recorded as a component of OCI, and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur. For purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, NRG uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes. When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models to determine the fair value. These internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy based on the specific market in which the energy is being sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. In order to qualify derivatives instruments for hedged transactions, NRG estimates the forecasted generation occurring within a specified time period. Judgments related to the probability of forecasted generation occurring are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation, and historical physical delivery on similar contracts. The probability that hedged forecasted generation will occur by the end of a specified time period could change the results of operations by requiring amounts currently classified in OCI to be reclassified into earnings, creating increased variability in our earnings. These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates. Certain derivative financial instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered Normal Purchase and Normal Sales, or NPNS. The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that NRG has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation, and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment, and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings. Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets As of December 31, 2006, NRG had a valuation allowance of approximately $581 million related to the Companys U.S. domestic capital loss carryforwards of approximately $506 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $75 million. In assessing the recoverability of NRGs deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon projected capital gains and available tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2006, NRG had approximately $72 million of U.S. federal and state net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards for financial reporting purposes. The utilization of the Companys NOLs depends on several factors, such as NRGs ability to utilize tax benefits through carryforwards to future periods, the application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions. NRG continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions. Considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. A tax liability has been recorded for certain tax filing positions where the Company cannot sustain the tax return position at a should level of certainty. Such liabilities are based on managements judgment, which considers the best estimate of the amount and probable outcome of the tax position, and it can take several years between the time when a liability is recorded and when the related filing position is resolved with the taxing authority. Management periodically reviews these matters and adjusts the liabilities recorded on the financial statements as appropriate. Evaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other Than Temporary Decline in Value In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, or SFAS 144, NRG evaluates property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are: Significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset; Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition; 113 Table of Contents Adverse business climate; Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset, Current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and Change in the Companys intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs, and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Companys estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material. For assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value under SFAS 144, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held for sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. NRG considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence of such information, the Company may consider prices of similar assets, consult with brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. NRG will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability weights a range of possible outcomes. The use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in the Companys estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material. NRG is also required to evaluate its equity method and cost method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired. Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, or APB18, provides the accounting requirements for these investments. The standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under APB 18 is whether the value is considered an other than a temporary decline in value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under APB 18 involves the same uncertainties as described for long lived assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with SFAS 144. Similarly, the estimates that NRG makes with respect to its equity and cost method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which the Company hold these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of SFAS 144, NRG would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other than temporary decline in value under APB 18. For the year ended December 31, 2006, there was no reduction in income from continuing operation due to investment impairment. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, income from continuing operations was reduced by $6 million and $45 million, respectively, due to investment impairments. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets As part of the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, NRG recorded intangible assets and goodwill. The Company applied SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, or SFAS 141, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, or SFAS 142, to account for these intangibles. Under these standards, the Company amortizes all finite lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. However, goodwill and all intangible assets not subject to amortization will be tested for 114 Table of Contents impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates that an impairment may have occurred, or at a minimum, on an annual basis. Where necessary, the Companys goodwill and or intangible asset will be impaired at that time. In connection with the Texas Genco acquisition, the Company recognized the estimated fair value of certain power sale contracts and fuel contracts acquired. NRG estimated their fair value using forward pricing curves as of the closing date of the acquisition over the life of each contract. These contracts had negative fair values at the closing date of the acquisition and will be reflected as assumed contracts in the combined balance sheet. Assumed contracts are amortized to revenues and fuel expense as applicable based on the estimated realization of the fair value established on the closing date over the contractual lives. Contingencies NRG records a loss contingency when management determines it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Developments See Item 15 Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policy, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk NRG is exposed to several market risks in the Companys normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with the Companys merchant power generation or with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transaction. The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk and currency exchange risk. In order to manage these risks, the Company utilizes various fixed price forward purchase and sales contracts, futures and option contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps and options traded in the over the counter financial markets to: Manage and hedge fixed price purchase and sales commitments; Manage and hedge exposure to variable rate debt obligations; Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices; and Hedge fuel requirements for the Companys generating facilities. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices, volatility in commodities, and correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal and oil. A number of factors influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products. These factors include: Seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand; Extreme peak demands due to weather conditions; Available supply resources; Transportation availability and reliability within and between regions; and Changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations. As part of NRGs overall portfolio, NRG manages the commodity price risk of the Companys merchant generation operations by entering into various derivative or non derivative instruments to hedge the variability in 115 Table of Contents future cash flows from forecasted sales of electricity and purchases of fuel. These instruments include forward purchase and sale contracts, futures and option contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps and options traded in the over the counter financial markets. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon managements assessment of market, weather, operational, and other factors. While some of the contracts the Company uses to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources, other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices, contract quantities, or both. NRG uses the Companys best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts held and sold. These estimates consider various factors, including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit exposure. However, it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording mark to market derivative instrument valuation, and such variations could be material. NRG measures the sensitivity of the Companys portfolio to potential changes in market prices using Value at Risk, or VAR. VAR is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price volatility. Currently, the company estimates VAR using a Monte Carlo simulation based methodology. Prior to November 2006, NRG used a Variance/Covariance based VAR methodology. NRGs total portfolio includes mark to market and non mark to market energy assets and liabilities. NRG utilizes a diversified VAR model to calculate an estimate of the potential loss in the fair value of the Companys energy assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, load obligations, and bilateral physical and financial transactions. The key assumptions for the Companys diversified model include: (1) a lognormal distribution of price returns, (2) one day holding period, (3) a 95% confidence interval, (4) a rolling 24 month forward looking period, and (5) market implied price volatilities and historical price correlations. As of December 31, 2006, the VAR for NRGs commodity portfolio, including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions calculated using the diversified VAR model was $18 million. The following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VAR for NRG for the year ended December 31, 2006: VAR In millions As of December 31, 2006 $ 18 Average(a) 39 Maximum(a) 67 Minimum(a) 17 As of December 31, 2005 $ 37 Average 28 Maximum 46 Minimum 16 (a) Includes Texas region portfolio beginning the third quarter 2006. Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as VAR, the relative immaturity of the competitive markets for electricity and related derivatives, and the seasonality of changes in market prices, the VAR calculation may not capture the full extent of commodity price exposure. As a result, actual changes in the fair value of mark to market energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated VAR, and such changes could have a material impact on the Companys financial results. In order to provide additional information for comparative purposes to NRGs peers, the Company also utilizes VAR to estimate of the potential loss of financial derivative instruments that are subject to mark to market accounting. These derivative instruments include transactions that were entered into for both asset management and trading purposes. 116 Table of Contents The VAR for the financial derivative instruments calculated using the diversified VAR model as of December 31, 2006 for the entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset management and trading was approximately $32 million. Interest Rate Risk NRG is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through the Companys issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument. NRGs risk management policies allow the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations. In January 2006, the Company entered into a series of new interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps became effective on February 15, 2006, and are intended to hedge the risk associated with floating interest rates. For each of the interest rate swaps, NRG pays its counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest payment on a predetermined notional value, and NRG receives the equivalent of a floating interest payment based on a 3 month LIBOR rate calculated on the same notional value. All interest rate swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made quarterly, and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period. While the notional value of each of the swaps does not vary over time, the swaps are designed to mature sequentially. The total notional amount of these swaps as of December 31, 2006 was $2.15 billion. The notional amounts and maturities of each tranche of these swaps are as follows: Period of swap Notional Value Maturity 1 year $ 120 million March 31, 2007 2 year $ 140 million March 31, 2008 3 year $ 150 million March 31, 2009 4 year $ 190 million March 31, 2010 5 year $ 1.55 billion March 31, 2011 As of December 31, 2006, the Company had various interest rate swap agreements, including those listed above, with notional amounts totaling approximately $2.8 billion. If the swaps had been discontinued on December 31, 2006, the Company would have owed the counter parties approximately $10 million. Based on the investment grade rating of the counter parties, NRG believes its exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by counterparties to its hedge contracts to be insignificant. NRG has both long and short term debt instruments that subject the Company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2006, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a $15.1 million change in interest expense on a rolling twelve month basis. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value and the carrying amount of the Companys long term debt was $8.8 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Companys long term debt by $549 million. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of NRGs activities and in the management of the Companys assets and liabilities. NRGs liquidity management framework is intended to maximize liquidity access and minimize funding costs. Through active liquidity management, the Company seeks to preserve stable, reliable and cost effective sources of funding. This enables the Company to replace maturing obligations when due and fund assets at appropriate maturities and rates. To accomplish this task, management uses a variety of liquidity risk measures that take into consideration market conditions, prevailing interest rates, liquidity needs, and the desired maturity profile of liabilities. 117 Table of Contents Based on a sensitivity analysis, a $1 per MWh increase or decrease in electricity prices across the term of the marginable contracts would cause a change in margin collateral outstanding of approximately $40 million as of December 31, 2006. This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated based on portfolio composition and margin related contract provisions as of December 31, 2006. Credit Risk Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non performance or non payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages the credit risk of NRG and its subsidiaries through credit policies that include (i) an established credit approval process, (ii) a daily monitoring of counter party credit limits, (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, credit derivatives or prepayment arrangements, (iv) the use of payment netting agreements, and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. As of December 31, 2006, NRG held collateral support of approximately $681 million from counterparties. A portion of NRGs credit risk is related to transactions that are recorded in the Companys consolidated Balance Sheets. These transactions primarily consist of open positions from the Companys marketing and risk management operation that are accounted for using mark to market accounting, as well as amounts owed by counterparties for transactions that settled but have not yet been paid. The following table highlights the credit quality and their balance sheet settlement exposures related to these activities as of December 31, 2006: Exposure Before Credit Exposure Collateral Collateral Net Exposure (In millions, except ratios) Investment grade $ 1,812 $ 349 $ 1,463 Non investment grade 84 73 11 Not rated 146 3 143 Total $ 2,042 $ 425 $ 1,617 Investment grade 89 % 82 % 90 % Non investment grade 4 % 17 % 1 % Not rated 7 % 1 % 9 % Additionally, the Company has concentrations of suppliers and customers among coal suppliers, electric utilities, energy marketing and trading companies, and regional transmission operators. These concentrations of counterparties may impact NRGs overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory and other conditions. NRGs exposure to significant counterparties greater than 10% of the net exposure of approximately $1.6 billion was approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2006. NRG does not anticipate any material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any of NRGs counterparties. Currency Exchange Risk NRG is exposed to foreign currency risks associated with foreign denominated distributions from the Companys international investments. In the normal course of business, NRG may receive distributions denominated in the Euro, Australian Dollar and the Brazilian Real. Occasionally, NRG engages in a strategy of hedging foreign denominated cash flows for these related currency inflows, and to the extent required, fixes the U.S. Dollar equivalent of net foreign denominated distributions with currency forward and swaps agreements with highly credit worthy financial institutions. 118 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006, a 10% devaluation in the currency of all of the Companys exposure currencies would result in an immaterial impact to NRGs consolidated statements of operations. However, NRGs consolidated financial position would also have been negatively affected by approximately $60 million, due to currency translation adjustments recorded in OCI.
