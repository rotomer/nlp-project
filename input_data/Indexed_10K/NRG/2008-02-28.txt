Executive Summary Overview NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a wholesale power generation company with a significant presence in major competitive power markets in the United States. NRG is engaged in the ownership, development, construction and operation of power generation facilities, the transacting in and trading of fuel and transportation services, and the trading of energy, capacity and related products in the United States and select international markets. As of December 31, 2007, NRG had a total global portfolio of 191 active operating generation units at 49 power generation plants, with an aggregate generation capacity of approximately 24,115 MW and approximately 740 MW under construction which includes partnership interests. Within the United States, NRG has one of the largest and most diversified power generation portfolios in terms of geography, fuel type and dispatch levels, with approximately 22,880 MW of generation capacity in 175 active generating units at 43 plants. These power generation facilities are primarily located in Texas (approximately 10,805 MW), the Northeast (approximately 6,980 MW), South Central (approximately 2,850 MW), and West (approximately 2,130 MW) regions of the United States, with approximately 115 MW of additional generation capacity from the Companys thermal assets. NRGs principal domestic power plants consist of a mix of natural gas , coal , oil fired and nuclear facilities, representing approximately 46%, 33%, 16% and 5% of the Companys total domestic generation capacity, respectively. In addition, 15% of NRGs domestic generating facilities have dual or multiple fuel capacity, which allows plants to 69 Table of Contents dispatch with the lowest cost fuel option. NRGs domestic generation facilities consist of baseload, intermediate and peaking power generation facilities, the ranking of which is referred to as Merit Order, and include thermal energy production plants. The sale of capacity and power from baseload generation facilities accounts for the majority of the Companys revenues and provides a stable source of cash flow. In addition, NRGs generation portfolio provides the Company with opportunities to capture additional revenues by selling power during periods of peak demand, offering capacity or similar products to retail electric providers and others, and providing ancillary services to support system reliability. Business Strategy NRGs strategy is to optimize the value of the Companys generation assets while using its asset base as a platform for growth and enhanced financial performance which can be sustained and expanded upon in the years to come. NRG plans to maintain and enhance the Companys position as a leading wholesale power generation company in the United States in a cost effective and risk mitigating manner in order to serve the bulk power requirements of NRGs existing customer base and other entities that offer load or otherwise consume wholesale electricity products and services in bulk. NRGs strategy includes the following principles: Increase value from existing assets NRG has a highly diversified portfolio of power generation assets in terms of region, fuel type and dispatch levels. Through the FORNRG initiative, NRG will continue to focus on extracting value from its portfolio by improving plant performance, reducing costs and harnessing the Companys advantages of scale in the procurement of fuels and other commodities, parts and services, and in doing so improving the Companys return on invested capital, or ROIC. Reduce the volatility of the Companys cash flows through asset based commodity hedging activities NRG will continue to execute asset based risk management, hedging, marketing and trading strategies within well defined risk and liquidity guidelines in order to manage the value of the Companys physical and contractual assets. The Companys marketing and hedging philosophy is centered on generating stable returns from its portfolio of baseload power generation assets while preserving an ability to capitalize on strong spot market conditions and to capture the extrinsic value of the Companys intermediate and peaking facilities and portions of its baseload fleet. NRG believes that it can successfully execute this strategy by (i) leveraging its expertise in marketing power and ancillary services, (ii) its knowledge of markets, (iii) its balanced financial structure and (iv) its diverse portfolio of power generation assets. Pursue additional growth opportunities at existing sites NRG is favorably positioned to pursue growth opportunities through expansion of its existing generating capacity and development of new generating capacity at its existing facilities. NRG intends to invest in its existing assets through plant improvements, repowerings, brownfield development and site expansions to meet anticipated requirements for additional capacity in NRGs core markets. Through the RepoweringNRG initiative, NRG will continue to develop, construct and operate new and enhanced power generation facilities at its existing sites, with an emphasis on new baseload capacity that is supported by long term power sales agreements and financed with limited or non recourse project financing. NRG expects that these efforts will provide one or more of the following benefits: improved heat rates; lower delivered costs; expanded electricity production capability; an improved ability to dispatch economically across the Merit Order; increased technological and fuel diversity; and reduced environmental impacts, including facilities that either have near zero GHG, emissions or can be equipped to capture and sequester GHG emissions. Reduce carbon intensity of portfolio while taking advantage of carbon driven business opportunities NRG continues to actively pursue investments in new generating facilities and technologies that will be highly efficient and will employ no and low carbon technologies to limit CO2 emissions and other air emission. Through the RepoweringNRG and econrg initiatives, NRG is focused on the development of low or no GHG emitting energy generating sources, such as nuclear, wind, clean coal and gas, and the employment of post combustion capture technologies, which represents significant commercial opportunities. Maintain financial strength and flexibility NRG remains focused on cash flow and maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity, debt and equity in order to ensure continued access to capital for investment, to enhance risk adjusted returns and to provide flexibility in executing NRGs business strategy. NRG will continue to focus on maintaining operational and financial controls designed to ensure that the Companys financial position remains 70 Table of Contents strong. At the same time, the Companys ongoing capital allocation objective includes scheduled repayment of debt based on the amount of cash flow by the Company each year, as well as an annual return of capital to shareholders, targeted at an average rate of 3% of market capitalization, of approximately $250 million to $300 million per year. Pursue strategic acquisitions and divestures NRG will continue to pursue selective acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures to enhance its asset mix and competitive position in the Companys core markets. NRG intends to concentrate on opportunities that present attractive risk adjusted returns. NRG will also opportunistically pursue other strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions or divestitures. Business Environment General Industry Emerging trends impacting the power industry include (a) increased regulatory and political scrutiny, (b) financial credit market disruptions triggered by sub prime investment losses which may have, in part, contributed to current recessionary pressures, and (c) the development of power capacity markets intended to induce new investment in order to address tightening reserve margins. The industry dynamics and external influences that will affect the Company and the power generation industry in 2008 and for the medium term include: Carbon At the national level and at various regional and state levels, policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions, including CO2, the most common pollutant, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentive to reduce them. It is almost certain that GHG regulatory schemes will encompass power plants, with the impact on the Companys financial performance depending on a number of factors, including the overall level of GHG reductions required under any such regulation, the price and availability of offsets, and the extent to which NRG would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market. While the passing and timing of legislation remains uncertain, the Company expects that the impact of such legislation on the Companys financial performance, as such legislation is currently proposed, to have a minimal impact through the next decade. Thereafter, the impact would depend on the level of success of the Companys multifold strategy, which includes (a) shaping public policy with the objective being constructive and effective federal GHG regulatory policy, and (b) pursuing its RepoweringNRG and econrg programs. The Companys multifold strategy is discussed in greater detail in Item 1, Business under Carbon Update. Financial Credit Market Availability and Domestic Recessionary Pressures. Triggered largely by the decay in sub prime credit markets, the cost of credit has sharply increased while credit availability has declined. Capital intensive generators rely on the credit markets for liquidity and for the financing of power generation investments. Concurrently, economic indicators are pointing towards a potential slowdown in the United States economy. A sharp downturn in U.S. housing, the tighter credit conditions, and disappointing employment numbers, amongst other data have highlighted the risk of economic recession. Historically, an economic recession results in lower power demand and power prices. If an economic recession does occur in the near term it is unlikely to have a material impact on the Company due to the hedged position of its portfolio. Consolidation Over the long term, industry consolidation is expected to occur, with mergers and acquisitions activity in the power generation sector likely to involve utility merchant or merchant merchant combinations. There may also be interest by foreign power companies, particularly European utilities, in the American power generation sector. However, for the near term, and particularly in the coming year, given the current financial market environment along with the uncertainty surrounding domestic carbon legislation, consolidation is less likely. Infrastructure Development In response to record peak power demand, tightening reserve margins, and volatile natural gas prices, the power generation industry has announced significant expansion plans for both transmission and generation. In addition to traditional gas fired capacity, much of the new generation announced would be from non gas fuel sources, including nuclear and renewable sources. During 2007, 18 gigawatts of previously announced pulverized coal generation projects were canceled due to increasing public and political concern regarding carbon emissions. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created financial incentives for non traditional baseload generation, such as advance nuclear and clean coal technologies in order to reduce reliance on the more traditional pulverized coal technologies. Depending on the timing and location of this new construction, as well as 71 Table of Contents the construction activity in the oil and petrochemical sectors, access to experienced engineers, skilled operators, and maintenance workers could impact the timing and costs of these projects. Market Developments A number of the markets NRG serves are currently undergoing changes. NE ISO held its first auction in February 2008 for 2010 capacity commitments as part of its FCM, while in California, MRTU is scheduled to go into effect on April 1, 2008. PJM completed its first RPM auctions during 2007. The primary objective of these market re designs are to provide timely and accurate market signals to encourage new investment in transmission and new generation in the locations where the new investment is needed. In addition to these capacity market developments, in December 2008, ERCOT is expected to fully implement the Texas Nodal Protocols, which will revise the wholesale market design to incorporate locational marginal pricing, replacing the existing zonal wholesale market design. The ERCOT market design is expected to reduce local transmission congestion costs, with impacts on pricing uncertain at this time. Competition Wholesale power generation is a capital intensive, commodity driven business with numerous industry participants. NRG competes on the basis of the location of its plants and owning multiple plants in its regions, which increases the stability and reliability of its energy supply. Wholesale power generation is basically a local business that is currently highly fragmented relative to other commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies NRG competes against depending on the market. Weather Weather conditions in the different regions of the United States influence the financial results of NRGs businesses. Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Companys results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas and oil are higher in the winter. However, all regions of North America typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG is typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once. Other Factors A number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for NRGs business. These factors include: seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand; extreme peak demands; available supply resources; transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions; location of NRGs generating facilities relative to the location of its load serving opportunities; procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations. These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in: weather conditions; market liquidity; 72 Table of Contents capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems; local transportation systems; and the nature and extent of electricity deregulation. Stock Split On April 25, 2007, NRGs Board of Directors approved a two for one stock split of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock which was effected through a stock dividend. The stock split entitled each stockholder of record at the close of business on May 22, 2007 to receive one additional share for every outstanding share of common stock held. The additional shares resulting from the stock split were distributed by the Companys transfer agent on May 31, 2007. All share and per share amounts within this Form 10 K retroactively reflect the effect of the stock split. Environmental Matters, Regulatory Matters and Legal Proceedings NRG discusses details of its other environmental matters in Item 15 Note 23, Environmental Matters, to its Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1, Business Environmental Matters, section. NRG discusses details of its regulatory matters in Item 15 Note 22, Regulatory Matters, to its Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1, Business Environmental Matters, section. NRG discusses details of its legal proceedings in Item 15 Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, to its Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of this information is about costs that may be material to the Companys financial results. Impact of inflation on NRGs results Unless discussed specifically in the relevant segment, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the impact of inflation and changing prices (due to changes in exchange rates) on NRGs revenues and income from continuing operations was immaterial. Capital Allocation Strategy NRGs capital allocation philosophy includes reinvestment in its core facilities, maintenance of prudent debt levels and interest coverage, the regular return of capital to shareholders and investment in repowering opportunities. Each of these components are described further as follows: Reinvestment in existing assets Opportunities to invest in the existing business, including maintenance and environmental capital expenditures that improve operational performance, ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and expansion projects. Management of debt levels The Company uses several metrics to measure the efficiency of its capital structure and debt balances, including the Companys targeted net debt to total capital ratio range of 45% to 60% and certain cash flow and interest coverage ratios. The Company intends in the normal course of business to continue to manage its debt levels towards the lower end of the range and may, from time to time, pay down its debt balances for a variety of reasons. Return of capital to shareholders The Companys debt instruments include restrictions on the amount of capital that can be returned to shareholders. The Company has in the past returned capital to shareholders while maintaining compliance with existing debt agreements and indentures. The Company expects to regularly return capital to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases, while exploring other prospects to increase its flexibility under restrictive debt covenants. Repowering, econrg and new build opportunities The Company intends to pursue repowering initiatives that enhance and diversify its portfolio and provide a targeted economic return to the Company. 73 Table of Contents Significant events during the year ended December 31, 2007 Results of Operations Impact of Hedge Reset in November 2006, the Company reset legacy Texas hedges which resulted in an increase in energy revenue of $449 million as the periods average contract prices increased by approximately $13 per MWh as compared to the 2006 average contract prices. Development costs NRG incurred $101 million in net development costs primarily due to required engineering studies to obtain the Combined Construction and Operating License Application, or COLA, as well as development costs for other RepoweringNRG projects. On September 24, 2007, NRG filed a COLA with the NRC to build and operate two new nuclear units at the STP site. Effective October 29, 2007, the City of San Antonio agreed to partner with NRG in the development and ownership of these new units, to reimburse NRG for a pro rata share of certain project costs NRG had incurred, and to pay a pro rata share of future development costs. NRG was reimbursed $42 million for costs incurred to develop STP 3 and 4 through October 31, 2007; $39 million of the total $42 million was recorded as a reduction to development costs. Acquisition of Texas and WCP the inclusion of a full year of activity for the Texas region and WCP in 2007, contributed to an increase in operating income of approximately $76 million, compared to 2006. New capacity markets the introduction of the Locational Forward Reserve Market, or LFRM, the Reliability Pricing Model market, or RPM, and transition capacity payment markets, increased capacity revenues in the Northeast region by $78 million. Refinancing expense the Company recognized a $35 million write off of previously deferred financing cost due to the refinancing of the Companys Senior Credit Facility. Interest expense the increase in debt due to the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, Hedge Reset transaction and the Capital Allocation Program increased interest expense by approximately $99 million. Sale of ITISA on December 18, 2007, NRG entered into a sale and purchase agreement to sell its 100% interest in Tosli, which holds all of NRGs interest in ITISA, to Brookfield Asset Management Inc. for the purchase price of $288 million, plus the assumption of approximately $60 million in debt. NRG anticipates the completion of the sale transaction during the first half of 2008. As discussed in Note 3 Discontinued Operations, Business Acquisitions and Dispositions the activities of Tosli and ITISA have been classified in discontinued operations. Other STP Repowerings The NRC docketed the Companys COLA on November 30, 2007, signaling the beginning of their comprehensive and detailed review process. The Company expects to achieve commercial operation for Unit 3 approximately 48 months after issuance of the COLA, and commercial operation for Unit 4 approximately 12 months thereafter. Cedar Bayou Generating Station on August 1, 2007, NRG and a partner entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which the two parties will jointly develop, construct, operate and own, on a 50/50 undivided interest basis, a new 550 MW combined cycle natural gas turbine generating plant at NRGs Cedar Bayou Generating Station in Chambers County, Texas. In exchange for a 50% undivided interest in certain tangible and intangible assets and rights to use facilities owned by NRG, the partner agreed to pay NRG $45 million during a 24 month period. Long Beach on August 1, 2007, the Company successfully completed and commissioned the repowering of 260 MW of new gas fired generating capacity at its Long Beach Generating Station. This project is supported by a 10 year PPA. 74 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations 2007 compared to 2006 The following table provides selected financial information for NRG Energy, Inc., for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 4,265 $ 3,155 35 % Capacity revenue 1,196 1,516 (21 ) Risk management activities 4 124 N/A Contract amortization 242 628 (61 ) Thermal revenue 125 124 1 Hedge Reset (129 ) N/A Other revenues 157 167 (6 ) Total operating revenues 5,989 5,585 7 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of operations 3,378 3,265 3 Depreciation and amortization 658 590 12 General and administrative 309 276 12 Development costs 101 36 181 Total operating costs and expenses 4,446 4,167 7 Gain on sale of assets 17 N/A Operating Income 1,560 1,418 10 Other Income/(Expense) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 54 60 (10 ) Gains on sales of equity method investments 1 8 (88 ) Other income, net 55 156 (65 ) Refinancing expenses (35 ) (187 ) (81 ) Interest expense (689 ) (590 ) 17 Total other expenses (614 ) (553 ) 11 Income from Continuing Operations before income tax expense 946 865 9 Income tax expense 377 322 17 Income from Continuing Operations 569 543 5 Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense 17 78 (78 ) Net Income $ 586 $ 621 (6 ) Business Metrics Average natural gas price Henry Hub ($/MMbtu) 7.12 6.99 2 % N/A Not applicable 75 Table of Contents Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased by $404 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. This was due to: Energy revenues energy revenues increased by $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006: Texas energy revenues increased by $972 million of which $217 million was due to the inclusion of twelve months activity in 2007 compared to eleven months in 2006. Of the remaining $755 million increase, $449 million was due to the Hedge Reset transaction which resulted in higher 2007 average contracted prices of approximately $13 per MWh. In addition, revenues from 8.8 million MWh of generation moved from capacity revenue to energy revenue. Prior to the Acquisition, PUCT regulations required that Texas sell 15% of its capacity by auction at reduced rates. In March 2006, the PUCT accepted NRGs request to no longer participate in these auctions and that capacity is now being sold in the merchant market. These favorable results were partially offset by lower sales from the regions natural gas fired units due to a cooler summer which resulted in lower generation of approximately 2.7 million MWh. Northeast energy revenues increased by approximately $138 million, of which $61 million was due to a 6% increase in generation, primarily driven by increases at the regions Arthur Kill, Oswego and Indian River plants. The Arthur Kill plant increased generation by 448 thousand MWh due to transmission constraints around New York City, the Oswego plants generation increased by 127 thousand MWh due to a colder winter during 2007 compared to 2006, and the Indian River plants generation increased by 418 thousand MWh due to stronger pricing and fewer outages in the second half of 2007 compared to the second half of 2006. South Central energy revenues increased by approximately $70 million, due to a new contract which increased contract sales volume by approximately 1.3 million MWh and energy revenues by $69 million. Following a contractual fuel adjustment charge, energy revenues increased by $11 million from the regions cooperative customers. This was offset by a $12 million decrease in merchant energy revenue. West energy revenues decreased by approximately $72 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, due to the tolling agreement at the Encina plant that has resulted in the receipt of fixed monthly capacity payment in return for the right to schedule and dispatch from the plant. The Encina tolling agreement replaced an RMR agreement under which the plant was called upon to generate and earn energy revenues for such dispatch. Capacity revenues capacity revenues decreased by $320 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to a decrease in Texas capacity revenues that were partially offset by increases in capacity revenues in the Northeast, South Central and West regions: Texas capacity revenues decreased by $486 million due to a reduction of capacity auction sales mandated by the PUCT in prior years as previously discussed. Northeast capacity revenues increased by $81 million of which $39 million of the increase was from the regions NEPOOL assets and $36 million was from the regions PJM assets. The NEPOOL assets benefited from the new LFRM market and transition capacity market, both introduced in the fourth quarter 2006. Capacity revenues increased by $24 million from the LFRM market and $18 million from transition capacity payments, which was offset by a $3 million reduction in capacity payments due to the expiration of the Devon plants RMR agreement on December 31, 2006. On June 1, 2007, the new RPM capacity market became effective in PJM increasing capacity revenues by $36 million as compared to 2006. South Central capacity revenues increased by approximately $22 million. Of this increase, $15 million was due to higher billing rates as a result of the regions market setting new summer peaks hit in 2006 and 2007, $6 million was due to higher contractual transmission pass though costs to the regions cooperative customers and $3 million was due to improved market conditions at the regions Rockford plants. In 76 Table of Contents August 2007, the region set a new system peak of 2,123 MW which will continue to impact capacity revenue in the first half of 2008. West capacity revenues increased by approximately $54 million, of which $26 million was related to the inclusion of the first quarter 2007 compared to 2006. New tolling agreements at the regions Encina and Long Beach plants accounted for the remaining difference, with the Encina facility contributing approximately $15 million and the newly repowered Long Beach facility contributing approximately $13 million. Contract amortization revenues from contract amortization decreased by $386 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, as a result of the November 2006 Hedge Reset transaction, which resulted in a write off of a large portion of the Companys out of market power contracts during the fourth quarter 2006. Other revenues other revenues decreased by $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006 due to: Sale of emission allowances net sales of SO2 emission allowances decreased by approximately $33 million. In 2006, we sold emissions in lieu of generation due to an unseasonably warm first quarter. Since that time the average market price for SO2 allowances decreased by 28%. Physical gas sales decreased by $7 million due to the lower sales of excess natural gas. Ancillary revenues ancillary services revenue increased by approximately $27 million due to a change in strategy to actively provide ancillary services in the Texas region which increased revenues by $33 million. This was partially offset by a $4 million reduction in ancillary services in the Northeast region due to higher transmission costs following transmission constraints in the New York City area. Risk management activities gains/losses from risk management activities include all derivative activity that do not qualify for hedge accounting as well as the ineffective portion associated with hedged transactions. Such gains were $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The breakdown of changes by region are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 Texas Northeast South Central Total (In millions) Net gains on settled positions, or financial revenues $ 33 $ 43 $ 5 $ 81 Mark to market results Reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on settled positions related to economic hedges (83 ) (45 ) (128 ) Reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on settled positions related to trading activity (1 ) (12 ) (19 ) (32 ) Net unrealized gains on open positions related to economic hedges 19 15 34 Net unrealized gains/(losses) on open positions related to trading activity (1 ) 26 24 49 Subtotal mark to market results (66 ) (16 ) 5 (77 ) Total derivative gains/(losses) $ (33 ) $ 27 $ 10 $ 4 Risk management activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment resulted in a total derivative gain of approximately $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to a $124 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2006. NRGs 2007 derivative gain was comprised of $77 million mark to market losses and $81 million in settled gains, or financial revenue. Of the $77 million of mark to market losses, $128 million represents the reversal of mark to market gains previously recognized on economic hedges and $32 million from the reversal of mark to market gains previously recognized on trading activity. Both of these losses ultimately settled as financial revenues during 2007. The $34 million gain from economic hedge positions was comprised of a 77 Table of Contents $20 million increase in the value of forward sales of electricity and fuel due to favorable power and gas prices and a $14 million gain from hedge accounting ineffectiveness. This ineffectiveness was primarily related to gas swaps and collars in the Texas region due to a change in the correlation between natural gas and power prices. NRG also recognized a $49 million unrealized gain associated with the Companys trading activity. Since these hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk of commodity price movements on revenues and cost of energy sold, the changes in such results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather taken together with the effects of pricing and cost changes on energy revenues. In late 2006 and during the course of 2007, NRG hedged a portion of the Companys 2007 and 2008 generation. Since that time, the settled and forward prices of electricity and natural gas have decreased, resulting in the recognition of unrealized mark to market forward gains and the settlement of realized positions at a gain. In 2006, NRG recognized forward mark to market gains as forward prices of electricity decreased relative to its positions forward; settled loss positions were driven by the out of market gas swaps acquired with the Texas Genco purchase. Cost of Operations Cost of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased by $113 million compared to 2006, but as a percentage of revenues it was 56% for 2007 compared to 58% for 2006. Cost of energy cost of energy decreased by approximately $24 million, to $2,428 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, and as a percentage of revenue it decreased from 44% for the year ended December 31, 2006, to 41% for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was due to: Texas decreased by $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. This included an additional months expense of $96 million in 2007, without which cost of energy would have decreased by $191 million. This decrease was due to a reduction in natural gas expense and fuel contract amortization, partially offset by increased ancillary service expense. Fuel expense and purchased power expense Natural gas expense decreased by $170 million, which excludes January 2007 natural gas expense of $27 million. This was due to a decrease of 2.7 million MWh in gas fired generation as a result of cooler summer weather, coupled with greater economic purchases from ERCOT and increased baseload generation. Despite higher coal fired generation at the regions W.A. Parish and Limestone plants, the regions coal expenses, excluding January 2007, decreased by $13 million due to a 9% reduction in average contracted coal prices. Fuel contract amortization decreased by approximately $43 million, excluding January 2007, due to declining forward fuel price curves below the contracted prices used at Acquisition. Purchased ancillary service expense increased by approximately $34 million due to favorable market prices in purchasing this service in the market compared to providing the service from internal resources. Northeast cost of energy increased by $26 million primarily due to $30 million in higher natural gas costs related to increased generation at the regions Arthur Kill plant due to its locational advantage to New York City following transmission constraints during the last three quarters of 2007. South Central Cost of energy increased by $104 million due to increases in purchased energy, coal costs and transmission costs. Purchased energy increased by approximately $69 million due to increased market purchases following increased cooperative load requirements and planned maintenance at the regions Big Cajun II facility. Coal costs increased by approximately $17 million, of which $11 million was related to a 9% increase in coal prices and $7 million due to higher coal transportation costs. Transmission costs increased by approximately $16 million of which $6 million was due to contractual increases related to network transmission service. Point to point transmission costs also increased by $10 million reflecting more off system sales. 78 Table of Contents West Cost of energy decreased by approximately $76 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, due to new tolling agreement entered into at the Encina plant in 2007, which requires the counterparty to supply their own fuel. Under the previous arrangement in 2006, the plant supplied the fuel. Other operating costs Other operating costs which includes operations and maintenance expenses, or OM, increased by $137 million, to $950 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. This increase was due to: Texas other operating costs increased by $75 million, after excluding January 2007 expense of $39 million, other operating costs increased by $36 million. This $36 million increase was due to $25 million in higher OM expense as a result of increased maintenance associated with planned outages and fuel handling at the W.A. Parish facility and $10 million in higher property tax expenses following an increased valuation after the Acquisition. Northeast other operating costs increased by $18 million due to increased staffing costs and higher maintenance costs. South Central other operating costs increased by approximately $28 million, $19 million of which was due to increased maintenance expense primarily related to planned outages. Additionally, the region disposed of $4 million in assets in conjunction with the outage. Acquisition of WCP these results include $15 million of WCP expenses that were not included in the Companys results in 2006. Depreciation and Amortization NRGs depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased by $68 million compared to 2006. This increase was due to: Texas acquisition the inclusion of Texas results for twelve months in 2007 compared to eleven months in 2006 resulted in an increase of approximately $38 million. Impact of new environmental legislation due to new and more restrictive environmental legislation, the useful life of certain pollution control equipment has been reduced. The Company accelerated depreciation on certain equipment in its Northeast region to reflect the remaining useful life, resulting in increased depreciation of approximately $13 million. General and Administrative NRGs GA costs for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased by $33 million compared to 2006, and as a percentage of revenues was 5% in both 2007 and 2006. This increase was due to: Texas and WCP acquisitions the inclusion of Texas results for twelve months in 2007 compared to eleven months in 2006 and the consolidation of WCP for the last three quarters of 2006 resulted in an increase of approximately $9 million. Wage and benefit costs due to the expansion of the Company, including RepoweringNRG initiatives, wages and related benefits costs resulted in a $28 million increase in GA. Additionally, information technology and other office services to support this expansion increased by $8 million. Franchise tax the Companys Louisiana state franchise tax increased by approximately $6 million. This was because the states franchise tax is assessed based on the Companys total debt and equity that increased significantly following the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. Non recurring expenses during 2006 for the year ended December 31, 2006, GA included non recurring fees of $20 million of which $6 million were related to the unsolicited takeover attempt by Mirant Corporation and $14 million associated with the Texas integration efforts. 79 Table of Contents Development Costs NRGs development costs for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased by $65 million. These costs were due to the Companys RepoweringNRG projects: Texas on September 24, 2007, NRG filed a COLA with the NRC to build and operate two new nuclear units at the STP site. During the period, NRG incurred $91 million in development costs related to STP units 3 and 4 project in 2007. These development costs were reduced by a $39 million reimbursement related to a partnership agreement signed during the fourth quarter 2007. Wind projects approximately $13 million in development costs related to wind projects primarily in Texas. Other project approximately $4 million in development costs related to other RepoweringNRG projects in the West region. Gain on Sale of Assets NRGs net gain on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2007, was approximately $17 million. On January 3, 2007, NRG completed the sale of the Companys Red Bluff and Chowchilla II power plants resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately $18 million. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates NRGs equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2007, decreased by $6 million compared to 2006. This decrease was due to the sale of multiple equity investments from which the Company earned $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other Income, Net NRGs other income for the year ended December 31, 2007, decreased by $101 million compared to 2006. This decrease was due to the non cash settlement during the first quarter 2006 where NRG recorded $67 million of other income associated with a settlement with an equipment manufacturer related to turbine purchase agreements entered into in 1999 and 2001. The settlement resulted in the reversal of accounts payable totaling $35 million resulting from the discharge of the previously recorded liability, and an adjustment to write up the value of the equipment received to its fair value, resulting in income of approximately $32 million. Additionally, in 2006, other income was favorably impacted by a $13 million non cash gain associated with the discharge of liabilities upon dissolution of an inactive legal entity and a $5 million non cash gain due to a favorable settlement with respect to post closing adjustments on the acquisition of the Companys western New York plants. During 2007, the Company recorded an $11 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter related to an investment in commercial paper reducing its carrying value to approximately $32 million. The Company earned $10 million less in interest income in 2007 compared to 2006, due to lower average cash balances. Interest Expense NRGs interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased by $99 million compared to 2006. This increase was due to: Refinancing for the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC in February 2006 the Company significantly increased its corporate debt facilities from approximately $2 billion as of December 31, 2005, to approximately $7 billion as of February 2, 2006. This increased interest expense by approximately $12 million compared to 2006. Increase of $1.1 billion in debt for Hedge Reset the Company issued $1.1 billion in Senior Notes due 2017 in November 2006 related to the Hedge Reset, which increased interest expense by approximately $72 million. 80 Table of Contents Capital Allocation Program the Company issued a total of $330 million of debt to fund Phase I of the Capital Allocation Program during the second half of 2006. This increased interest expense by $20 million compared to 2006. In the first quarter 2006, NRG entered into interest rate swaps with the objective of fixing the interest rate on a portion of NRGs Senior Credit Facility. These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, and the impact associated with ineffectiveness was immaterial to NRG financial results. For the year ended December 31, 2007, NRG had a deferred loss of $31 million in other comprehensive income compared to deferred gains of $16 million in 2006. Refinancing Expense Refinancing expense decreased by $152 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to higher expense for the refinancing of the Companys corporate debt for the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC on February 2, 2006, compared to the refinancing of the Companys Senior Credit Facility during 2007. On June 8, 2007, NRG completed a $4.4 billion refinancing of the Companys Senior Credit Facility previously announced on May 2, 2007. The transaction resulted in a 0.25% reduction on the spread that the Company pays on its term loan and Synthetic Letter of Credit facility, a $200 million reduction in the Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility to $1.3 billion, and various amendments to provide improved flexibility, efficiency for returning capital to shareholders, asset repowering and investment opportunities. The pricing on the Companys term loan and Synthetic Letter of Credit are also subject to further reductions upon the achievement of certain financial ratios. The refinancing resulted in a charge of approximately $35 million to the Companys results of operations that were primarily related to the write off of deferred financing costs as the lenders for approximately 45% of the Term B loan either exited the financing or reduced their holdings and were replaced by other institutions. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased by $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. The effective tax rate was 39.9% and 37.2% for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 (In millions except otherwise stated) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 946 $ 865 Tax at 35% 331 303 State taxes, net of federal benefit 46 34 Foreign operations (13 ) (21 ) Subpart F taxable income 11 Valuation allowance, including change in state effective rate 6 (10 ) Change in state effective tax rate 21 Claimant reserve settlements (28 ) Change in local German effective tax rates (29 ) Foreign dividends 26 1 Non deductible interest 10 3 Permanent differences, reserves, other 8 Income tax expense $ 377 $ 322 Effective income tax rate 39.9 % 37.2 % 81 Table of Contents The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to: Increase in profits income before tax increased by $81 million, with a corresponding increase of approximately $32 million in income tax expense. Permanent differences the Companys effective tax rate differs from the US statutory rate of 35% due to: Change in German tax rate due to a reduction in the German statutory and resulting effective tax rate, income tax expense benefited by $29 million for the year ended 2007. Taxable dividends from foreign subsidiaries in January 2007, the Company transferred the proceeds from the sale of its Flinders assets to the U.S. creating additional income tax expense of approximately $25 million. Lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions lower income tax rates at the Companys foreign locations resulted in additional income tax expense during 2007 compared to 2006 of $8 million. Non deductible interest interest expense from the stock buybacks from Phase I of the Companys Capital Allocation Program were non deductible for income tax purposes, thus increasing income tax expense by approximately $7 million. Change in state effective tax rate the state effective tax rate remains unchanged for 2007. This resulted in a net decrease in income tax expense of approximately $5 million as compared to 2006, after taking into account the movement in valuation allowance as a result of the change in rate from 2005 to 2006. Subpart F taxable income a dividend was declared and paid in 2007 by NRGenerating International B.V. As result of this dividend, there was no Subpart F income compared to 2006. This resulted in a decrease to income tax expense of approximately $11 million. Disputed claims reserve During 2007 as compared to 2006, the Company made no distribution from its disputed claims reserve, this increased income tax expense by approximately $28 million. The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances in accordance with SFAS 109. These factors and others, including the Companys history of pre tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax Expense NRG classifies as discontinued operations the income from operations and gains/losses recognized on the sale of projects that were sold or were deemed to have met the required criteria for such classification pending final disposition. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, NRG recorded income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense of $17 million and $78 million, respectively. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 were comprised of the results of ITISA. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 were comprised of the results of ITISA, Flinders, Audrain and Resource Recovery. NRG closed on the sale of Flinders during the third quarter 2006 and recognized an after tax gain of approximately $60 million from the sale. 82 Table of Contents 2006 compared to 2005 The following table provides selected financial information for NRG Energy, Inc., for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 3,155 $ 1,840 71 % Capacity revenue 1,516 563 169 Risk management activities 124 (292 ) NA Contract amortization 628 9 NA Thermal revenue 124 124 Hedge Reset (129 ) NA Other revenues 167 156 7 Total operating revenues 5,585 2,400 133 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of operations 3,265 1,829 79 Depreciation and amortization 590 158 273 General and administrative 276 176 57 Development costs 36 NA Other charges 12 NA Total operating costs and expenses 4,167 2,175 92 Operating Income 1,418 225 530 Other Income/(Expense) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 60 104 (42 ) Write downs and gains/(losses) on sales of equity method investments 8 (31 ) NA Other income, net 156 54 189 Refinancing expenses (187 ) (65 ) 188 Interest expense (590 ) (177 ) 233 Total other expenses (553 ) (115 ) 381 Income from Continuing Operations before income tax expense 865 110 686 Income tax expense 322 42 667 Income from Continuing Operations 543 68 699 Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense 78 16 388 Net Income $ 621 $ 84 639 Business Metrics Average natural gas price Henry Hub ($/MMbtu) 6.99 8.89 (21 )% N/A Not applicable 83 Table of Contents For the benefit of the following discussions, the table below represents the results of NRG excluding the impact of the Companys Texas region, the Hedge Reset and WCP: Year Ended December 31, 2006 Total excluding 2005 Consolidated Texas Region WCP Texas Region/WCP Consolidated (In millions) Energy revenue $ 3,155 $ 1,726 $ 72 $ 1,357 $ 1,840 Capacity revenue 1,516 849 64 603 563 Risk management activities 124 (30 ) 154 (292 ) Contract amortization 628 609 19 9 Thermal revenue 124 124 124 Hedge Reset (129 ) (129 ) Other revenues 167 63 5 99 156 Total Operating revenues 5,585 3,088 141 2,356 2,400 Cost of operations 3,265 1,669 112 1,484 1,829 Depreciation and amortization 590 413 2 175 158 General and administrative 276 111 6 159 176 Development costs 36 14 4 18 Other charges 12 Total operating costs and expenses 4,167 2,207 124 1,836 2,175 Operating Income $ 1,418 $ 881 $ 17 $ 520 $ 225 Operating revenues increased by $3,185 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 2005. However, excluding the Companys Texas region, the Hedge Reset transaction and WCP, total operating revenues decreased by approximately $44 million. Energy revenues energy revenues increased by $1,315 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 2005 with 50% contracted in 2006 compared to 13% in 2005. Excluding the Texas region and WCP, energy revenues decreased by approximately $483 million or 26%. Texas The acquisitions of Texas Genco LLC now referred to as the Companys Texas region, contributed $3,088 million to operating revenues including $1,726 million of energy revenues. West The acquisition of Dynegys 50% interest in WCP contributed $72 million to total energy revenues. Northeast generation demand for the Northeast regions intermediate and peaking plants declined by 54%, accompanied by a 19% to 23% year over year decline in power prices in the Northeast regions three major markets. Capacity revenues capacity revenues were $1,516 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $563 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $953 million. This was due to: Texas the acquisitions of Texas Genco LLC now referred to as the Companys Texas region, contributed $3,088 million to operating revenues including $849 million of capacity revenues. West The acquisition of Dynegys 50% interest in WCP contributed $64 million to total capacity revenues. Northeast Higher capacity prices for the New York Rest of State market, led to a $30 million increase in the Northeast regions 2006 capacity revenues. 84 Table of Contents South Central The regions capacity revenues also grew by $9 million as pricing increased due to increased peak demand. Hedge Reset In November 2006, NRG executed a series of transactions designed to both extend and strengthen the Companys baseload hedging positions and to enable further optimization of the Companys ongoing Capital Allocation Program. It involved net settling legacy Texas region long term power contracts and gas swaps by negotiating prices to current market levels with certain counterparties. This resulted in the accelerated amortization of approximately $1,073 million of out of market power contracts and $145 million of gas swaps derivative liability offset by a payment of approximately $1,347 million to the counterparties, for a net reduction of approximately $129 million in the Companys total operating revenues. In addition, as part of NRGs Hedge Reset transactions, the Company recorded $6 million of costs related to the transaction. Risk Management Activity The following table shows NRGs risk management activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment for the year ended December 31, 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2006 South Texas Northeast Central Other Total (In millions) Net losses on settled positions, or financial revenues $ (152 ) $ (10 ) $ (6 ) $ (3 ) $ (171 ) Mark to market results Reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on settled positions related to economic hedges 115 1 116 Reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on settled positions related to trading activity (25 ) (1 ) (26 ) Net unrealized gains on open positions related to economic hedges 122 50 172 Net unrealized gains on open positions related to trading activity 14 19 33 Subtotal mark to market results 122 154 19 295 Total derivative gains/(losses) $ (30 ) $ 144 $ 13 $ (3 ) $ 124 Risk management activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment resulted in a total derivative gain of approximately $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a $292 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2005. These losses were comprised of $171 million in settled financial revenue losses and $295 million of mark to market gains. The $171 million loss in financial revenues represents the settled value for financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and were primarily related to $152 million in losses of gas swaps acquired with the purchase of Texas Genco LLC. Of the $295 million in mark to market gains, $172 million represents the change in the fair value of forward sales of electricity and fuel, including $28 million of hedge accounting ineffectiveness related to hedge contracts in the Companys Texas region due to a decline in the correlation between natural gas and power prices. In addition, $90 million of the $295 million mark to market gains represents the reversal of mark to market losses, which ultimately settled as financial revenues. NRG also recognized a $33 million unrealized gain associated with the Companys trading activity. Since NRGs risk management activities are intended to mitigate the risk of commodity price movements on revenues and cost of energy sold, the changes in these results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather taken together with the effects of pricing and cost changes on energy revenues (which are recorded net of financial instrument hedges that qualify for hedge accounting treatment). In late 2005 and during the course of 2006, NRG hedged a portion of the Companys 2007 generation. After entering into those transactions the forward prices of electricity decreased, mainly due to mild weather for much of the year in the Northeast region and the downward trend in natural gas prices in 2006. While settled prices also decreased, the Companys 2007 settled loss position was driven by the out of market gas swaps acquired with the Texas Genco purchase. In 2005, forward mark to market losses and the settlement of positions at losses was related to the run up in natural gas prices which occurred in the wake of hurricane Katrina and Rita resulting in the recognition of mark to market forward sales as gains. 85 Table of Contents Cost of Operations Cost of operations includes cost of energy, operating and maintenance expenses, and non income tax expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2006, cost of operations was $3,265 million or 58% of total operating revenues compared to $1,829 million, or 76%, of total operating revenues for 2005, an increase of $1,436 million. This increase in absolute terms, but decrease in relative percentage terms, was primarily due to the acquisition of the Companys Texas region which incurred costs of $1,669 million. Cost of energy which includes fuels, purchased power, and cost contract amortization increased from $1,427 million for 2005 to $2,452 million in 2006. The increase of $1,025 million was primarily due to: Texas The acquisitions of Texas Genco LLC now referred to as the Companys Texas region, increased cost of energy by approximately $1,276 million. West The acquisition of Dynegys 50% interest in WCP increased cost of energy by approximately $79 million. This was partially offset by lower cost of energy in the: Northeast cost of energy decreased by $254 million, due to $143 million lower oil costs and $101 million in lower gas fuel costs as a result of lower generation from oil and gas fired assets of approximately 70% and 45%, respectively. South Central cost of energy decreased by $66 million in 2006, as higher coal plant availability and increased utilization of the regions tolling agreements reduced the need to purchase energy to support contract load requirements. Other operating costs increased in 2006 by $411 million to $813 million, $393 million related to the acquisition of the Companys Texas region and $33 million for WCP. Excluding the impact of NRG Texas and WCP, other operating costs were $15 million lower than last year primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs, which benefited in the second quarter 2006 from an accrual reversal of $18 million related to a favorable court decision in a station service dispute at NRGs Western New York plants. In addition, as part of NRGs Hedge Reset transactions, the Company recorded $6 million of costs related to the transaction. Depreciation and Amortization NRGs annual depreciation and amortization expense for 2006 and 2005 was $590 million and $158 million, respectively. The Texas regions depreciation and amortization comprised $413 million of the $432 million year over year increase. General and Administrative NRGs GA costs for 2006 were $276 million compared to $176 million in the previous year. Corporate costs represented $143 million, or 3% of 2006 total operating revenues and $112 million, or 5% of the Companys 2005 total operating revenues. Excluding WCP and the Companys Texas region GA was lower by $17 million, despite having been adversely impacted by $6 million of costs associated with the unsolicited acquisition offer by Mirant Corporation and approximately $14 million of NRG Texas integration costs. Development Costs NRG incurred approximately $36 million in development expenses in 2006 to support its RepoweringNRG program. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity earnings from NRGs investments in unconsolidated affiliates were $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decline of approximately 42%. The decline in earnings was primarily due to: 86 Table of Contents Purchase of remaining 50% interest in WCP NRGs purchase of the remaining 50% interest in WCP accounted for $21 million of the decline, as the results of WCP were fully consolidated as of March 31, 2006. As part of that transaction, NRG sold its 50% interest in the Rocky Road investment, which accounted for $7 million of the decline in total equity earnings. Sale of Non Core Assets NRGs Enfield investment, which was sold on April 1, 2005, earned $16 million during 2005. Sales of other equity investments in 2006 included James River, Cadillac and certain Latin American power funds. This was partially offset by a $4 million improvement in equity income from the Companys MIBRAG investment which experienced improved results compared to 2005 as a result of fewer customer outages. Write Downs and Gains/(Losses) on Sales of Equity Method Investments During 2006, NRG continued to divest of its non core assets by selling the Companys interests in James River and Cadillac, as well as interests in certain Latin American power funds for a pre tax loss of $6 million, a pre tax gain of $11 million and a pre tax gain of $3 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, NRG recorded a $31 million loss due to the sale and impairment of certain equity investments. On April 1, 2005, NRG sold its 25% interest in Enfield, resulting in net pre tax proceeds of $65 million and a pre tax gain of $12 million. In 2005, NRG also sold its interest in Kendall and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $4 million. These gains on sales were offset by approximately $47 million in impairment charges recorded last year. In December 2005, NRG executed an agreement with Dynegy to sell the Companys 50% interest in Rocky Road LLC in conjunction with NRGs purchase of Dynegys 50% interest in WCP. Based on the terms of the transaction which valued the Companys investment in Rocky Road at $45 million, NRG impaired its interest in Rocky Road by writing down the value of the investment by approximately $20 million. The sale of Rocky Road closed on March 31, 2006. In 2005, NRG also recorded an impairment of $27 million on its investment in the Saguaro power plant. With the expiration of the plants long term gas supply contract, the Saguaro power plant became exposed to the risk of fluctuating natural gas prices beginning in the second half of 2005, triggering a permanent write down of NRGs investment value in Saguaro. Other Income, Net Other income increased by $102 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $156 million compared to the same period in 2005. Other income in 2006 was favorably impacted by $67 million of income associated with a non cash settlement with an equipment manufacturer related to turbine purchase agreements entered into in 1999 and 2001, a $13 million non cash gain associated with the discharge of liabilities upon dissolution of an inactive legal entity, and $5 million from the favorable settlement with respect to post closing adjustments on the acquisition of the Companys western New York plants in 1998 and 1999. Other income was also favorably impacted in 2006 by $25 million of higher interest income related to higher levels of cash and more efficient management of cash balances. Refinancing Expenses Refinancing expenses incurred in 2006 and 2005 were $187 million and $65 million, respectively. In the first quarter 2006, this was due to: Refinancing for the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC NRG partially financed the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC through borrowings under new debt facilities and repaid and terminated previous debt facilities. As a result of this financing, the Company incurred $178 million of refinancing expenses: $127 million was related to the premium paid to NRGs previous debt holders, $34 million for the amortization of the remaining balance of a bridge loan commitment entered into on September 30, 2005, and $31 million related to write offs of deferred financing costs associated with NRGs previous debt, and a credit of $14 million related to a debt premium write off. Redemption of Second Priority Notes In 2005, NRG redeemed and purchased a total of approximately $645 million of the Companys second priority notes. As a result of the redemption and purchases, NRG 87 Table of Contents incurred approximately $54 million in premiums and write offs of deferred financing costs. NRG also incurred an additional $11 million in refinancing fees during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to the amortization of a bridge loan commitment fee that the Company paid related to acquisition financing. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $590 million compared to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to: Financing for the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC interest on new debt issued to finance the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. See Item 15 Note 3, Discontinued Operations, Business Acquisitions and Dispositions, and Note 11, Debt and Capital Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the acquisition and the related financing. As part of the refinancing, NRG replaced its previous senior secured term loan with a new $3.575 billion senior secured term loan. In addition, NRG retired $1.1 billion of its 8% second priority notes and issued $3.6 billion in senior unsecured notes with a weighted average interest rate of 7.33%. In the first quarter 2006, NRG entered into interest rate swaps with the objective of fixing the interest rate on a portion of the Companys new Senior Credit Facility. These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS 133, and any impact associated with ineffectiveness was immaterial to NRGs financial results. For the year ended December 31, 2006, NRG had deferred gains of $16 million in other comprehensive income associated with these swaps. See also Item 15 Note 11, Debt and Capital Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on these interest rate swaps. In addition, NRG designated an existing fixed to floating interest rate swap, previously as a hedge of NRGs 8% second priority notes, into a fair value hedge of the Senior Notes, which NRG closed on February 2, 2006. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased by $280 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 2005. The effective tax rate was 37.2% and 38.2% for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Increase in profits income before tax increased by $755 million, with a corresponding increase of approximately $299 million in tax expense. 88 Table of Contents Permanent differences the Companys effective tax rate differs from the US statutory rate of 35% due to: Change in state effective tax rate the state effective tax rate was changed which resulted in a net increase to income tax expense of approximately $11 million, as compared to 2005, inclusive of the movement in valuation allowance resulting from the change in state effective tax rate. Disputed claims reserve during 2006, the Company made distributions from its disputed claims reserve decreasing 2006 income tax expense by approximately $28 million. The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances in accordance with SFAS 109. These factors and others, including the Companys history of pre tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax Expense NRG classifies as discontinued operations the income from operations and gains/losses recognized on the sale of projects that were sold or were deemed to have met the required criteria for such classification pending final disposition. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, NRG recorded income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense of $78 million and $16 million, respectively. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 were comprised of the results of ITISA, Flinders, Audrain and Resource Recovery. Discontinued operations for 2005 consisted of the results of ITISA, Flinders, Audrain, Resource Recovery, Northbrook New York LLC, Northbrook Energy LLC and NRG McClain LLC. NRG closed on the sale of Flinders during the third quarter 2006 and recognized an after tax gain of approximately $60 million from the sale. Discontinued operations for the full year 2005 included an $11 million gain on the disposition of NRGs Northbrook New York and Northbrook Energy operations. 89 Table of Contents Results of Operations Regional Discussions Texas Region The following table provides selected financial information for the Texas region for the year ended December 31, 2007, and the period ended December 31, 2006.

Operating Income For the year ended December 31, 2007, operating income increased by $88 million compared to 2006, however excluding January 2007 results, operating income increased by $21 million. The primary drivers were: Energy Revenues for eleven months of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 were up by $755 million, $449 million of which was due to the Hedge Reset transaction, as the average price of the underlying power contracts increased by $13 per MWh compared to average contract prices prior to the hedge reset. The balance of the increase in energy revenues was due to the sale of additional output as energy rather than under PUCT mandated capacity auctions. 90 Table of Contents This favorable result was offset by: Capacity Revenues reduction in capacity auction sales reduced capacity revenues by approximately $517 million, excluding January 2007. Contract Amortization the Hedge Reset transaction decreased contract amortization by approximately $498 million, excluding January 2007. Gas fired Generation lower natural gas fired generation of approximately 2.7 million MWh, for the comparable eleven month period in 2007, was a result of cooler summer weather coupled with increased economic purchases of energy and ancillary services from ERCOT. Lower sales revenue for the eleven months was offset by natural lower natural gas fuel costs of $170 million and cash flow economic hedge improvements. Development Costs increased by $44 million in 2007 compared to 2006 largely due to the development of STP nuclear units 3 and 4 project, including $2 million of expenses in January 2007. The $44 million increase also includes $39 million in reimbursements from a partnership agreement signed in the fourth quarter 2007. Operating Revenues Total operating revenues from the Texas region increased by $199 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. Excluding January 2007, operating revenues decreased by $56 million. This decrease was due to: Energy revenues energy revenues increased by $972 million of which $217 million was due to the inclusion of twelve months activity in 2007 compared to eleven months in 2006. Of the remaining $755 million increase, $449 million was due to the Hedge Reset transaction which resulted in higher 2007 average contracted prices of approximately $13 per MWh. In addition, revenues from 8.8 million MWh of generation moved from capacity revenue to energy revenue. Prior to the Acquisition, PUCT regulations required that NRG Texas sell 15% of its capacity by auction at reduced rates. In March 2006, the PUCT accepted NRGs request to no longer participate in these auctions and that capacity is now being sold in the merchant market. These favorable results were partially offset by lower sales from natural gas fired units due to a cooler summer which resulted in lower natural gas fired generation of approximately 2.7 million MWh. Other revenues the regions other revenues decreased by $27 million for the eleven months of 2007 compared to 2006. This was due to a decrease in intercompany emission allowance sales of $40 million and a $19 million decrease in physical gas sales. This $59 million decrease was offset by a $33 million increase in ancillary services revenue due to a change in strategy to more actively provide ancillary services in the Texas region. Capacity revenues capacity revenues decreased by $517 million, excluding $31 million incurred in January 2007. This decrease was due to the reduction of capacity auction sales mandated by the PUCT in prior years as described above. Contract amortization revenues from contract amortization excluding January 2007 decreased by $405 million primarily due to the write off of out of market power contracts during the fourth quarter 2006 related to the Hedge Reset transaction. Risk management activities The Texas region recorded a total of $33 million in derivative losses for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to a $30 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2006. The Texas regions 2007 derivative loss was comprised of $66 million of mark to market losses and $33 million in settled gains, or financial revenue. Of the $66 million of mark to market losses, $83 million represents the reversal of mark to market gains previously recognized on economic hedges and $1 million from the reversal of mark to market gains previously recognized on trading activity. Both of these losses ultimately settled as financial revenues during 2007. The $19 million gain from economic hedge positions was comprised of an $8 million increase in the value of forward sales of electricity and fuel due to favorable power and natural gas prices and a $11 million gain 91 Table of Contents from hedge accounting ineffectiveness. This ineffectiveness was primarily related to gas swaps and collars due to a change in the correlation between natural gas and power prices. Cost of Energy Cost of energy for the Texas region decreased by $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. This included an additional months expense for January 2007 of $96 million, without which cost of energy would have decreased by $191 million. This was due to: Fuel expense natural gas expense decreased by $170 million, excluding the January 2007 expense of $27 million, due to a decrease of 2.7 million MWh in natural gas fired generation as a result of cooler summer weather, coupled with greater economic purchases of energy and ancillary services from ERCOT and increased baseload generation. Coal expenses, excluding January 2007, decreased by $13 million due to an 9% reduction in average contracted coal prices in 2007, despite a 1.1 million MWh increase in coal fired generation at the regions W.A. Parish and Limestone plants. Purchased ancillary service increased by approximately $34 million due to the favorable market prices in purchasing this service in the market compared to providing the service from internal resources causing an associated decrease in natural gas expense. Fuel contract Amortization decreased by approximately $43 million, excluding January 2007, due to declining forward fuel price curves below the contracted prices used at acquisition in February 2006. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the Texas region increased by $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This included an additional months expense for January 2007, of $53 million, without which other operating expenses would have increased by $97 million. This was due to: Development costs on September 24, 2007, NRG filed a COLA with the NRC. The Company incurred $91 million in development costs related to STP nuclear unit 3 and 4 project in 2007, including $2 million in January 2007, compared to development costs of $14 million in 2006. Of the $91 million incurred this year, $39 million was reimbursed through a partnership agreement in the fourth quarter 2007. Fossil development costs was $6 million in 2007. Plant OM expense increased by $25 million, excluding January 2007, due to increased maintenance associated with planned outages and fuel handling at W.A. Parish, increased maintenance related to higher utilization in 2006 of the regions natural gas fleet, and retirement of older assets. Corporate allocations were higher by approximately $16 million. Property tax expense increased by approximately $10 million related to the Texas acquisition. 92 Table of Contents Northeast Region 2007 compared to 2006 The following table provides selected financial information for the Northeast region for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 1,104 $ 966 14 % Capacity revenue 402 321 25 Risk management activities 27 144 (81 ) Other revenues 72 112 (36 ) Total operating revenues 1,605 1,543 4 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 641 615 4 Depreciation and amortization 102 89 15 Other operating expenses 404 378 7 Operating Income $ 458 $ 461 (1 ) MWh sold (in thousands) 14,163 13,309 6 MWh generated (in thousands) 14,163 13,309 6 Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 76.37 $ 67.73 13 Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 702 653 8 CDDs 30 year rolling average 537 537 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 6,074 5,417 12 % HDDs 30 year rolling average 6,261 6,261 (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. An HDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. Operating Income Operating income decreased by $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to: Cost of energy increased by approximately $26 million due to a 6% increase in generation at the regions coal and natural gas fired plants. Other operating expenses increased by $26 million primarily due to increased maintenance and staffing costs combined with higher property tax. Depreciation increased by $13 million reflecting the additional depreciation expense following the reduction in estimated useful lives of certain components of the regions power plants as a result of new environmental regulation. Offset by higher operating revenues of approximately $62 million due to increased generation, favorable pricing and the favorable impact from new capacity markets. This was partially offset by lower gains in the regions risk management activities and lower sales of emission allowances due to a 28% reduction in market prices. 93 Table of Contents Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased by $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to: Energy revenues increased by approximately $138 million, of which $61 million was due to increased generation, and $88 million due to a 9% increase in average realized market prices partially offset by an $11 million reduction in contracted bilateral energy revenues. Generation increased by 6%, primarily driven by increases at the regions Arthur Kill, Oswego and Indian River plants. The Arthur Kill plant increased generation by 448 thousand MWh due to transmission constraints around New York City, the Oswego plants generation increased by 127 thousand MWh due to a colder winter during 2007 compared to 2006, and Indian River plants generation increased by 418 thousand MWh due to stronger pricing and fewer outages. Price on average, realized prices in the Northeast increased by 9% due to a mix of higher priced New York City generation coupled with improved economic energy hedge trading resulting in a $37 million increase in energy revenues. Capacity revenues increased by $81 million, of which $39 million was from the regions NEPOOL assets, $36 million from the regions PJM assets and $6 million from the regions New York Rest of State assets. NEPOOL The regions NEPOOL assets benefited from the new LFRM market and transition capacity market, both of which were introduced in the fourth quarter 2006. Capacity revenues increased by $24 million from the LFRM market and $18 million from transition capacity payments, which were partially offset by a $3 million reduction due to the expiration of an RMR agreement for the regions Devon plant on December 31, 2006 and by RMR payments from the regions Norwalk plant which began in the third quarter 2007. PJM On June 1, 2007, the new RPM capacity market became effective in PJM increasing capacity revenues by approximately $36 million. NYISO New York Rest of State capacity prices increased by 75% as load requirement growth increased demand for capacity. This was coupled with the impact from the new capacity markets in NEPOOL which reduced exported supply into the New York market that further improved the supply/demand dynamics. These were partially offset by: Risk management activities The Northeast region recorded $27 million in derivative gain for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to a $144 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2006. The regions 2007 derivative gain was comprised of $16 million of mark to market losses and $43 million in settled gains, or financial revenue. Of the $16 million of mark to market losses, $45 million represents the reversal of mark to market gains previously recognized on economic hedges and $12 million from the reversal of mark to market gains previously recognized on trading activity. Both of these losses ultimately settled as financial revenues during 2007. The region also recognized a $15 million unrealized gain from economic hedge positions which was comprised primarily of a $13 million increase in the value of forward sales of electricity and fuel due to favorable power and gas prices. The region also recognized a $26 million unrealized gain associated with the Companys trading activity. The $144 million derivative gain for the year ended December 31, 2006 was comprised of a $154 million unrealized mark to market gain and $10 million in settled losses. Most of these unrealized gains reversed out in 2007. Other revenues decreased by $40 million, of which approximately $48 million was due to reduced activity in the trading of emission allowances following both an increase in generation and a 28% decrease in market prices. This decrease was partially offset by an $11 million increase in physical gas sales to third parties due to favorable trading opportunities in the market. 94 Table of Contents Cost of Energy Cost of energy increased by $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to $30 million in higher natural gas costs related to increased generation at the regions Arthur Kill plant due to its locational advantage to New York City following transmission constraints during the last three quarters of 2007. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased by $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to: Plant OM spending of $15 million due to increased plant staffing costs of $7 million, increased maintenance costs of $6 million and increased environmental remediation costs of $2 million. Property tax increased by approximately $3 million due to a favorable tax decision in 2006 related to NYC assets of $10 million partially offset by a tax law change the same year that resulted in a reduction of property tax receivable of $5 million in 2006 and a $2 million reduction in property taxes at the New England plants in 2007. Regional GA expenditures Regional staffing and benefits increased by $3 million primarily related to the regions RepoweringNRG development efforts while corporate allocations increased by $5 million. 2006 compared to 2005 The following table provides selected financial information for the Northeast region for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 966 $ 1,444 (33 )% Capacity revenue 321 291 10 Risk management activities 144 (285 ) N/A Other revenues 112 104 8 Total operating revenues 1,543 1,554 (1 ) Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 615 869 (29 ) Depreciation and amortization 89 74 20 Other operating expenses $ 378 $ 393 (4 ) Operating Income 461 218 111 MWh sold (in thousands) 13,309 16,246 (18 ) MWh generated (in thousands) 13,309 16,246 (18 ) Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 67.73 $ 91.98 (26 ) Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 653 801 (18 ) CDDs 30 year rolling average 537 537 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 5,417 6,162 (12 )% HDDs 30 year rolling average 6,261 6,261 (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region.

The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. Operating Income For the year ended December 31, 2006, operating income for the Northeast region was $461 million, compared to $218 million for the same period in 2005, an increase of $243 million. This was due to: Risk management activities of $144 million in mark to market gains from risk management activities, compared to a $285 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2005. The favorable gain from risk management activities was largely due to weak forward power prices, which resulted in substantial unrealized gains in the regions forward positions for the year ended December 31, 2006. In 2005, forward mark to market losses and settlement of positions at losses was related to the run up in natural gas prices which occurred in the wake of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Natural gas costs mild weather reduced demand for natural gas, with average prices falling as much as 22% year over year. Falling natural gas prices reduced annual average power prices in the New York, NEPOOL and PJM markets by 23%, 20% and 19%, respectively. This was partially offset by: Generation mild weather also led to an 18% decline in power generation for the Companys Northeast region to 13.3 million MWh in 2006, compared to 16.2 million MWh in 2005. Generation from the regions oil fired assets declined by nearly 2 million MWh, representing 66% of the overall Northeast regions generation decrease. Half of this decline was attributable to the regions Western New York plants, which had more run time in 2005 due to that years cold January winter. Total Operating Revenues Total operating revenues from NRGs Northeast region totaled $1,543 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $1,554 million for the same period in 2005, a decrease of $11 million. Energy revenues decreased by $478 million to $966 million due to lower generation from the regions Oswego plant and lower realized price from generation from the regions baseload coal plants which reduced energy revenues by $318 million. In addition, the region had $23 million of adjustments in 2005 relating to prior year NYISO settlements and a $6 million reversal of a reserve due to a favorable court decision regarding spinning reserve payments. Capacity revenues increased to $321 million, compared to $291 million for the same period in 2005. Of this increase, $28 million was due to higher capacity revenues in the New York State market. New York capacity revenues outside of New York City drove the increase in 2006, as increased demand for capacity, coupled with a decline in imports of capacity into the market, pushed clearing prices higher. Capacity prices were also favorably impacted in the regions New England market by $16 million due to the new LFRM market and the new transition capacity market. The Northeast region also earned $9 million more in RMR payments in 2006 with the approval of new RMR agreements. These were partially offset by $23 million of reserve reversals in 2005 following the settlement of prior year RMR agreements. Other revenues which include emission allowance sales, natural gas sales, and expense recovery revenues, totaled $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $104 million in the same period in 2005, an increase of $8 million. This increase was primarily related to $17 million in higher emission allowance sales as the Company sold emission allowances in lieu of generation during the first quarter 2006. Higher emission allowance revenues were partially offset by lower gas sales of $2 million, lower ancillary revenues of $3 million and lack of cost recovery revenues of $5 million related to the 2005 RMR agreements. Risk management activity The total derivative gain for the year was $144 million, comprised of $10 million in financial revenue losses and $154 million of unrealized mark to market gains. The $10 million loss of financial revenues represents the settled value for the year of all financial instruments, 96 Table of Contents including financial swaps and options on power. Of the $154 million of mark to market gains, $50 million represented the fair value of forward sales of electricity and fuel transactions to support the regions physical asset position, with $14 million of mark to market losses related to trading activity. In addition, $90 million represented the reversal of mark to market losses, which ultimately settled as financial revenues. In 2005, the total derivative loss was $285 million, comprised of $132 million in financial revenue losses and $153 million mark to market losses. Cost of Energy Cost of energy decreased by $254 million to $615 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 due to 18% lower generation from the regions generation assets which resulted in a $143 million decrease in oil fuel costs, as lower oil fired generation accounted for 66% of the total decline in generation volume. Gas fuel costs for the Northeast region decreased by $101 million. Coal costs increased by $11 million, despite slightly lower generation, primarily due to higher rail transportation costs. Emission allowance amortization costs declined in 2006 by $18 million, primarily due to lower generation, which resulted in lower consumption of emission allowances. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the Northeast region were $378 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of $15 million compared to the same period in 2005. This was due to: Plant utilities decreased by $20 million. This was primarily due to a favorable court decision in the second quarter 2006 that allowed the Northeast region to reverse into earnings $18 million of previously accrued station power expense. Insurance costs decreased by $8 million due to favorable renewals. Corporate allocations decreased by $14 million due to the inclusion of the Texas region in our allocation methodology. Offsetting these decreases were: Maintenance expense increased by $15 million in 2006 primarily due to more extensive boiler tube work at the regions Dunkirk and Arthur Kill plants to reduce forced outage hours, additional turbine maintenance and oil tank repair costs at the regions Oswego facility. Development costs increased by $8 million to advance the regions RepoweringNRG efforts. 97 Table of Contents South Central Region 2007 compared to 2006 The following table provides selected financial information for the South Central region for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 404 $ 334 21 % Capacity revenue 221 199 11 Risk management activities 10 13 (23 ) Contract amortization 23 19 21 Other revenues 5 N/A Total operating revenues 658 570 15 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 412 308 34 Depreciation and amortization 68 68 Other operating expenses 121 89 36 Operating Income $ 57 $ 105 (46 ) MWh sold (in thousands) 12,452 11,845 5 MWh generated (in thousands) 10,930 11,036 (1 ) Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 59.62 $ 56.18 6 Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 1,963 1,797 9 CDDs 30 year rolling average 1,547 1,547 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 3,236 3,169 2 % HDDs 30 year rolling average 3,604 3,604 (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region.

Operating Income Operating income for the region declined by $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to higher operating expenses, despite a 1% decrease in generation at the regions Big Cajun II plant. Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased by $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to: Energy revenues increased by approximately $70 million due to a new contract which contributed $69 million in contract energy revenues, increasing contract sales volume by approximately 1.3 million MWh. A contractual change in the fuel adjustment charge for the regions cooperative customers increased energy revenues by an additional $11 million. This was offset by a $12 million decrease in merchant energy revenue as a result of satisfying increasing load requirement from the new contract. 98 Table of Contents Capacity revenues increased by approximately $22 million, of which $15 million was due to higher rates as a result of the region setting new summer peaks in 2006 and 2007; the new system peak of 2,123 MW set in August 2007 will continue to impact capacity revenue in the first half of 2008. Higher network transmission costs, which are passed through to the regions cooperative customers, also increased capacity revenues by $6 million. Improved market conditions in PJM resulted in an increase of $3 million in merchant capacity revenue from the Rockford plants. Cost of Energy Cost of energy increased by $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to: Purchased energy increased by approximately $69 million as planned and maintenance outage hours at the regions Big Cajun II facility increased by 1,209 hours, primarily due to the planned turbine/generator outage at the Big Cajun II Unit 3 facility in the fourth quarter 2007. These increases were offset by a drop of $2.53/MWh in realized purchased power prices. Coal costs increased by approximately $17 million, of which approximately $11 million was due to a 9% increase in coal prices and $7 million due to higher coal transportation costs. Transmission costs increased by approximately $16 million. Network transmission costs, which are passed through to the regions cooperative customers, increased by $6 million due to load growth and increased utilization of the Entergy transmission system. Point to point transmission costs to support off system sales increased by $10 million. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased by approximately $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to: Maintenance expense increased by approximately $19 million as the scope of work on planned outages were more extensive in 2007. The Big Cajun II Unit 3 facility incurred a major planned outage in the fourth quarter 2007, during which the generator was rewound, turbine controls were replaced with a modern digital control system, and the turbine steam path was replaced with a high efficiency design. Asset disposals in conjunction with the outage added $4 million. Franchise tax Louisiana state franchise tax increased by approximately $6 million due to an increased assessment based on the Companys total debt and equity. The Companys total debt and equity increased significantly following the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC. 99 Table of Contents 2006 compared to 2005 The following table provides selected financial information for the South Central region for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 334 $ 339 (1 )% Capacity revenue 199 190 5 Risk management activities 13 (2 ) N/A Contract amortization 19 9 111 Other revenues 5 24 (79 ) Total operating revenues 570 560 2 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 308 374 (18 ) Depreciation and amortization 68 67 1 Other operating expenses 89 111 (20 ) Operating Income $ 105 $ 8 N/A MWh sold (in thousands) 11,845 11,771 1 MWh generated (in thousands) 11,036 10,009 10 Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 56.18 $ 69.96 (20 ) Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 1,797 1,811 (1 ) CDDs 30 year rolling average 1,547 1,547 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 3,169 3,366 (6 )% HDDs 30 year rolling average 3,604 3,604 (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. An HDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. Operating Income The South Central region realized operating income of $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to operating income of $8 million for the same period in 2005, an increase of $97 million. This was due to: Better plant availability due to lower planned and forced outages in 2006, which resulted in 11% higher coal generation in 2006 than 2005. The Big Cajun II facility achieved an EFOR of 3.13% in 2006 compared to 6.56% in 2005, resulting in 907 fewer forced outage hours in 2006. Lower outages In addition, the Big Cajun II coal units experienced 826 less planned outage hours in 2006 than in 2005. The forced outages in 2005 occurred primarily during the peak summer months when contract load is highest, requiring increased energy purchases than in 2006. These fewer planned outages in 2006 also resulted in $12 million of lower major maintenance expense, which benefited operating income. Favorable price spreads allowed for resale of power received from the regions tolling agreements, providing additional margins. 100 Table of Contents Total Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased by $10 million in 2006 compared to 2005. This was due to: Energy revenues increased sales to the regions contract customers were offset by lower sales in the merchant market. Capacity revenues were $9 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2006 than in the same period for 2005, as the peak of 2011 MW set by the regions cooperative customers in August 2006 impacted capacity revenue in the latter half of 2006. Risk management activities The region recognized $13 million from risk management activities in 2006. Contract amortization increased by $10 million due to increased megawatt hour sales to contract customers and the expiration of the Rockford contract in 2005. Other revenues decreased by $19 million from 2005 levels, primarily due to $23 million in lower gas sales relating to the regions tolling agreements. Cost of Energy Cost of energy for the South Central region was $308 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $374 million for the same period in 2005, a decrease of $66 million. This was due to: Lower purchased power the cost of purchased power, including the costs of the regions tolling agreements, was $74 million in 2006, a decrease of $71 million from 2005. This decrease was primarily due to fewer forced outages at the regions baseload coal plants in 2006 and the impact of netting energy purchases and resale. A drop in average purchased power prices by $9/MWh from 2005 to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in purchased power costs. As a result of improved plant availability, energy purchased by the South Central region to support load contracts dropped 16%. The South Central region increased its use of generation from tolled facilities in 2006; tolled combined cycle plants contributed 1,451,758 MWh to the regions energy resources in 2006 compared to 474,386 MWh in 2005. The tolling agreements further contributed to the regions results as the spread between gas costs and energy costs widened in the summer of 2006. This was partially offset by: Transmission costs increased by $7 million due to a combination of contractual increases in network transmission rates and higher peaks in 2006. Coal costs increased by $25 million, reflecting contractual increases in coal commodity costs and higher plant availability in 2006. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the South Central region for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $89 million, a reduction of $22 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The reduction was primarily due to lower major maintenance costs, which dropped by $12 million due to fewer planned outages at the regions coal plant in 2006 and lower insurance costs, which were $3 million less in 2006 due to lower premiums. 101 Table of Contents West Region 2007 compared to 2006 The following table provides selected financial information for the West region for the years ended December 31, 2007, and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 4 $ 75 (95 )% Capacity revenue 122 68 79 Risk management activities (3 ) N/A Other revenues 1 6 (83 ) Total operating revenues 127 146 (13 ) Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 5 80 (94 ) Depreciation and amortization 3 3 Other operating expenses 80 55 45 Operating Income $ 39 $ 8 388 MWh sold (in thousands) 1,246 1,901 (34 ) MWh generated (in thousands) 1,246 1,901 (34 ) Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 66.52 $ 61.54 8 Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 785 926 (15 ) CDDs 30 year rolling average 704 704 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 3,048 3,001 2 % HDDs 30 year rolling average 3,228 3,228 (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region.

The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. Operating Income Operating income increased by $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. Excluding the consolidation of WCPs results following the acquisition of Dynegys 50% interest on March 31, 2006, operating income increased by $24 million, due to: Capacity revenues increased by approximately $28 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, due to new tolling agreements at the regions Encina and Long Beach plants: Encina In January 2007, NRG signed a new tolling agreement for the regions Encina plant which contributed $15 million in capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. Long Beach On August 1, 2007, NRG successfully completed the repowering of a 260 MW natural gas fueled generating plant at its Long Beach generating facility, which contributed approximately $13 million in capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. 102 Table of Contents Cost of energy decreased by $76 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, due to the new tolling agreement entered into at the Encina plant in 2007, which required the counterparty to supply their own fuel. Under the previous arrangement in 2006, the plant supplied the fuel. This increase was offset by: Energy revenues decreased by approximately $72 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, primarily due to the tolling agreement at the Encina plant that has resulted in the receipt of fixed monthly capacity payment in return for the right to schedule and dispatch from the plant. The Encina tolling agreement replaced the RMR agreement under which the plant was called upon to generate revenues for such dispatch. OM expense increased by approximately $6 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, primarily due to increases in labor costs, major maintenance and auxiliary power. Development expenses increased by $4 million, reflecting RepoweringNRG initiatives at the regions El Segundo and Encina sites. Other revenues decreased ancillary service revenue of $3 million at the Encina plant due to the new tolling agreement that consigns ancillary service revenue to the counterparty in exchange for a fixed monthly capacity payment. 2006 compared to 2005 The following table provides selected financial information for the West region for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 75 $ 1 N/A Capacity revenue 68 N/A Risk management activities (3 ) N/A Other revenues 6 3 100 Total operating revenues 146 4 N/A Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 80 1 N/A Depreciation and amortization 3 1 200 Other operating expenses 55 8 588 Operating Income/(loss) $ 8 $ (6 ) N/A MWh sold (in thousands) 1,901 6 N/A MWh generated (in thousands) 1,901 6 N/A Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 61.54 $ 71.06 (13 ) Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 926 775 19 CDDs 30 year rolling average 704 704 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 3,001 2,842 6 % HDDs 30 year rolling average 3,228 3,228 (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region.

The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. 103 Table of Contents Operating Income For the year ended December 31, 2006, operating income for the West region was approximately $8 million, compared to a loss of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The 2006 gain in operating income was primarily due to NRGs acquisition of Dynegys 50% interest of WCP. The California high voltage power grid handled an all time record peak demand on July 24, 2006 at 50,270 MW, with the previous record peak demand of 45,431 MW set on July 20, 2005. Total Operating Revenues Total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $146 million, comprised of $75 million in energy revenues, of which 39% were contracted, and $68 million in capacity revenues. This compares to $4 million in operating revenues, comprised of $1 million in energy revenues and $3 million in other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. Cost of Energy Cost of energy for the year ended December 31, 2006, was approximately $80 million, consisting primarily of gas costs. For the year ended December 31, 2005, cost of energy for the West region was $1 million. Other Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the West region for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $55 million, or 38% of the regions total operating revenues. These costs included $32 million in operating and maintenance costs, of which $10 million was related to normal maintenance expenses associated with outage work. The region also incurred approximately $19 million in GA expenses, of which $4 million was related to development costs associated with the Companys RepoweringNRG program and approximately $3 million in corporate allocations. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of WCP, development spending, and NRG cost allocations. This compares to $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Position As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, NRGs liquidity was approximately $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, comprised of the following: As of December 31, 2007 2006 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,132 $ 795 Restricted cash 29 44 Total cash 1,161 839 Synthetic letter of credit availability 557 533 Revolver credit facility availability 997 855 Total liquidity $ 2,715 $ 2,227 Management believes that these amounts and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance operating and maintenance capital expenditures, to fund dividends to NRGs preferred shareholders and other liquidity commitments. Management continues to regularly monitor the companys ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity in a manner consistent with its intention to maintain a steady debt to capital ratio in the range of 45 60%. Credit Ratings Credit rating agencies rate a firms public debt securities. These ratings are utilized by the debt markets in evaluating a firms credit risk. Ratings influence the price paid to issue new debt securities by indicating to the 104 Table of Contents market the Companys ability to pay principal, interest, and preferred dividends. Rating agencies evaluate a firms industry, cash flow, leverage, liquidity, and hedge profile, among other factors, in their credit analysis of a firms credit risk. The following table summarizes the credit ratings for NRG Energy, Inc., its term loan and its senior notes as of December 31, 2007: SP Moodys Fitch NRG Energy, Inc. B+ Ba3 B 7.375% Senior Notes, due 2016, 2017 B B1 B+ 7.25% Senior Notes due 2014 B B1 B+ Term Loan BB Ba1 BB SOURCES OF FUNDS The principal sources of liquidity for NRGs future operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived from new and existing financing arrangements, asset sales, existing cash on hand and cash flows from operations. Financing Arrangements Senior Credit Facility Amendment On June 8, 2007, NRG completed a $4.4 billion refinancing of the Companys then existing Senior Credit Facility which comprised a senior first priority secured term loan, or the Term Loan Facility, a $1.0 billion senior first priority secured revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, and a senior first priority secured synthetic letter of credit facility, or the Letter of Credit Facility. The refinancing resulted in a 0.25% reduction on the spread that the Company pays on its Term B loan and Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility, a $200 million reduction in the Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility to $1.3 billion, and various amendments to provide improved flexibility, efficiency for returning capital to shareholders, asset repowering and investment opportunities. The pricing on the Companys Term B loan and Synthetic Letters of Credit Facility was also subject to further reductions upon the achievement of certain financial ratios. The refinancing resulted in a charge of approximately $35 million to the Companys results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was primarily related to the write off of previously deferred financing costs. On August 6, 2007, NRG entered into an agreement with BNP Paribas, or BNP, whereby BNP has agreed to be an issuing bank under the revolver portion of the Companys Senior Credit Facility. BNP has agreed to issue up to $350 million in letters of credit under the revolver. In addition, on January 30, 2008, NRG entered into an agreement with Bank of America, whereby Bank of America has also agreed to be an issuing bank under the revolver portion of the Companys Senior Credit Facility. Bank of America has agreed to issue up to $250 million of letter of credit under the revolver. This increases the amount of unfunded letters of credit the Company can issue under its Revolving Credit Facility to $900 million. In addition, NRG is permitted to issue additional letters of credit of up to $100 million under the Senior Credit Facility through other financial institutions. On December 31, 2007, the Company used cash on hand to prepay, without penalty, $300 million of its Term B loan under the Senior Credit Facility. With this prepayment, the Company has achieved a 3.5:1 threshold for its corporate leverage ratio as defined by its credit agreement, which would result in a 0.25% reduction in the interest rate on both its Term loan B and Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility which is expected to result in approximately $8 million in pre tax interest savings during 2008. The prepayment will be credited against the Companys mandatory annual prepayment which is required in March 2008 under the Senior Credit Facility. Beginning 2008, NRG must offer a portion of its excess cash flow (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility) to its first lien lenders under the Term B loan. The percentage of excess cash flow offered to these lenders is dependent upon the Companys consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility) at the end of the preceding year. Of the amount the Company is required to offer, the first lien lenders must accept 50% while the remaining 50% may either be accepted or rejected at the lenders option. 105 Table of Contents Based on current credit market conditions the Company expects that its lenders will accept in full the mandatory offer required in March 2008, and, as such, the Company has reclassified approximately $146 million of Term Loan B maturity from a non current to a current liability as of December 31, 2007. Holdco Credit Facility During 2007, the Company initiated a capital allocation strategy that contemplated NRG becoming a wholly owned operating subsidiary of a newly created holding company, NRG Holdings, Inc. or Holdco, with the stockholders of NRG becoming stockholders of Holdco. On June 8, 2007, NRG executed a Holdco Credit Facility, a delayed draw credit facility that expired December 28, 2007, that provided for the funding of $1 billion in term loan financing to Holdco which was intended for Holdco to make a capital contribution to NRG in the amount of $1 billion, to be used to prepay a portion of NRGs existing Term B loan. As part of the commitment, NRG agreed to pay a fee equal to 0.5% of the facility for the first 180 days and 0.75% thereafter. In November 2007, NRG exercised its right to provide its Senior Note holders with a conditional change of control notice, and related offer to purchase the Companys Senior Notes at 101% of par, prior to the actual formation of the Holdco structure. Concurrently, NRG also sought consent from its Senior Note holders to either waive the change of control or permit additional restricted payments under the indentures. In December 2007, the conditional tender offers and concurrent consent solicitations expired with no tendered Senior Notes accepted for payment and without receipt of the requisite consents to amend the indentures for the Senior Notes. Consequently, the Company decided not to move forward and form the Holdco structure. First and Second Lien Structure NRG has granted first and second priority liens to certain counterparties on substantially all of the Companys assets in the United States in order to secure certain obligations, which are primarily long term in nature under certain power sale agreements and related contracts. NRG uses the first or second lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under these agreements. Within the first and second lien structure, the Company can hedge up to 80% of its baseload capacity and 10% of its non baseload assets with these counterparties. As part of NRGs amended and restated credit agreement signed June 8, 2007, the Company obtained the ability to move its current second lien counterparty exposure to the first lien, on a pari passu basis with the Companys existing first lien lenders. In exchange for moving some second lien holders to a pari passu basis with the Companys first lien lenders, the counterparties agreed to relinquish letters of credit issued by NRG which they held as a part of their collateral package. On October 30, 2007, NRG successfully moved certain second lien holders to a pari passu basis with the Companys first lien lenders effectively releasing $557 million of letters of credit. With the movement to the first lien structure, the Company has significantly reduced its outstanding letter of credit exposure and thereby increased its liquidity. As of December 31, 2007, and February 1, 2008, the net discounted exposure on the agreements and hedges that were subject to the first and second lien structure were approximately $425 million and $340 million, respectively. In addition, on February 7, 2008, the Company moved an additional counterparty to the first lien position that resulted in an additional return of approximately $65 million in letters of credit. The following table summarizes the amount of MWs hedged against the Companys baseload assets and as a percentage relative to the Companys forecasted baseload capacity under the first and second lien structure as of February 1, 2008: Equivalent Net Sales Secured by First and Second Lien Structure(a) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 In MW(b) 3,283 3,811 3,050 3,264 572 As a percentage of total forecasted baseload capacity 57 % 55 % 45 % 48 % 9 % (a) Equivalent Net Sales include natural gas swaps converted using a weighted average heat rate by region. (b) 2008 MW value consists of March through December positions only. 106 Table of Contents Common Stock Finance I Debt Extension On February 27, 2008, the Company entered into an arrangement with Credit Suisse that allows the Company, at the Companys option and subject to customary closing conditions, to extend the $220 million notes and preferred interest maturities of CSF I from October 2008 to June 2010. In addition, the previous settlement date for any share price appreciation beyond a 20% compound annual growth rate since the original date of purchase by CSF I, may be extended 30 days to early December 2008. As part of this extension arrangement, the Company intends to contribute to CSF I additional collateral in the form of treasury shares to maintain a blended interest rate of CSF I facility of approximately 7.5%. The Company expects to implement this extension arrangement by March 17, 2008. Asset Sales ITISA On December 18, 2007, NRG entered into a sale and purchase agreement to sell its 100% interest in Tosli, which holds all NRGs interest in ITISA, to Brookfield Power Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management Inc., a Canadian asset management company, focused on property, power and infrastructure assets, for a purchase price of approximately $288 million, plus the assumption of approximately $60 million in debt, subject to purchase price adjustments, the receipt of regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. NRG anticipates completion of the sale transaction during first half of 2008. As discussed in Note 3, Discontinued Operations, Business Acquisitions and Dispositions, the activities of Tosli and ITISA have been classified as discontinued operations. USES OF FUNDS The Companys requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (1) commercial operations activities; (2) capital expenditures including RepoweringNRG project deposits; (3) corporate financial transactions; and (4) debt service obligations. Commercial Operations NRGs commercial operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) initial collateral required to establish trading relationships; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (i.e., buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); and (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions. As of December 31, 2007, commercial operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $85 million, and $556 million outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its economic hedging activities. Future liquidity requirements may change based on the Companys hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on NRGs credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness. Capital Expenditures The Companys capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased by approximately $260 million, to $481 million, primarily due to expenditures on RepoweringNRG projects. The following table 107 Table of Contents summarizes the Companys capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2007, and estimated capital expenditures for 2008: Maintenance Environmental Repowering Total (In millions) Northeast $ 28 $ 71 $ 7 $ 106 Texas 143 2 45 190 South Central 29 1 30 West 4 76 80 Wind 69 69 Other 6 6 Total $ 210 $ 74 $ 197 $ 481 Estimated capital expenditures for 2008 $ 234 $ 359 $ 603 $ 1,196 Repowering capital expenditures RepoweringNRG project capital expenditures consisted of approximately $76 million for the repowered Long Beach generating station and $67 million in deposits for wind turbines related to certain wind farms under development. In addition, the Companys RepoweringNRG capital expenditures included $7 million for the Cos Cob facility and $45 million for Cedar Bayou Unit 4. Major maintenance and environmental capital expenditures In 2007, the Company initiated a baghouse project at the Huntley and Dunkirk plants which increased capital expenditures by approximately $71 million. Other capital expenditures included $60 million for STP fuel and maintenance, rotor work of $18 million for the W.A. Parish facility and $7 million related to the Limestone unit 2 facility, $5 million for Indian River unit 4 reheater, Oswego and Arthur Kill spare transformers of $4 million, LaGen Creole Station line rebuild of $4 million and Huntley Unit 67 Boiler replacement of $3 million. The Companys estimated repowering capital expenditures for 2008 primarily consists of approximately $327 million related to wind farm projects and approximately $172 million related to STP nuclear units 3 and 4. In addition, the Company expects to contribute approximately $83 million in equity towards its joint partnership with BP Alternative Energy North America for the construction of the Sherbino Wind Farm project in Texas. NRG anticipates funding these maintenance capital projects primarily with funds generated from operating activities. The Company is also pursuing funding for certain environmental expenditures in the Northeast through Solid Waste Disposal Bonds utilizing tax exempt financing, and expects to draw upon such funds during 2008 and 2009. Environmental Capital Expenditures Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated that environmental capital expenditures to be incurred from 2008 through 2012 to meet NRGs environmental commitments will be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion. These capital expenditures, in general, are related to installation of particulate, SO2, NOx, and mercury controls to comply with Clean Air Interstate Rule, or CAIR, the Clean Air Mercury Rule, or CAMR, and related state requirements as well as installation of Best Technology Available under the Phase II 316(b) rule. NRG continues to explore cost effective alternatives that can achieve desired results. The range reflects alternative strategies available with respect to the Companys Indian River plant. 108 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the upper end of the estimated range for major environmental capital expenditures for the referenced periods by region: Texas Northeast South Central Total (In millions) 2008 $ 3 $ 223 $ 133 $ 359 2009 5 192 211 408 2010 24 178 117 319 2011 28 112 53 193 2012 11 66 15 92 Total $ 71 $ 771 $ 529 $ 1,371 NRG plans to reduce the impact of a portion of the above environmental capital expenditures. NRG has the ability to monetize a portion of the Companys excess allowances over the 2008 through 2012 timeframe and still hold sufficient allowances to operate the fleet with proposed controls through at least 2020. Second, NRGs current contracts with the Companys rural electrical customers in the South Central region allow for recovery of a significant portion of the capital costs, along with a capital return incurred by complying with new laws, including interest over the asset life of the required expenditures. Actual recoveries will depend, among other things, on the duration of the contracts and the treatment of these expenditures. Share Repurchases For the year ended December 31, 2007, NRG repurchased 9,044,400 shares of the Companys common stock for approximately $353 million. Of these shares repurchased, 7,006,700 shares of NRG common stock for approximately $268 million were associated with Phase II of the Companys previously announced Capital Allocation Program, which was completed during the third quarter 2007. In December 2007, the Company initiated its 2008 Capital Allocation Program with the repurchase of 2,037,700 shares of NRG common stock for approximately $85 million. This was followed in January 2008 with the repurchase of 344,000 shares of NRG common stock for approximately $15 million. In February 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized an additional $200 million in common share repurchases that would raise the 2008 Capital Allocation Program to approximately $300 million. RepoweringNRG Project Deposits NRG has made non refundable deposits relating to RepoweringNRG initiatives totaling approximately $71 million primarily towards the procurement of wind turbines. The Company believes that these deposits are necessary for the timely and successful execution of these projects. The deposits are in support of expected deliveries of wind turbines and other equipment totaling approximately $409 million through 2009. Although NRG is committed to their successful implementation, the Company may decide not to take delivery of the equipment and thus terminate the projects. This would result in the Company expensing the deposits it already has made. On February 4, 2008, NRG through its wholly owned subsidiary, Padoma Wind Power LLC, had entered into a 50 50 joint venture with BP Alternative Energy North America Inc. to build the first phase of the Sherbino Wind Farm. The Sherbino I Wind Farm will be a 150 megawatt (MW) wind project, consisting of 50 Vestas 3 MW wind turbine generators, located approximately 40 miles east of Fort Stockton in Pecos County, Texas. NRG expects to contribute approximately $83 million in equity to the joint venture in 2008 and has posted a letter of credit in that amount. Preferred Stock Dividend Payments For the year ended December 31, 2007, NRG paid approximately $28.8 million, $16.8 million and $9.0 million in dividend payments to holders of the Companys 5.75%, 4% and 3.625% Preferred Stock. 109 Table of Contents Debt Service Obligations On December 31, 2007, the Company used cash on hand to prepay, without penalty, $300 million of its Term B loan under the Senior Credit Facility. With this prepayment, the Company has met a financial ratio by the end of 2007 that would result in a 0.25% reduction in the interest rate on both its Term B loan and Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility which is expected to result in approximately $8 million in pre tax interest savings during 2008. This prepayment will be credited against the Companys mandatory annual prepayment which is required in March 2008 under the Senior Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2007, NRG had approximately $4.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured high yield notes or Senior Notes and approximately $2.8 billion in principal amount outstanding under a Term B loan and had issued $743 million of letters of credit under the Companys $1.3 billion Letter of Credit Facility, leaving $557 million available for future issuances. Under the Companys $1.0 billion Revolving Facility, as of December 31, 2007, NRG had issued $3 million in letters of credit, leaving $997 million available for borrowings, of which approximately $647 million could be used to issue additional letters of credit. As of February 15, 2008, $518 million of undrawn letters of credit remain available under the funded letter of credit facility, $897 million of undrawn letters of credit remain available under the revolving credit facility, and NRG had no borrowings on the Companys revolving credit facility. In November 2007 NRG made a payment of $11 million on a revolving note after Merrill Lynch put the note back to the Company. Principal payments on debt and capital leases as of December 31, 2007 are due in the following periods: Subsidiary/Description 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In millions) Debt: 7.375% Notes due 2017 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1,100 $ 1,100 7.25% Notes due 2014 1,200 1,200 7.375% Notes due 2016 2,400 2,400 Term Loan, due 2013 184 31 32 31 31 2,506 2,815 CSF Non Recourse Obligations 190 143 333 NRG Energy Center Minneapolis, due 2013 and 2017 10 11 11 12 13 37 94 NRG Peaker Finance Co LLC 13 15 20 21 22 188 279 Subtotal Debt, Bonds and Notes 397 200 63 64 66 7,431 8,221 Capital Lease: Saale Energie GmbH, Schkopau 75 26 12 6 5 57 181 Total Payments and Capital Leases $ 472 $ 226 $ 75 $ 70 $ 71 $ 7,488 $ 8,402 Cash Flow Discussion NRG obtains cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets as well as proceeds from the issuance of notes and preferred stock. NRG uses these funds to finance operations, make interest payments, repurchase its common stock, service debt obligations, finance capital expenditures, and meet other cash and liquidity needs. 110 Table of Contents 2007 compared to 2006 The following table reflects the changes in cash flows for the comparative years; all cash flow categories include the cash flows from both continuing operations and discontinued operations: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,517 $ 408 $ 1,109 Net cash provided/(used) by investing activities (327 ) (4,176 ) 3,849 Net cash provided/(used) by financing activities (814 ) 4,053 (4,867 ) Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2007, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.1 billion compared to the same period in 2006. This was due to: Hedge Reset and derivative activity this increase was primarily due to the write off of power contracts of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006 and a corresponding $339 million reduction in contract amortization during 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of the Hedge Reset transaction. In addition, net income increased $226 million as a result of adjustments for derivative activity. Collateral deposits following an upward shift of the forward price curves, NRGs net collateral deposits in support of derivative contracts increased by $125 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to a decrease of $454 million during the same period in 2006, a difference of $579 million. As of December 31, 2007, NRG had net cash collateral deposit of $85 million. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2007, net cash used in investing activities was approximately $3.9 billion less than the same period in 2006. This reduction in investing activities was due to: Texas acquisition that occurred during the first quarter 2006. NRG acquired Texas Genco LLC for approximately $6.2 billion that included the issuance of common stock at a value of $1.7 billion and a net cash payment of approximately $4.3 billion; Capital expenditures NRGs capital expenditures increased by $260 million due to expenditures of approximately $197 million for RepoweringNRG projects, primarily related to $76 million for the Long Beach plant and $67 million in deposits for wind turbines. In addition, the Company initiated a baghouse project at the Huntley and Dunkirk plants which also increased capital expenditures by approximately $71 million. Discontinued Operations and Asset Sales In 2006 NRG received proceeds of $261 million from the sale of Flinders, Audrain, and Resource Recovery. The sale of the Companys Red Bluff and Chowchilla plants and equipment resulted in increased proceeds from asset sales by approximately $57 million for 2007. Net Cash Provided/(Used) in Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2007, net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately $4.9 billion compared to 2006, due to: During the first quarter 2006, NRG acquired Texas Genco LLC. As part of the acquisition, NRG refinanced the Companys outstanding debt as well as Texas Genco LLCs outstanding debt, and also issued new debt, preferred stock and common stock to fund the acquisition: Total debt repayments were $4.6 billion $1.9 billion of NRG debt and $2.7 billion of Texas Genco LLC debt. Total proceeds from debt issued were $7.2 billion $3.6 billion from unsecured notes and $3.6 billion from a senior secured facility, including a $1.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility, and a $1.5 billion Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility. 111 Table of Contents Total proceeds from stock issued of approximately $1.5 billion net proceeds of $986 million from issuing approximately 21 million shares of common stock and net proceeds of $486 million from issuing 2 million shares of the Companys 5.75% Preferred Stock. For the year ended December 31, 2007, NRG repurchased 9,049,400 shares of the Companys common stock for approximately $353 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, NRG repurchased 29,601,162 shares for $732 million. The Company also used cash on hand to repay, without penalty, $300 million of its Term B loan under the Senior Credit Facility. NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and FIN 48 Implications As of December 31, 2007, the Company had generated total domestic pretax book income of $860 million which fully utilized domestic NOL in the amount of $245 million. In addition, NRG has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $288 million, of which $72 million will expire starting in 2011 through 2016 and of which $216 million do not have an expiration date. In addition to these amounts, the Company has $683 million of tax effected unrecognized tax benefits which relate primarily to net operating losses for tax return purposes but have been classified as capital loss carryforwards for financial statements purposes and for which a full valuation allowance has been established. As a result of the Companys tax position, and based on current forecasts, future U.S. domestic income tax payments will be minimal through mid year 2009 as these unrecognized tax benefits will be utilized for tax return purposes. However, as the position remains uncertain, of the $683 million of tax effected unrecognized tax benefits, the Company has recorded a non current tax liability of $7 million and may accrue the remaining balance as an increase to non current liabilities until final resolution with the related taxing authority. On July 6, 2007, the German government passed the Tax Reform Act of 2008, which reduces the German statutory and resulting effective tax rates on earnings from approximately 36% to approximately 27% effective January 1, 2008. Due to this reduction in the statutory and resulting effective tax rate in 2007, NRG recognized a $29 million tax benefit and as of December 31, 2007, NRG had a German net deferred tax liability of approximately $84 million which includes the impact of this tax rate change. Off Balance Sheet Instruments and Other Contractual Arrangements Obligations under Certain Guarantee Contracts NRG and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include financial and performance guarantees, stand by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. Retained or Contingent Interests NRG does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. Derivative Instrument obligations On August 11, 2005, NRG issued 3.625% Preferred Stock that includes a feature which is considered an embedded derivative per SFAS 133. Although it is considered an embedded derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting as it is excluded from the scope pursuant to paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133. As of December 31, 2007, based on the Companys stock price, the redemption value of this embedded derivative was approximately $151 million. On October 13, 2006, NRG through its unrestricted wholly owned subsidiaries NRG Common Stock Fund I and NRG Common Stock Fund II, issued notes and preferred interests for the repurchase of NRGs common stock. Included in the agreement is a feature which is considered an embedded derivative per SFAS 133. Although it is considered a derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting as it is excluded from the scope pursuant to paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133. As of December 31, 2007, based on the Companys stock price, the redemption value of this embedded derivative was approximately $87 million. 112 Table of Contents Obligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity Variable interest in Equity investments As of December 31, 2007, NRG had not entered into any financing structure that was designed to be off balance sheet that would create liquidity, financing or incremental market risk or credit risk to the Company. However, NRG has several investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy related entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. NRGs pro rata share of non recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $122 million as of December 31, 2007. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to NRG. Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility and Revolver Facility Under NRGs amended Senior Credit Facility which the company entered in to on June 8, 2007, the Company has a $1.3 billion synthetic Letter of Credit Facility which is secured by a $1.3 billion cash deposit at Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, the Issuing Bank. This deposit was funded using proceeds from the Term B loan investors who participated in the facility syndication. Under the Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility, NRG is allowed to issue letters of credit for general corporate purposes including posting collateral to support the Companys commercial operations activities. On August 6, 2007, NRG entered into an agreement with BNP Paribas, or BNP, whereby BNP has agreed to be an issuing bank under the revolver portion of the Companys Senior Credit Facility. BNP has agreed to issue up to $350 million of letters of credit. In addition, on January 30, 2008, NRG entered into an agreement with Bank of America, whereby Bank of America has also agreed to be an issuing bank under the revolver portion of the Companys Senior Credit Facility. Bank of America has agreed to issue up to $250 million of letters of credit under the revolver. This increases the amount of unfunded letters of credit the Company can issue under its Revolving Credit Facility to $900 million for ongoing working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions that are permitted under the Senior Credit Facility. In addition, NRG is permitted to issue additional letters of credit of up $100 million under the Senior Credit facility through other financial institutions. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had issued $743 million in letters of credit under the Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility. In addition, as of December 31, 2007, the Company had issued $3 million in letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility. A portion of these letters of credit supports non commercial letter of credit obligations. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NRG has a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to the Companys capital expenditure programs. The following tables summarize NRGs contractual obligations and guarantees. For an additional discussion, see Item 15 Note 11, Debt and Capital Leases, and Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

See Item 15 Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of commitments and contingencies that also include contractual obligations and commercial commitments that occurred during 2007. Derivative Instruments NRG may enter into long term power sales contracts, fuel purchase contracts and other energy related financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices, to hedge fuel requirements at generation facilities and protect fuel inventories. In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the Companys variable rate and fixed rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements. NRGs trading activities include contracts entered into to profit from market price changes as opposed to hedging an exposure, and are subject to limits in accordance with the Companys risk management policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings. These trading activities are a complement to NRGs energy marketing portfolio. The tables below disclose the activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; identify changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2007, based on whether fair values are determined by quoted market prices or more subjective means; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2007.

The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed. On an ongoing basis, NRG evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Companys estimates. Any effects on the Companys business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. NRGs significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Companys financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting Policy Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application Derivative Financial Instruments Assumptions used in valuation techniques Assumptions used in forecasting generation Market maturity and economic conditions Contract interpretation Market conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commitments Regulatory and political environments and requirements Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets Ability of tax authority decisions to withstand legal challenges or appeals Anticipated future decisions of tax authorities Application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions Ability to utilize tax benefits through carrybacks to prior periods and carryforwards to future periods Impairment of Long Lived Assets Recoverability of investment through future operations Regulatory and political environments and requirements Estimated useful lives of assets Environmental obligations and operational limitations 115 Table of Contents Accounting Policy Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application Estimates of future cash flows Estimates of fair value (fresh start) Judgment about triggering events Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Estimated useful lives for finite lived intangible assets Judgment about impairment triggering events Estimates of reporting units fair value Fair value estimate of certain power sales and fuel contracts using forward pricing curves as of the closing date over the life of each contract Contingencies Estimated financial impact of event(s) Judgment about likelihood of event(s) occurring Derivative Financial Instruments The Company follows the guidance of SFAS 133, to account for derivative financial instruments. SFAS 133 requires the Company to mark to market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet, and recognize changes in the fair value of non hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. In certain cases, NRG may apply hedge accounting to the Companys derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure, (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives instruments accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item, or deferred and recorded as a component of OCI, and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur. For purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, NRG uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes. When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models to determine the fair value. These internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy based on the specific market in which the energy is being sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. In order to qualify derivatives instruments for hedged transactions, NRG estimates the forecasted generation occurring within a specified time period. Judgments related to the probability of forecasted generation occurring are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation, and historical physical delivery on similar contracts. The probability that hedged forecasted generation will occur by the end of a specified time period could change the results of operations by requiring amounts currently classified in OCI to be reclassified into earnings, creating increased variability in our earnings. These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates. Certain derivative financial instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered Normal Purchase and Normal Sales, or NPNS. The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that NRG has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation, and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment, and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings. Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets As of December 31, 2007, NRG had a valuation allowance of approximately $539 million. This amount is comprised of U.S. domestic capital loss carryforwards and non depreciable property of approximately $458 million, 116 Table of Contents foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $80 million and foreign capital loss carryforwards of approximately $1 million. In assessing the recoverability of NRGs deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon projected capital gains and available tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2007, NRG had fully utilized $245 million of cumulative U.S. federal and state net operating loss for financial reporting purposes. The utilization of the Companys NOLs depends on several factors, such as NRGs ability to utilize tax benefits through carryforwards to future periods, the application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions. NRG continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions. Considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. NRG is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including major operations located in Germany, Australia, and Brazil. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2002. With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2003. The Companys significant foreign operations are also no longer subject to examination by local jurisdictions for years prior to 2000. Evaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other Than Temporary Decline in Value In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, or SFAS 144, NRG evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are: Significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset; Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition; Adverse business climate; Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset, Current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and Change in the Companys intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs, and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Companys estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material. For assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value under SFAS 144, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held for sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. NRG considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence of such information, the Company may consider prices of similar assets, consult with brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. NRG will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability weights a range of possible outcomes. The use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as 117 Table of Contents previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in the Companys estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material. NRG is also required to evaluate its equity method and cost method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired. Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, or APB18, provides the accounting requirements for these investments. The standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under APB 18 is whether the value is considered an other than a temporary decline in value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under APB 18 involves the same uncertainties as described for long lived assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with SFAS 144. Similarly, the estimates that NRG makes with respect to its equity and cost method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which the Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of SFAS 144, NRG would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other than temporary decline in value under APB 18. For the year ended December 31, 2007, there was a reduction of $11 million in income from continuing operation due to an impairment of an investment in commercial paper which has been subsequently reclassified from cash equivalents to non current assets. The Company recorded this impairment as a reduction to interest income. For the year ended 2006, there was no reduction in income from continuing operation due to any impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2005, income from continuing operations was reduced by $6 million due to an impairment. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets As part of the acquisition of Texas Genco LLC, NRG recorded intangible assets and goodwill. The Company applied SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, or SFAS 141, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, or SFAS 142, to account for these intangibles. Under these standards, the Company amortizes all finite lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. However, goodwill and all intangible assets not subject to amortization will be tested for impairments whenever an event occurs that indicates that an impairment may have occurred, or at a minimum, on an annual basis. Where necessary, the Companys goodwill and or intangible asset with indefinite lives will be impaired at that time. In connection with the Texas Genco acquisition, the Company recognized the estimated fair value of certain power sale contracts and fuel contracts acquired. NRG estimated their fair value using forward pricing curves as of the closing date of the acquisition over the life of each contract. These contracts had net negative fair values at the closing date of the acquisition and were reflected as assumed contracts in the consolidated balance sheets. Assumed contracts are amortized to revenues and fuel expense as applicable based on the estimated realization of the fair value established on the closing date over the contractual lives. Contingencies NRG records a loss contingency when management determines it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Developments See Item 15 Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk NRG is exposed to several market risks in the Companys normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with the Companys merchant power generation or 118 Table of Contents with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transaction. The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk and currency exchange risk. In order to manage these risks the Company uses various fixed price forward purchase and sales contracts, futures and option contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps and options traded in the over the counter financial markets to: Manage and hedge fixed price purchase and sales commitments; Manage and hedge exposure to variable rate debt obligations; Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices; and Hedge fuel requirements for the Companys generating facilities. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices, volatility in commodities, and correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal and oil. A number of factors influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products. These factors include: Seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand; Extreme peak demands due to weather conditions; Available supply resources; Transportation availability and reliability within and between regions; and Changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations. As part of NRGs overall portfolio, NRG manages the commodity price risk of the Companys merchant generation operations by entering into various derivative or non derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of electricity and purchases of fuel. These instruments include forward purchase and sale contracts, futures and option contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps and options traded in the over the counter financial markets. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon managements assessment of market, weather, operation and other factors. While some of the contracts the Company uses to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources, other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices, contract quantities, or both. NRG uses the Companys best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts held and sold. These estimates consider various factors, including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit exposure. However, it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording mark to market derivative instrument valuation, and such variations could be material. NRG measures the sensitivity of the Companys portfolio to potential changes in market prices using Value at Risk, or VAR. VAR is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. Currently, the company estimates VAR using a Monte Carlo simulation based methodology. NRGs total portfolio includes mark to market and non mark to market energy assets and liabilities. NRG uses a diversified VAR model to calculate an estimate of the potential loss in the fair value of the Companys energy assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, load obligations, and bilateral physical and financial transactions. The key assumptions for the Companys diversified model include: (1) a lognormal distribution of prices, (2) one day holding period, (3) a 95% confidence interval, (4) a rolling 36 month forward looking period, and (5) market implied volatilities and historical price correlations. As of December 31, 2007, the VAR for NRGs commodity portfolio, including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions calculated using the diversified VAR model was $64 million. 119 Table of Contents The following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VAR for NRG for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: VAR In millions As of December 31, 2007(b) $ 64 Average 28 Maximum 64 Minimum 14 As of December 31, 2006 $ 18 Average(a) 39 Maximum(a) 67 Minimum(a) 17 (a) Includes Texas region portfolio beginning the third quarter 2006. (b) Prior to December 4, 2007, NRGs VAR measurement was based on a rolling 24 month forward looking period Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as VAR, the evolving nature of the competitive markets for electricity and related derivatives, and the seasonality of changes in market prices, the VAR calculation may not capture the full extent of commodity price exposure. As a result, actual changes in the fair value of mark to market energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated VAR, and such changes could have a material impact on the Companys financial results. In order to provide additional information for comparative purposes to NRGs peers, the Company also uses VAR to estimate the potential loss of derivative financial instruments that are subject to mark to market accounting. These derivative instruments include transactions that were entered into for both asset management and trading purposes. The VAR for the derivative financial instruments calculated using the diversified VAR model as of December 31, 2007, for the entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset management and trading was approximately $17 million. Interest Rate Risk NRG is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through the Companys issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument. NRGs risk management policies allow the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations. In January 2006, the Company entered into a series of new interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps became effective on February 15, 2006, and are intended to hedge the risk associated with floating interest rates. For each of the interest rate swaps, NRG pays its counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest payment on a predetermined notional value, and NRG receives the equivalent of a floating interest payment based on a 3 month LIBOR rate calculated on the same notional value. All interest rate swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made quarterly, and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period. While the notional value of each of the swaps does not vary over time, the swaps are designed to mature sequentially. The total notional amount of these swaps as of December 31, 2007 was $2.03 billion. The notional amounts and maturities of each tranche of these swaps are as follows: Period of Swap Notional Value Maturity 2 year $ 140 million March 31, 2008 3 year $ 150 million March 31, 2009 4 year $ 190 million March 31, 2010 5 year $ 1.55 billion March 31, 2011 As of December 31, 2007, the Company had various interest rate swap agreements, including those listed above, with notional amounts totaling approximately $2.7 billion. If the swaps had been discontinued on December 31, 2007, the Company would have owed the counter parties approximately $69 million. Based on 120 Table of Contents the investment grade rating of the counter parties, NRG believes its exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by counterparties to its hedge contracts to be insignificant. NRG has both long and short term debt instruments that subject the Company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2007, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a $16 million change in interest expense on a rolling twelve month basis. As of December 31, 2007, the Companys long term debt fair value was $8.1 billion and the carrying amount was $8.4 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Companys long term debt by $471 million. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of NRGs activities and in the management of the Companys assets and liabilities. NRGs liquidity management framework is intended to maximize liquidity access and minimize funding costs. Through active liquidity management, the Company seeks to preserve stable, reliable and cost effective sources of funding. This enables the Company to replace maturing obligations when due and fund assets at appropriate maturities and rates. To accomplish this task, management uses a variety of liquidity risk measures that take into consideration market conditions, prevailing interest rates, liquidity needs, and the desired maturity profile of liabilities. Based on a sensitivity analysis, a $1 per MWh increase or decrease in electricity prices across the term of the marginable contracts would cause a change in margin collateral outstanding of approximately $15 million as of December 31, 2007. This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated based on portfolio composition and margin related contract provisions as of December 31, 2007. Credit Risk Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non performance or non payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages the credit risk of NRG and its subsidiaries through credit policies that include (i) an established credit approval process, (ii) a daily monitoring of counter party credit limits, (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, credit derivatives or prepayment arrangements, (iv) the use of payment netting agreements, and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. As of December 31, 2007, NRG held net collateral of approximately $147 million from counterparties. A portion of NRGs credit risk is related to transactions that are recorded in the Companys consolidated Balance Sheets. These transactions primarily consist of open positions from the Companys marketing and risk management operation that are accounted for using mark to market accounting, as well as amounts owed by counterparties for transactions that settled but have not yet been paid. The following table highlights the credit quality and the balance sheet settlement exposures related to these activities as of December 31, 2007: Exposure Before Net Credit Exposure Collateral Collateral Exposure (In millions, except ratios) Investment grade $ 1,446 $ 464 $ 982 Non investment grade 39 9 30 Not rated 171 11 160 Total $ 1,656 $ 484 $ 1,172 Investment grade 87 % 96 % 84 % Non investment grade 2 % 2 % 3 % Not rated 10 % 2 % 14 % 121 Table of Contents Additionally, the Company has concentrations of suppliers and customers among coal suppliers, electric utilities, energy marketing and trading companies, and regional transmission operators. These concentrations of counterparties may impact NRGs overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory and other conditions. NRGs exposure to significant counterparties greater than 10% of the net exposure of approximately $1.2 billion, was $923 million as of December 31, 2007. NRG does not anticipate any material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any of NRGs counterparties. Currency Exchange Risk NRG may be subject to foreign currency risk as a result of the Company entering into purchase commitments with foreign vendors for the purchase of major equipment associated with RepoweringNRG initiatives. To reduce the risks to such foreign currency exposure, the Company may enter into transactions to hedge its foreign currency exposure using currency options and forward contracts. At December 31, 2007, no foreign currency options and forward contracts were outstanding. As a result of the Companys limited foreign currency exposure to date, the effect of foreign currency fluctuations has not been material to the Companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The effects of a hypothetical simultaneous 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar from year end 2007 levels against all other currencies of countries in which the Company has continuing operations would result in an immaterial impact to NRGs consolidated statements of operations. However, NRGs consolidated financial position would also have been negatively affected by approximately $55 million, due to currency translation adjustments recorded in OCI.
