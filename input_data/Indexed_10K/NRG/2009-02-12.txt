Executive Summary Overview NRG is a wholesale power generation company with a significant presence in major competitive power markets in the United States. NRG is engaged in the ownership, development, construction and operation of power generation facilities, the transacting in and trading of fuel and transportation services, and the trading of energy, capacity and related products in the regional markets in the United States and select international markets where its generating assets are located. As of December 31, 2008, NRG had a total global portfolio of 189 active operating fossil fuel and nuclear generation units, at 48 power generation plants, with an aggregate generation capacity of approximately 24,005 MW, and approximately 550 MW under construction which includes partners interests of 275 MW. In addition, NRG has ownership interests in two wind farms representing an aggregate generation capacity of 270 MW, which includes partner interests of 75 MW. Within the US, NRG has one of the largest and most diversified power generation portfolios in terms of geography, fuel type and dispatch levels, with approximately 22,925 MW of fossil fuel and nuclear generation capacity in 177 active generating units at 43 plants and ownership interests in two wind farms representing 195 MW of wind generation capacity. These power generation facilities are primarily located in Texas (approximately 11,010 MW, including the 195 MW from the two wind farms), the Northeast (approximately 7,020 MW), South Central (approximately 2,845 MW), and West (approximately 2,130 MW) regions of the US, and approximately 115 MW of additional generation capacity from the Companys thermal assets. 69 Table of Contents NRGs principal domestic power plants consist of a mix of natural gas , coal , oil fired, nuclear and wind facilities, representing approximately 45%, 33%, 16%, 5% and 1% of the Companys total domestic generation capacity, respectively. In addition, 15% of NRGs domestic generating facilities have dual or multiple fuel capacity, which allows plants to dispatch with the lowest cost fuel option. NRGs domestic generation facilities consist of intermittent, baseload, intermediate and peaking power generation facilities, the ranking of which is referred to as Merit Order, and include thermal energy production plants. The sale of capacity and power from baseload generation facilities accounts for the majority of the Companys revenues and provides a stable source of cash flow. In addition, NRGs generation portfolio provides the Company with opportunities to capture additional revenues by selling power during periods of peak demand, offering capacity or similar products to retail electric providers and others, and providing ancillary services to support system reliability. NRGs Business Strategy NRGs business strategy is designed to enhance the Companys position as a leading wholesale power generation company in the US. NRG will continue to utilize its asset base as a platform for growth and development and as a source of cash flow generation which can be used for the return of capital to debt and equity holders. The Companys strategy is focused on: (i) top decile operating performance of its existing operating assets and enhanced operating performance of the Companys commercial operations and hedging program; (ii) repowering of power generation assets at existing sites and development of new power generation projects; and (iii) investment in energy related new businesses and new technologies where such investments create low to no carbon. This strategy is supported by the Companys five major initiatives (FORNRG, RepoweringNRG, econrg, Future NRG and NRG Global Giving) which are designed to enhance the Companys competitive advantages in these strategic areas and allow the Company to surmount the challenges faced by the power industry in the coming years. This strategy is being implemented by focusing on the following principles: Operational Performance The Company is focused on increasing value from its existing assets. Through the FORNRG initiative, NRG will continue to focus on extracting value from its portfolio by improving plant performance, reducing costs and harnessing the Companys advantages of scale in the procurement of fuels and other commodities, parts and services, and in doing so improving the Companys return on invested capital, or ROIC. FORNRG is a companywide effort designed to increase ROIC through operational performance improvements to the Companys asset fleet, along with a range of initiatives at plants and at corporate offices to reduce costs, or in some cases, monetize or reduce excess working capital and other assets. The FORNRG accomplishments include both recurring and one time improvements measured from a prior base year. For plant operations, the program measures cumulative current year benefits using current gross margins multiplied by the change in baseline levels of certain key performance indicators. The plant performance benefits include both positive and negative results for plant reliability, capacity, heat rate and station service. In addition to the FORNRG initiative, the Company seeks to maximize profitability and manage cash flow volatility through the Companys commercial operations strategy. The Company will continue to execute asset based risk management, hedging, marketing and trading strategies within well defined risk and liquidity guidelines in order to manage the value of the Companys physical and contractual assets. The Companys marketing and hedging philosophy is centered on generating stable returns from its portfolio of baseload power generation assets while preserving an ability to capitalize on strong spot market conditions and to capture the extrinsic value of the Companys intermediate and peaking facilities and portions of its baseload fleet. NRG believes that it can successfully execute this strategy by leveraging its (i) expertise in marketing power and ancillary services, (ii) its knowledge of markets, (iii) its balanced financial structure and (iv) its diverse portfolio of power generation assets. Finally, NRG remains focused on cash flow and maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity, debt and equity in order to ensure continued access to capital for investment, to enhance risk adjusted returns and to provide flexibility in executing NRGs business strategy during business downturns, including a regular return of capital to its shareholders. NRG will continue to focus on maintaining operational and financial controls designed to ensure that the Companys financial position remains strong. 70 Table of Contents Development NRG is favorably positioned to pursue growth opportunities through expansion of its existing generating capacity and development of new generating capacity at its existing facilities. NRG intends to invest in its existing assets through plant improvements, repowerings, brownfield development and site expansions to meet anticipated requirements for additional capacity in NRGs core markets. Through the RepoweringNRG initiative, NRG will continue to develop, construct and operate new and enhanced power generation facilities at its existing sites, with an emphasis on new baseload capacity that is supported by long term power sales agreements and financed with limited or non recourse project financing. RepoweringNRG is a comprehensive portfolio redevelopment program designed to develop, construct and operate new multi fuel, multi technology, highly efficient and environmentally responsible generation capacity over the next decade. Through this initiative, the Company anticipates retiring certain existing units and adding new generation to meet growing demand in the Companys core markets, with an emphasis on new capacity that is expected to be supported by long term hedging programs, including PPAs, and financed with limited or non recourse project financing. NRG expects that these efforts will provide one or more of the following benefits: improved heat rates; lower delivered costs; expanded electricity production capability; an improved ability to dispatch economically across the regional general portfolio; increased technological and fuel diversity; and reduced environmental impacts, including facilities that either have near zero greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions or can be equipped to capture and sequester GHG emissions. New Businesses and New Technology NRG is focused on the development and investment in energy related new businesses and new technologies where the benefits of such investments represent significant commercial opportunities and create a comparative advantage for the Company, including low or no GHG emitting energy generating sources, such as nuclear, wind, solar thermal, photovoltaic, clean coal and gas, and the employment of post combustion carbon capture technologies. In 2008, the Company began to increase its focus on ways to invest in or support the development of new energy related businesses and technologies that could advance its multi fuel, multi technology growth strategy and look for new ways to reduce carbon emissions from its overall fleet, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Furthermore, the Company intends to capitalize on the high growth opportunities presented by government mandated renewable portfolio standards, tax incentives and loan guaranties for renewable energy projects and new technologies and expected future carbon regulation. A primary focus of this strategy is supported by the econrg initiative whereby NRG is pursuing investments in new generating facilities and technologies that will be highly efficient and will employ no and low carbon technologies to limit CO2 emissions and other air emissions. econrg represents NRGs commitment to environmentally responsible power generation by addressing the challenges of climate change, clean air and water, and conservation of our natural resources while taking advantage of business opportunities that may inure to NRG as a result of our demonstration and deployment of green technologies. Within NRG, econrg builds upon a foundation in environmental compliance and embraces environmental initiatives for the benefit of our communities, employees and shareholders, such as encouraging investment in new environmental technologies, pursuing activities that preserve and protect the environment and encouraging changes in the daily lives of the Companys employees. Company Wide Initiatives In addition, the Companys overall strategy is also supported by Future NRG and NRG Global Giving initiatives. Future NRG is the Companys workforce planning and development initiative and represents NRGs strong commitment to planning for future staffing requirements to meet the on going needs of the Companys current operations in addition to the Companys RepoweringNRG initiatives. Future NRG encompasses analyzing the demographics, skill set and size of the Companys workforce in addition to the organizational structure with a focus on succession planning, training, development, staffing and recruiting needs. Included under the Future NRG umbrella is NRG University, which provides leadership, managerial, supervisory and technical training programs and individual skill development courses. NRG Global Giving is designed to enhance respect for the community, which is one of NRGs core values. Our Global Giving Program invests NRGs resources to strengthen the communities where we do business and seeks to make community investments in four focus areas: community and economic development, education, environment and human welfare. Finally, NRG will continue to pursue selective acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures to enhance its asset mix and competitive position in the Companys core markets. NRG intends to concentrate on opportunities that present attractive risk adjusted returns. NRG will also opportunistically pursue other strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions or divestitures. 71 Table of Contents Business Environment General Industry Trends impacting the power industry include (i) the continued constrained credit and capital markets along with deepening recessionary environment, and (ii) increased regulatory and political scrutiny. The industry dynamics and external influences that will affect the Company and the power generation industry in 2009 and for the medium term include: Financial Credit Market Availability and Domestic Recession A sharp economic downturn in the US and overseas during 2008 was prompted by a combination of factors: tight credit markets, speculation and fear regarding the health of the US and global financial systems, and weaker economic activity including a global economic recession. Power generation companies are capital intensive and, as such, rely on the credit markets for liquidity and for the financing of power generation investments. In addition, economic recessions historically result in lower power demand, power prices, and fuel prices. NRG has a diversified liquidity program, with $3.4 billion in total liquidity, excluding funds deposited by counterparties, and a first and second lien structure that enables significant strategic hedging while reducing requirements for the posting of cash or letters of credit as collateral. NRG expects to continue to manage commodity price volatility through its strategic hedging program, under which the Company expects to hedge revenues and fuel costs. This program should provide the Company with the flexibility to enter into hedges opportunistically, such as when gas prices are increasing, while at the same time protecting NRG against longer term volatility in the commodity markets. The Company believes that an economic recession is unlikely to have material impact on the Companys cash generation in the near term due to the hedged position of its portfolio. NRG transacts with a diversified pool of counterparties and actively manages our exposure to any single counterparty. See also Part II, Item 7 Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Part II, Item 7a Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a further discussion. Consolidation Over the long term, industry consolidation is expected to occur, with mergers and acquisitions activity in the power generation sector likely to involve utility merchant or merchant merchant combinations. There may also be interest by foreign power companies, particularly European utilities, in the American power generation sector. Climate Change There is a marked shift towards federal action to address climate change under the Obama administration, which has made clear its intention to make climate change policy a priority for the US through legislation, regulation, and global leadership. President Obama reiterated this commitment in his inaugural address. Congressman Waxman, who sees aggressive action on climate change as a major priority, was elected chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and announced that a climate change bill would be delivered out of committee before Memorial Day. Regional efforts have gained momentum as well. The RGGI CO2 cap and trade program for electric generating units went into effect on January 1, 2009. California, the Western Climate Initiative, and the Midwest GHG Accord continue to develop market based programs in their respective jurisdictions. Since fossil fueled power plants, particularly coal fired plants, are a significant source of GHG emissions both in the US and globally, it is almost certain that future GHG legislative and regulatory actions will encompass power plants as well as other GHG emitting stationary sources. In 2008, in the course of producing approximately 80 million MWh of electricity, NRGs power plants emitted 68 million tonnes of CO2, of which 61 million tonnes were emitted in the US, 4 million tonnes in Germany, and 3 million tonnes in Australia. NRG emissions subject to RGGI were 12 million tonnes in 2008. Federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could have a material impact on the Companys financial performance. The actual impact on the Companys financial performance will depend on a number of factors, including the overall level of GHG reductions required under any such regulations, the degree to which offsets may be used for compliance and their price and availability, and the extent to which NRG would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market. Thereafter, the impact would depend on the level of success of the Companys multifold strategy, which includes (a) shaping public policy with the objective being constructive and effective federal GHG regulatory policy, and (b) pursuing its RepoweringNRG and econrg programs. The Companys multifold strategy is discussed in greater detail in Item 1, Business under Carbon Update. 72 Table of Contents Infrastructure Development In response to record peak power demand, tightening reserve margins, and volatile natural gas prices experienced in recent years, the power generation industry has added significant capacity for both transmission and generation. In addition to traditional gas fired capacity, much of the new generation would be from non fossil fuel sources, including nuclear and renewable sources. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created financial incentives for non traditional baseload generation, such as advance nuclear and clean coal technologies in order to reduce reliance on the more traditional pulverized coal technologies. During 2007, 18 gigawatts of previously announced pulverized coal generation projects were canceled due to increasing public and political concern regarding carbon emissions limiting the pace of development. During 2008, the credit market crisis severely constrained the industrys ability to finance power projects. Despite the challenges presented by financing availability and carbon legislation constraints, NRG believes the long term demand for power generation will continue to require new generation. Competition Wholesale power generation is a capital intensive, commodity driven business with numerous industry participants. NRG competes on the basis of the location of its plants and owning multiple plants in its regions, which increases the stability and reliability of its energy supply. Wholesale power generation is basically a local business that is currently highly fragmented relative to other commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies NRG competes against depending on the market. Weather Weather conditions in the different regions of the US influence the financial results of NRGs businesses. Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Companys results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas and oil are higher in the winter. However, all regions of North America typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG is typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once. Other Factors A number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for NRGs business. These factors include: seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand; extreme peak demands; available supply resources; transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions; location of NRGs generating facilities relative to the location of its load serving opportunities; procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations. These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in: weather conditions; market liquidity; capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems; 73 Table of Contents local transportation systems; and the nature and extent of electricity deregulation. Environmental Matters, Regulatory Matters and Legal Proceedings NRG discusses details of its other environmental matters in Item 15 Note 23, Environmental Matters, to its Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1, Business Environmental Matters, section. NRG discusses details of its regulatory matters in Item 15 Note 22, Regulatory Matters, to its Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1, Business Environmental Matters, section. NRG discusses details of its legal proceedings in Item 15 Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, to its Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of this information is about costs that may be material to the Companys financial results. Impact of inflation on NRGs results Unless discussed specifically in the relevant segment, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the impact of inflation and changing prices (due to changes in exchange rates) on NRGs revenues and income from continuing operations was immaterial. Capital Allocation Program NRGs capital allocation philosophy includes reinvestment in its core facilities, maintenance of prudent debt levels and interest coverage, the regular return of capital to shareholders and investment in repowering opportunities. Each of these components are described further as follows: Reinvestment in existing assets Opportunities to invest in the existing business, including maintenance and environmental capital expenditures that improve operational performance, ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and expansion projects. Management of debt levels The Company uses several metrics to measure the efficiency of its capital structure and debt balances, including the Companys targeted net debt to total capital ratio range of 45% to 60% and certain cash flow and interest coverage ratios. The Company intends in the normal course of business to continue to manage its debt levels towards the lower end of the range and may, from time to time, pay down its debt balances for a variety of reasons. Return of capital to shareholders The Companys debt instruments include restrictions on the amount of capital that can be returned to shareholders. The Company has in the past returned capital to shareholders while maintaining compliance with existing debt agreements and indentures. The Company expects to regularly return capital to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases, while exploring other prospects to increase its flexibility under restrictive debt covenants. Repowering, econrg and new build opportunities The Company intends to pursue repowering initiatives that enhance and diversify its portfolio and provide a targeted economic return to the Company. On October 30, 2008, the Company announced its 2009 Capital Allocation Plan to purchase an additional $300 million in common stock, subject to restrictions under the US securities laws. As part of the 2009 program, the Company will invest over $511 million in maintenance and environmental capital expenditures in the existing assets in 2009 and $256 million in investment in projects under RepoweringNRG that are currently under construction or for which there exists current obligations. Finally, in addition to scheduled debt amortization payment, in the first quarter 2009 the Company will offer its first lien lenders $197 million of its 2008 excess cash flow (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility). 74 Table of Contents Significant events during the year ended December 31, 2008 Results of Operations and Financial Condition Mark to market gains The Companys risk management activities recognized $414 million in mark to market gains driven by lower energy prices due to the downward trend in natural gas prices during the second half 2008. High price volatility in energy related commodities during 2008 drove the extreme volatility reported in NRG interim results of operations and consolidated balance sheets during the second and third quarters of 2008, due to the commodities impact on the fair value of our derivative contracts. Liquidity Position The Companys total liquidity rose $1.4 billion as the declining natural gas prices increased funds deposited by counterparties by $754 million. Cash balances grew by $362 million since the end of 2007 as $1.4 billion of cash provided by operating activities exceeded cash used for all phases of the Companys Capital Allocation Program, including $899 million of capital expenditures, $185 million in treasury share payments and a $214 million net debt reduction. Higher energy prices Energy revenues rose 6% as a result of strong operating performance at the power plants which allowed the Company to sell generation at higher energy prices especially in the second quarter 2008. Higher capacity revenues Capacity revenues rose $163 million as a result of a greater portion of Texas baseload contracts having a capacity component. Sale of ITISA On April 28, 2008, NRG completed the sale of its interest in a 156 MW hydroelectric power plant to Brookfield Renewable Power Inc. The Company recognized a $164 million after tax gain on the sale and received $300 million of cash proceeds. See Item 15 Note 3, Discontinued Operations, Business Acquisition and Dispositions, for a further discussion of the activities of ITISA that have been classified as discontinued operations. Reduced development costs As of January 1, 2008, the company began to capitalize the STP units 3 and 4 costs following the docketing of the COLA which resulted in decline of development costs of $52 million. Lower other income Interest income decreased by $25 million as the result of lower market interest rates on cash deposits. In addition, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $23 million to restructure distressed investments in commercial paper. Lower interest expense Interest expense decreased $69 million as the result of the interest savings on the $531 million debt repayments beginning December 2007 accompanied by a reduction of variable interest rates on long term debt. Other NINA In March 2008, NRG formed NINA, an NRG subsidiary focused on marketing, siting, developing, financing and investing in new advanced design nuclear projects in select markets across North America, including the planned STP units 3 and 4 that NRG is developing on a 50/50 basis with CPS Energy. TANE will serve as the prime contractor on all of NINAs projects, and has partnered with NRG on the NINA venture, and received a 12% equity ownership in NINA in exchange for a $300 million investment in NINA in six annual installments of $50 million, the first of which was received during 2008 and the last three of which are subject to certain conditions. On February 12, 2009, the Company announced that NINA completed negotiations for the EPC agreement with TANE to build the STP expansion. Concurrent with the execution of the EPC agreement, NINA will enter into a $500 million credit facility with Toshiba to finance the cost of long lead materials for STP 3 and 4. 75 Table of Contents Unsolicited Exelon Proposal On October 19, 2008, the Company received an unsolicited proposal from Exelon Corporation to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company and on November 12, 2008, Exelon announced a tender offer for all of the Companys outstanding common stock. On January 7, 2009, Exelon extended the tender offer to February 25, 2009, and indicated that further extensions may follow. NRGs Board of Directors, after carefully reviewing the proposal, unanimously concluded that the proposal was not in the best interests of the stockholders and has recommended that NRG stockholders not tender their shares. In addition, on January 30, 2009 Exelon announced a proposed slate of nine nominees for election to the NRG Board at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, together with a proposal to increase the number of NRG directors from 12 to 19. Sherbino Wind Farm On October 22, 2008, NRG and its 50/50 joint venture partner, BP, announced the completion of its 150 MW Sherbino wind farm. Since NRG has a 50 percent ownership, Sherbino will provide the Company a net capacity of 75 MW. Elbow Creek Wind Farm On December 29, 2008, NRG, through Padoma, announced the completion of its Elbow Creek project, a wholly owned 120 MW wind farm in Howard County near Big Spring, Texas. The Company funded and developed this wind farm which consists of 53 Siemens wind turbine generators, each capable of generating up to 2.3 MW of power. 76 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations 2008 compared to 2007 The following table provides selected financial information for NRG Energy, Inc., for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change% (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 4,519 $ 4,265 6 % Capacity revenue 1,359 1,196 14 Risk management activities 418 4 N/A Contract amortization 278 242 15 Thermal revenue 114 125 (9 ) Other revenues 197 157 25 Total operating revenues 6,885 5,989 15 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of operations 3,598 3,378 7 Depreciation and amortization 649 658 (1 ) General and administrative 319 309 3 Development costs 46 101 (54 ) Total operating costs and expenses 4,612 4,446 4 Gain on sale of assets 17 (100 ) Operating Income 2,273 1,560 46 Other Income/(Expense) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 59 54 9 Gains on sales of equity method investments 1 (100 ) Other income, net 17 55 (69 ) Refinancing expenses (35 ) (100 ) Interest expense (620 ) (689 ) (10 ) Total other expenses (544 ) (614 ) (11 ) Income from Continuing Operations before income tax expense 1,729 946 83 Income tax expense 713 377 89 Income from Continuing Operations 1,016 569 79 Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense 172 17 N/A Net Income $ 1,188 $ 586 103 Business Metrics Average natural gas price Henry Hub ($/MMbtu) 8.85 7.12 24 % N/A Not applicable 77 Table of Contents Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased by $896 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007. This was due to: Energy revenues increased $254 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007: o Texas increased $172 million, with $219 million of this increase driven by higher prices, offset by $47 million reduced generation. The price variance was attributable to a more favorable mix of merchant versus contract sales, as well as a 28% increase in merchant prices partially offset by a 14% decrease in contract energy prices. The 839 thousand MWh or 2% reduction in generation was comprised of a 3% reduction from nuclear plant generation, a 14% reduction from gas plant generation, offset by a 1% increase in coal plant generation. The reduction in gas plant generation was attributable to the effects of hurricane Ike in September 2008. o Northeast decreased $40 million, with $66 million reduced generation offset by a $26 million increase driven by higher energy prices. The decline due to generation was driven by a net 6% reduction in the regions generation, due to a decrease in oil fired generation as a result of higher average oil prices as well as decrease in gas fired generation related to a cooler summer in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase due to energy prices reflects an average 6% rise in merchant energy prices offset by lower contract revenue, driven by higher costs required to service the PJM contracts, as a result of the increase in market energy prices. o South Central increased $74 million, attributable to higher merchant energy revenues. The growth in merchant energy revenues reflected 577 thousand more merchant MWh sold, as a decrease in contract load MWh allowed more sales to the merchant market at higher prices. o West increased $35 million due to the dispatch of the El Segundo plant outside of the tolling agreement in 2008. In 2007, no such dispatch occurred. Capacity revenues increased $163 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007: o Texas increased $130 million due to a greater proportion of base load contracts, which contain a capacity component. o Northeast increased $13 million reflecting $31 million higher capacity revenues in the PJM and NEPOOL markets offset by a $18 million reduction in capacity revenue in NYISO. o South Central increased $12 million due to a $10 million higher capacity payment from the regions cooperative customers and an $8 million rise in RPM capacity payments from the PJM market. These increases were offset by a $6 million reduction related to lower contract volume to other customers. o West increased $3 million due to a tolling arrangement at Long Beach plant offset by the reduction of revenue from the El Segundo tolling arrangement. Contract amortization revenues increased $36 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007 due to the volume of contracted energy affected by a greater spread between contract prices and market prices used in the Texas Genco purchase accounting. Other revenues increased by $40 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007. The increases arose from greater ancillary services revenue of $28 million and increased activity in the trading of emission allowances and carbon financial instruments of $21 million. These increases were offset by $14 million in lower gas and coal trading activities. 78 Table of Contents Risk management activities revenues from risk management activities include economic hedges that did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges and trading activities. Such revenues increased by $414 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007. The breakdown of changes by region was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2008 Texas Northeast South Central Thermal Total (In millions) Net (losses)/gains on settled positions, or financial revenues $ (95 ) $ 3 $ (16 ) $ 1 $ (107 ) Mark to market results Reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on settled positions related to economic hedges (25 ) (13 ) (38 ) Reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses/(gains) on settled positions related to trading activity 1 (14 ) (19 ) (32 ) Net unrealized gains on open positions related to economic hedges 400 96 4 500 Net unrealized gains on open positions related to trading activity 37 13 45 95 Subtotal mark to market results 413 82 26 4 525 Total derivative gains $ 318 $ 85 $ 10 $ 5 $ 418 NRGs 2008 gain is comprised of $525 million of mark to market gains and $107 million in settled losses, or financial revenue. Of the $525 million of mark to market gains, the $38 million loss represents the reversal of mark to market gains recognized on economic hedges and the $32 million loss represents the reversal of mark to market gains recognized on trading activity. Both of these losses ultimately settled as financial revenues during 2008. The $500 million gain from economic hedge positions included a $524 million increase in value of forward sales of electricity as the result of the reduction in forward power and gas prices at the close of the year ended December 31, 2008. These hedges are considered effective economic hedges that do not receive cash flow hedge accounting treatment. In addition there was a $24 million loss primarily from hedge accounting ineffectiveness related to gas trades in the Texas region which was driven by decreasing forward gas prices while forward power prices declined at a slower pace. NRG also recognized a $95 million unrealized gain associated with the companys trading activity. This gain was primarily due to declining forward electricity and fuel prices. Since these hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk of commodity price movements on revenues the changes in such results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather should be taken together with the effects of pricing and cost changes on energy revenues. During and throughout 2008, NRG hedged a portion of the Companys 2008 through 2013 generation. Since that time, the settled and forward prices of electricity and natural gas have decreased, resulting in the recognition of unrealized mark to market forward gains. Cost of Operations Cost of operations increased $220 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007 but it decreased as a percentage of revenues from 56% for the year ended 2007 compared to 52% for the year ended 2008. Cost of energy increased $213 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007 and as a percentage of revenue it decreased from 41% for 2007 as compared to 38% for 2008. This increase was due to : o Texas Cost of energy increased $59 million due to a net increase in fuel expense and ancillary service costs offset by reductions in nuclear fuel expenses, purchased power expense and amortization of contracts cost. 79 Table of Contents Fuel expense Natural gas costs rose $99 million due to an increase of 28% in average natural gas prices, offset by a 14% decrease in gas fired generation. In addition, coal costs increased by $44 million a result of higher coal prices and the settlement payment related to a coal contract dispute. These increases were offset by a decrease of $19 million in nuclear fuel expense as amortization of nuclear fuel inventory established under Texas Genco purchase accounting ended in early 2008. Purchased energy Purchased energy expense decreased $26 million as a result of lower forced outage rates at the regions base load plants. Ancillary service expense Ancillary services and other costs increased by $14 million as a result of higher ERCOT ISO fees offset by reduced purchased ancillary services costs. Fuel contract amortization Amortized contract costs decreased by $59 million due to a $36 million decrease in the amortization of water supply contracts which ended in 2007. In addition, the amortization of coal contracts decreased by a net $22 million as a result of a reduction in expense related to in the money coal contract amortization. These contracts were established under Texas Genco purchase accounting. o Northeast Cost of energy increased $54 million due to higher fuel costs. Coal costs increased $61 million due to higher coal prices and fuel transportation surcharges. Natural gas costs rose $22 million as a result of 32% higher average natural gas prices, despite 12% lower generation. These increases were offset by a $27 million reduction in oil costs as a result of 55% lower oil fired generation. o South Central Cost of energy increased $56 million due to higher fuel costs and increased purchased energy expense. Fuel expense Coal costs increased $16 million resulting from an increase in coal consumption and higher fuel transportation surcharges; natural gas costs rose by $14 million as the regions peaker plants ran extensively to support transmission system stability after hurricane Gustav. Purchased energy Higher purchased energy expenses of $16 million reflected higher natural gas costs for tolling contracts. Transmission costs Increased by $9 million due to additional point to point transmission costs driven by an increase in merchant energy sales. o West Cost of energy increased $30 million due to the dispatch of the El Segundo plant outside of the tolling agreement in 2008. In 2007, no such dispatch occurred. Other operating costs increased $7 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. This increase was due to: o Texas increased $30 million due to a second planned outage at STP and the acceleration of planned outages at the base load plants. o Northeast decreased $3 million due to $18 million lower operating and maintenance expenses resulting from less outage work at the Norwalk plants and Indian River plants. This was offset by a $16 million increase in utilities cost. The 2007 utilities cost included a benefit of $19 million due to a lower than planned settlement of the station service agreement with CLP. o South Central decreased by $10 million due to reduction in major maintenance expense. The 2007 expense included more extensive outage work that was performed at Big Cajun II plant. o West decreased by $4 million due to a $3 million reduction in lease expenses and an environmental liability of $2 million which was recognized in 2007 related to the El Segundo plant. 80 Table of Contents General and Administrative NRGs GA costs for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased by $10 million compared to 2007, and as a percentage of revenues was 5% in both 2008 and 2007. Wage and benefit costs increased $19 million attributable to higher wages and related benefits cost increases. Consultant cost increased by $3 million resulting from $8 million spent on Exelons exchange offer offset by a $5 million reduction in information technology consultants. Franchise tax The Companys Louisiana state franchise tax decreased by approximately $4 million. Prior year franchise tax was assessed based on the Companys total debt and equity that increased significantly following the acquisition of Texas Genco. Insurance cost decreased by $4 million due to favorable rates. Development Costs NRGs development costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by $55 million compared to 2007. These costs were due to the Companys RepoweringNRG projects: Texas STP units 3 and 4 projects No development expense was reflected in results of operations for 2008 as NRG began to capitalize STP units 3 and 4 development costs incurred after January 1, 2008, following the NRCs docketing of the Companys COLA in late 2007. The Company recorded $52 million in development expenses during 2007. Wind projects The Company incurred $21 million in costs related to wind development which is a $4 million decrease from the same period in 2007. Other projects The Company incurred $25 million in development costs related to other domestic RepoweringNRG projects in 2008, which decreased $7 million from the same period in 2007 as a result of the capitalization of costs to develop the El Segundo Energy Center in 2008. Gain on Sale of Assets The Company reported no gains on sales of assets for 2008. For 2007, NRGs gain on the sale of assets was $17 million. On January 3, 2007, NRG completed the sale of the Companys Red Bluff and Chowchilla II power plants resulting in a pre tax gain of $18 million. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates NRGs equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased by $5 million compared to 2007. This increase was due to a $9 million mark to market unrealized gain on a forward contract for a natural gas swap executed to hedge the future power generation of Sherbino, offset by a $4 million reduction in earnings from international equity investments. Other Income, Net NRGs other income, net decreased by $38 million for 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. The Company recorded a further $23 million impairment charge in 2008 to restructure distressed investments in commercial paper, for which an $11 million impairment charge was taken in the fourth quarter of 2007. This 2008 impairment charge, along with cash receipts of $2 million, reduced the carrying value of the commercial paper to $7 million. In addition, the 2008 results reflect reduced interest income of $25 million from lower market interest rates on cash deposits. 81 Table of Contents Interest Expense NRGs interest expense decreased by $69 million for 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. This decrease was due to interest savings on $531 million debt repayments accompanied by a reduction on the variable interest rates on long term debt. The debt repayments included a $300 million prepayment in December 2007 and an additional payment of $143 million in March 2008 of the Term Loan Facility in connection with the mandatory offer under the Senior Credit Facility. Interest capitalized on RepoweringNRG projects under construction also contributed to this decrease in interest expense. Offsetting this decrease was the $45 million payment made to the Credit Suisse Group, or CS, for the benefit of NRG Common Stock Finance I LLC, or CSF I, in August 2008 to early settle the embedded derivative in the Companys CSF I notes and preferred interests. NRG has interest rate swaps with the objective of fixing the interest rate on a portion of NRGs Senior Credit Facility. These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, and the impact associated with ineffectiveness was immaterial to NRG financial results. For the year ended December 31, 2008, NRG had a deferred loss of $90 million in other comprehensive income compared to a deferred loss of $31 million in 2007. Refinancing Expense There was no refinancing activity in 2008. In 2007, NRG completed a $4.4 billion refinancing of the Companys Senior Credit Facility, resulting in a charge of $35 million from the write off of deferred financing costs as the lenders for 45% of the Term Loan Facility either exited the financing or reduced their holdings and were replaced by other institutions. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased by $336 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007. The effective tax rate was 41.2% and 39.9% for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 (In millions except as otherwise stated) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,729 $ 946 Tax at 35% 605 331 State taxes, net of federal benefit 73 46 Foreign operations (10 ) (13 ) Subpart F taxable income 2 Valuation allowance, including change in state effective rate (12 ) 6 Change in state effective tax rate (11 ) Change in local German effective tax rates (29 ) Foreign dividends 32 26 Non deductible interest 26 10 Permanent differences, reserves, other 8 Income tax expense $ 713 $ 377 Effective income tax rate 41.2 % 39.9 % The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to: Increase in income pre tax income increased by $783 million, with a corresponding increase of $305 million in income tax expense. 82 Table of Contents Permanent differences the Companys effective tax rate differs from the US statutory rate of 35% due to: o Taxable dividends from foreign subsidiaries due to the provision of deferred taxes in 2008 on foreign income no longer expected to be permanently reinvested overseas offset by decreased dividends from foreign operations in the current year, tax expense increased by approximately $6 million as compared to 2007. o Non deductible interest on CAGR Settlement the Companys $45 million settlement of the embedded derivative in its CSF I notes and preferred interests resulted in an additional income tax expense of $16 million in 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007. o Change in German tax rate as a result of revaluing our deferred tax assets, income tax expense benefited by $29 million in 2007, with no comparable benefit in 2008. o Valuation Allowance the Company generated capital gains in 2008 primarily due to the sale of ITISA and derivative contracts that are eligible for capital treatment for tax purposes. These gains enabled NRG to reduce our valuation allowance against capital loss carryforwards. In addition, applicable changes to the state and local effective tax rate are captured in the current period. This resulted in a decrease of $18 million income tax expense in 2008 as compared to 2007. o Change in state effective tax rate the Company reduced its domestic state and local deferred income tax rate from 7% to 6% in the current period. The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances in accordance with SFAS 109. These factors and others, including the Companys history of pre tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax Expense Discontinued operations included ITISA results for 2008 and the same period in 2007. NRG classifies as discontinued operations the income from operations and gains/losses recognized on the sale of projects that were sold or have met the required criteria for such classification pending final disposition. For 2008 and the same period in 2007, NRG recorded income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense, of $172 million and $17 million, respectively. NRG closed the sale of ITISA during the second quarter 2008 and recognized an after tax gain of $164 million. 83 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations 2007 compared to 2006 The following table provides selected financial information for NRG Energy, Inc., for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 4,265 $ 3,155 35 % Capacity revenue 1,196 1,516 (21 ) Risk management activities 4 124 (97 ) Contract amortization 242 628 (61 ) Thermal revenue 125 124 1 Hedge Reset (129 ) (100 ) Other revenues 157 167 (6 ) Total operating revenues 5,989 5,585 7 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of operations 3,378 3,265 3 Depreciation and amortization 658 590 12 General and administrative 309 276 12 Development costs 101 36 181 Total operating costs and expenses 4,446 4,167 7 Gain on sale of assets 17 N/A Operating Income 1,560 1,418 10 Other Income/(Expense) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 54 60 (10 ) Gains on sales of equity method investments 1 8 (88 ) Other income, net 55 156 (65 ) Refinancing expenses (35 ) (187 ) (81 ) Interest expense (689 ) (590 ) 17 Total other expenses (614 ) (553 ) 11 Income from Continuing Operations before income tax expense 946 865 9 Income tax expense 377 322 17 Income from Continuing Operations 569 543 5 Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense 17 78 (78 ) Net Income $ 586 $ 621 (6 ) Business Metrics Average natural gas price Henry Hub ($/MMbtu) 7.12 6.99 2 % N/A Not applicable 84 Table of Contents Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased by $404 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. This was due to: Energy revenues Energy revenues increased by $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006: o Texas energy revenues increased by $972 million, of which $217 million was due to the inclusion of twelve months activity in 2007 compared to eleven months in 2006. Of the remaining $755 million increase, $449 million was due to the Hedge Reset transaction which resulted in higher 2007 average contracted prices of approximately $13 per MWh. In addition, revenues from 8.8 million MWh of generation moved from capacity revenue to energy revenue. Prior to the Acquisition, PUCT regulations required that Texas sell 15% of its capacity by auction at reduced rates. In March 2006, the PUCT accepted NRGs request to no longer participate in these auctions and that capacity is now being sold in the merchant market. These favorable results were partially offset by lower sales from the regions natural gas fired units due to a cooler summer which resulted in lower generation of approximately 2.7 million MWh. o Northeast energy revenues increased by approximately $138 million, of which $61 million was due to a 6% increase in generation, primarily driven by increases at the regions Arthur Kill, Oswego and Indian River plants. The Arthur Kill plant increased generation by 448 thousand MWh due to transmission constraints around New York City, the Oswego plants generation increased by 127 thousand MWh due to a colder winter during 2007 compared to 2006, and the Indian River plants generation increased by 418 thousand MWh due to stronger pricing and fewer outages in the second half of 2007 compared to the second half of 2006. o South Central energy revenues increased by approximately $70 million, due to a new contract which increased contract sales volume by approximately 1.3 million MWh and energy revenues by $69 million. Following a contractual fuel adjustment charge, energy revenues increased by $11 million from the regions cooperative customers. This was offset by a $12 million decrease in merchant energy revenue. o West energy revenues decreased by approximately $72 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, due to the tolling agreement at the Encina plant that has resulted in the receipt of fixed monthly capacity payment in return for the right to schedule and dispatch from the plant. The Encina tolling agreement replaced an RMR agreement under which the plant was called upon to generate and earn energy revenues for such dispatch. Capacity revenues Capacity revenues decreased by $320 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to a decrease in Texas capacity revenues that were partially offset by increases in capacity revenues in the Northeast, South Central and West regions: o Texas capacity revenues decreased by $486 million due to a reduction of capacity auction sales mandated by the PUCT in prior years as previously discussed. o Northeast capacity revenues increased by $81 million of which $39 million of the increase was from the regions NEPOOL assets and $36 million was from the regions PJM assets. The NEPOOL assets benefited from the new LFRM market and transition capacity market, both introduced in the fourth quarter 2006. Capacity revenues increased by $24 million from the LFRM market and $18 million from transition capacity payments, which was offset by a $3 million reduction in capacity payments due to the expiration of the Devon plants RMR agreement on December 31, 2006. On June 1, 2007, the new RPM capacity market became effective in PJM increasing capacity revenues by $36 million as compared to 2006. o South Central capacity revenues increased by approximately $22 million. Of this increase, $15 million was due to higher billing rates as a result of the regions market setting new summer peaks hit in 2006 and 2007, $6 million was due to higher contractual transmission pass though costs to the regions cooperative customers and $3 million was due to improved market conditions at the regions Rockford plants. In 85 Table of Contents August 2007, the region set a new system peak of 2,123 MW which will continue to impact capacity revenue in the first half of 2008. o West capacity revenues increased by approximately $54 million, of which $26 million was related to the inclusion of the first quarter 2007 compared to 2006. New tolling agreements at the regions Encina and Long Beach plants accounted for the remaining difference, with the Encina facility contributing approximately $15 million and the newly repowered Long Beach facility contributing approximately $13 million. Contract amortization revenues from contract amortization decreased by $386 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, as a result of the November 2006 Hedge Reset transaction, which resulted in a write off of a large portion of the Companys out of market power contracts during the fourth quarter 2006. Other revenues Other revenues decreased by $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006 due to: o Sale of emission allowances net sales of SO2 emission allowances decreased by approximately $33 million. In 2006, we sold emissions in lieu of generation due to an unseasonably warm first quarter. Since that time the average market price for SO2 allowances decreased by 28%. o Physical gas sales decreased by $7 million due to the lower sales of excess natural gas. o Ancillary revenues Ancillary services revenue increased by approximately $27 million due to a change in strategy to actively provide ancillary services in the Texas region which increased revenues by $33 million. This was partially offset by a $4 million reduction in ancillary services in the Northeast region due to higher transmission costs following transmission constraints in the New York City area. Risk management activities Gains/losses from risk management activities include economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting, ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges, and trading activities. Such gains were $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The breakdown of changes by region are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 South Texas Northeast Central Total (In millions) Net gains on settled positions, or financial revenues $ 33 $ 43 $ 5 $ 81 Mark to market results Reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on settled positions related to economic hedges (83 ) (45 ) (128 ) Reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on settled positions related to trading activity (1 ) (12 ) (19 ) (32 ) Net unrealized gains on open positions related to economic hedges 19 15 34 Net unrealized (losses)/gains on open positions related to trading activity (1 ) 26 24 49 Subtotal mark to market results (66 ) (16 ) 5 (77 ) Total derivative (losses)/gains $ (33 ) $ 27 $ 10 $ 4 Risk management activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment resulted in a total derivative gain of approximately $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to a $124 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2006. NRGs 2007 derivative gain was comprised of $77 million mark to market losses and $81 million in settled gains, or financial revenue. Of the $77 million of mark to market losses, $128 million represents the reversal of mark to market gains previously recognized on economic hedges and $32 million from the reversal of mark to market gains previously recognized on trading activity. Both of these losses ultimately settled as financial revenues during 2007. The $34 million gain from economic hedge positions was comprised of a $20 million increase in the value of forward sales of electricity and fuel due to favorable power and gas prices and a 86 Table of Contents $14 million gain from hedge accounting ineffectiveness. This ineffectiveness was primarily related to gas swaps and collars in the Texas region due to a change in the correlation between natural gas and power prices. NRG also recognized a $49 million unrealized gain associated with the Companys trading activity. Since these hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk of commodity price movements on revenues and cost of energy sold, the changes in such results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather taken together with the effects of pricing and cost changes on energy revenues. In late 2006 and during the course of 2007, NRG hedged a portion of the Companys 2007 and 2008 generation. Since that time, the settled and forward prices of electricity and natural gas have decreased, resulting in the recognition of unrealized mark to market forward gains and the settlement of realized positions at a gain. In 2006, NRG recognized forward mark to market gains as forward prices of electricity decreased relative to its positions forward; settled loss positions were driven by the out of market gas swaps acquired with the Texas Genco purchase. Cost of Operations Cost of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased by $113 million compared to 2006, but as a percentage of revenues it was 56% for 2007 compared to 58% for 2006. Cost of energy Cost of energy decreased by approximately $24 million, to $2,428 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, and as a percentage of revenue it decreased from 44% for the year ended December 31, 2006, to 41% for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was due to: o Texas cost of energy decreased by $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. This decrease included an additional months expense of $96 million in 2007, without which cost of energy would have decreased by $191 million. This decrease was due to a reduction in natural gas expense and fuel contract amortization, partially offset by increased ancillary service expense. Fuel expense and purchased power expense Natural gas expense decreased by $170 million, which excludes January 2007 natural gas expense of $27 million. This decrease was due to a reduction of 2.7 million MWh in gas fired generation as a result of cooler summer weather, coupled with greater economic purchases from the ERCOT and increased baseload generation. Despite higher coal fired generation at the regions W.A. Parish and Limestone plants, the regions coal expenses, excluding January 2007, decreased by $13 million due to a 9% reduction in average contracted coal prices. Fuel contract amortization decreased by approximately $43 million, excluding January 2007, due to declining forward fuel price curves below the contracted prices used at the Acquisition. Purchased ancillary service expense increased by approximately $34 million due to favorable market prices in purchasing this service in the market compared to providing the service from internal resources. o Northeast cost of energy increased by $26 million primarily due to $30 million in higher natural gas costs related to increased generation at the regions Arthur Kill plant due to its locational advantage to New York City following transmission constraints during the last three quarters of 2007. o South Central cost of energy increased by $104 million due to increases in purchased energy, coal costs and transmission costs. Purchased energy increased by approximately $69 million due to increased market purchases following increased cooperative load requirements and planned maintenance at the regions Big Cajun II facility. Coal costs increased by approximately $17 million, of which $11 million was related to a 9% increase in coal prices and $7 million due to higher coal transportation costs. Transmission costs increased by approximately $16 million of which $6 million was due to contractual increases related to network transmission service. Point to point transmission costs also increased by $10 million reflecting more off system sales. 87 Table of Contents o West Cost of energy decreased by approximately $76 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, due to new tolling agreement entered into at the Encina plant in 2007, which requires the counterparty to supply their own fuel. Under the previous arrangement in 2006, the plant supplied the fuel. Other operating costs Other operating costs which include operations and maintenance expenses, or OM, increased by $137 million, to $950 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. This increase was due to: o Texas other operating costs increased by $75 million, after excluding January 2007 expense of $39 million, other operating costs increased by $36 million. This $36 million increase was due to $25 million in higher OM expense as a result of increased maintenance associated with planned outages and fuel handling at the W.A. Parish facility and $10 million in higher property tax expenses following an increased valuation after the Acquisition. o Northeast other operating costs increased by $18 million due to increased staffing costs and higher maintenance costs. o South Central other operating costs increased by approximately $28 million, $19 million of which was due to increased maintenance expense primarily related to planned outages. Additionally, the region disposed of $4 million in assets in conjunction with the outage. o Acquisition of WCP these results include $15 million of WCP expenses that were not included in the Companys results in 2006. Depreciation and Amortization NRGs depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $68 million compared to 2006. This increase was due to: Texas acquisition the inclusion of Texas results for twelve months in 2007 compared to eleven months in 2006 resulted in an increase of approximately $38 million. Impact of new environmental legislation due to new and more restrictive environmental legislation, the useful life of certain pollution control equipment has been reduced. The Company accelerated depreciation on certain equipment in its Northeast region to reflect the remaining useful life, resulting in increased depreciation of approximately $13 million. General and Administrative NRGs GA costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $33 million compared to 2006, and as a percentage of revenues was 5% in both 2007 and 2006. This increase was due to: Texas and WCP acquisitions the inclusion of Texas results for twelve months in 2007 compared to eleven months in 2006 and the consolidation of WCP for the last three quarters of 2006 resulted in an increase of approximately $9 million. Wage and benefit costs due to the expansion of the Company, including RepoweringNRG initiatives, wages and related benefits costs resulted in a $28 million increase in GA. Additionally, information technology and other office services to support this expansion increased by $8 million. Franchise tax the Companys Louisiana state franchise tax increased by approximately $6 million. This increase was because the states franchise tax was assessed based on the Companys total debt and equity that rose significantly following the acquisition of Texas Genco. Non recurring expenses during 2006 for the year ended December 31, 2006, GA included non recurring fees of $20 million of which $6 million were related to the unsolicited takeover attempt by Mirant Corporation and $14 million associated with the Texas integration efforts. 88 Table of Contents Development Costs NRGs development costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $65 million. These costs were due to the Companys RepoweringNRG projects: Texas on September 24, 2007, NRG filed a COLA with the NRC to build and operate two new nuclear units at the STP site. During the period, NRG incurred $91 million in development costs related to STP units 3 and 4 project in 2007. These development costs were reduced by a $39 million reimbursement related to a partnership agreement signed during the fourth quarter 2007. Wind projects approximately $13 million in development costs related to wind projects primarily in Texas. Other project approximately $4 million in development costs related to other RepoweringNRG projects in the West region. Gain on Sale of Assets NRGs net gain on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2007, was approximately $17 million. On January 3, 2007, NRG completed the sale of the Companys Red Bluff and Chowchilla II power plants resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately $18 million. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates NRGs equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2007, decreased by $6 million compared to 2006. This decrease was due to the sale of multiple equity investments from which the Company earned $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other Income, Net NRGs other income for the year ended December 31, 2007, decreased by $101 million compared to 2006. This decrease was due to the non cash settlement during the first quarter 2006 where NRG recorded $67 million of other income associated with a settlement with an equipment manufacturer related to turbine purchase agreements entered into in 1999 and 2001. The settlement resulted in the reversal of accounts payable totaling $35 million resulting from the discharge of the previously recorded liability, and an adjustment to write up the value of the equipment received to its fair value, resulting in income of approximately $32 million. Additionally, in 2006, other income was favorably impacted by a $13 million non cash gain associated with the discharge of liabilities upon dissolution of an inactive legal entity and a $5 million non cash gain due to a favorable settlement with respect to post closing adjustments on the acquisition of the Companys western New York plants. During 2007, the Company recorded an $11 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter related to an investment in commercial paper reducing its carrying value to approximately $32 million. The Company earned $10 million less in interest income in 2007 compared to 2006, due to lower average cash balances. Interest Expense NRGs interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased by $99 million compared to 2006. This increase was due to: Refinancing for the acquisition of Texas Genco in February 2006 the Company significantly increased its corporate debt facilities from approximately $2 billion as of December 31, 2005, to approximately $7 billion as of February 2, 2006. This increased interest expense by approximately $12 million compared to 2006. Increase of $1.1 billion in debt for Hedge Reset the Company issued $1.1 billion in Senior Notes due 2017 in November 2006 related to the Hedge Reset, which increased interest expense by approximately $72 million. 89 Table of Contents Capital Allocation Program the Company issued a total of $330 million of debt to fund Phase I of the Capital Allocation Program during the second half of 2006. This increased interest expense by $20 million compared to 2006. In the first quarter 2006, NRG entered into interest rate swaps with the objective of fixing the interest rate on a portion of NRGs Senior Credit Facility. These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, and the impact associated with ineffectiveness was immaterial to NRG financial results. For the year ended December 31, 2007, NRG had a deferred loss of $31 million in other comprehensive income compared to deferred gains of $16 million in 2006. Refinancing Expense Refinancing expense decreased by $152 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to higher expense for the refinancing of the Companys corporate debt for the acquisition of Texas Genco on February 2, 2006, compared to the refinancing of the Companys Senior Credit Facility during 2007. On June 8, 2007, NRG completed a $4.4 billion refinancing of the Companys Senior Credit Facility previously announced on May 2, 2007. The transaction resulted in a 0.25% reduction on the spread that the Company pays on its Term Loan Facility and Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility, a $200 million reduction in the Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility to $1.3 billion, and various amendments to provide improved flexibility, efficiency for returning capital to shareholders, asset repowering and investment opportunities. The pricing on the Companys Term Loan Facility and Synthetic Letter of Credit are also subject to further reductions upon the achievement of certain financial ratios. The refinancing resulted in a charge of approximately $35 million to the Companys results of operations that were primarily related to the write off of deferred financing costs as the lenders for approximately 45% of the Term Loan Facility either exited the financing or reduced their holdings and were replaced by other institutions. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased by $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. The effective tax rate was 39.9% and 37.2% for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 (In millions except otherwise stated) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 946 $ 865 Tax at 35% 331 303 State taxes, net of federal benefit 46 34 Foreign operations (13 ) (21 ) Subpart F taxable income 11 Valuation allowance, including change in state effective rate 6 (10 ) Change in state effective tax rate 21 Claimant reserve settlements (28 ) Change in local German effective tax rates (29 ) Foreign dividends 26 1 Non deductible interest 10 3 Permanent differences, reserves, other 8 Income tax expense $ 377 $ 322 Effective income tax rate 39.9 % 37.2 % 90 Table of Contents The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to: Increase in profits income before tax increased by $81 million, with a corresponding increase of approximately $32 million in income tax expense. Permanent differences the Companys effective tax rate differs from the US statutory rate of 35% due to: o Change in German tax rate due to a reduction in the German statutory and resulting effective tax rate, income tax expense benefited by $29 million for the year ended 2007. o Taxable dividends from foreign subsidiaries in January 2007, the Company transferred the proceeds from the sale of its Flinders assets to the US creating additional income tax expense of approximately $25 million. o Lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions lower income tax rates at the Companys foreign locations resulted in additional income tax expense during 2007 compared to 2006 of $8 million. o Non deductible interest interest expense from the stock buybacks from Phase I of the Companys Capital Allocation Program was non deductible for income tax purposes, thus increasing income tax expense by approximately $7 million. o Change in state effective tax rate the state effective tax rate remained unchanged for 2007. This resulted in a net decrease in income tax expense of approximately $5 million as compared to 2006, after taking into account the movement in valuation allowance as a result of the change in rate from 2005 to 2006. o Subpart F taxable income a dividend was declared and paid in 2007 by NRGenerating International B.V. As result of this dividend, there was no Subpart F income compared to 2006. This resulted in a decrease to income tax expense of approximately $11 million. o Disputed claims reserve During 2007 as compared to 2006, the Company made no distribution from its disputed claims reserve, this increased income tax expense by approximately $28 million. The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances in accordance with SFAS 109. These factors and others, including the Companys history of pre tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax Expense For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, NRG recorded income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense of $17 million and $78 million, respectively. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 were comprised of the results of ITISA. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 were comprised of the results of ITISA, Flinders, Audrain and Resource Recovery. NRG closed on the sale of Flinders during the third quarter 2006 and recognized an after tax gain of approximately $60 million from the sale. 91 Table of Contents Results of Operations Regional Discussions Texas Region 2008 compared to 2007 The following table provides selected financial information for the Texas region for the year ended December 31, 2008, and the period ended December 31, 2007.

An HDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. Operating Income Operating income increased by $716 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to: Energy revenues increased by $172 million due to higher merchant energy revenue as a result of higher power prices and sales volumes offset by lower contract energy revenue. Capacity revenue increased by $130 million due to a greater proportion of base load contracts which contain a capacity component. Risk management activities an increase of $351 million was primarily due to $479 million in greater unrealized derivative gains offset by $128 million in greater realized losses on settled financial transactions. These changes reflect a reduction in forward power and gas prices at the close of the year ended December 31, 2008. 92 Table of Contents These increases were offset by: Cost of energy increased by $59 million reflecting the effects of increased natural gas and coal prices. Operating Revenues Total operating revenues from the Texas region increased by $739 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007 due to the following: Risk management activities gains of $318 million were recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to a $33 million loss in the same period in 2007. The $318 million included $413 million of unrealized mark to market gains and $95 million in settled losses, or financial revenue. The $413 million was the net effect of a $400 million gain from economic hedge positions and a $25 million loss on reversals of mark to market gains on economic hedges. In addition, there were $37 million in unrealized mark to market gains on trading transactions combined with a $1 million gain on reversals of mark to market losses on trading activity. The $400 million gain from economic hedges incorporated $424 million in unrealized gains in the value of forward sales of electricity and fuel driven by lower power and natural gas prices. These hedges were considered effective economic hedges that do not receive cash flow hedge accounting treatment. The remaining $24 million in losses were from hedge ineffectiveness which was driven by decreasing gas prices while power prices decreased at a slower pace. Energy revenues increased by $172 million due to: o Energy prices increased by $219 million due to a more favorable mix of merchant versus contract sales resulting in a 28% increase in merchant prices offset by a 14% decrease in contract energy prices. o Generation decreased by 839 thousand MWh or 2%. This decrease in generation was due to a 3% decline in nuclear generation at STP, as a result of additional plant outages, and a 14% decline in overall gas plant generation for the year ended December 2008. Hurricane Ike in September 2008 caused major damage to the Houston area transmission grid which reduced significantly the demand for power causing a decrease in gas fired generation. These declines were offset by a 1% increase in coal generation in 2008. Capacity revenue increased by $130 million due to a greater proportion of base load contracts which contain a capacity component. Other revenues increased by $50 million related to a $23 million increase in ancillary services revenue in 2008, a $22 million increase of allocations for trading of emission allowances and carbon financial instruments, and increased activity in trading natural gas and coal of $4 million. Contract amortization revenue increased by $36 million due to the volume of contracted energy being positively affected by a greater spread between contract prices and market prices used in the Texas Genco purchase accounting. Cost of Energy Cost of energy for the Texas region increased by $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007 due to the following: Natural gas costs increased by $99 million due to a 28% rise in average gas prices offset by a 14% decrease in gas fired generation. Coal costs increased by $44 million due to higher coal prices and the settlement of a coal contract dispute. Ancillary services increased by $14 million due to a $16 million rise in ancillary service costs purchased through ERCOT, offset by a $2 million decrease in other purchased ancillary services costs. 93 Table of Contents These increases were partially offset by: Amortized contract costs decreased by $59 million due to a $36 million decrease in the amortization of water supply contracts which ended in 2007. In addition, the amortization of coal contracts decreased by a net $22 million as a result of a reduction in expense related to in the money coal contract amortization. These contracts were established under Texas Genco purchase accounting. Nuclear fuel expense decreased by $19 million as amortization of nuclear fuel inventory established under Texas Genco purchase accounting ended in early 2008. Purchased power decreased by $26 million due to lower forced outage rates at the regions baseload plants. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the Texas region decreased by $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007 due to the following: Development costs decreased by $59 million primarily due to the initial costs for developing the nuclear units 3 and 4 at STP associated with the RepoweringNRG initiative that began in 2007. Costs for STP nuclear units 3 and 4 are being capitalized in 2008. This decrease was primarily offset by: Operations maintenance expense increased by $32 million due to an additional planned outage at STP and the acceleration of planned outages at the baseload plants. General and Administrative expense increased by $10 million driven by higher corporate allocations. 94 Table of Contents 2007 compared to 2006 The following table provides selected financial information for the Texas region for the year ended December 31, 2007, and the period ended December 31, 2006.

The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. (b) For the period February 2, 2006 to December 31, 2006 only. Operating Income For the year ended December 31, 2007, operating income increased by $88 million compared to 2006; however, excluding January 2007 results, operating income increased by $21 million. The primary drivers were: Energy Revenues for eleven months of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 were up by $755 million, $449 million of which was due to the Hedge Reset transaction, as the average price of the underlying power contracts increased by $13 per MWh compared to average contract prices prior to the hedge reset. The balance of the increase in energy revenues was due to the sale of additional output as energy rather than under PUCT mandated capacity auctions. This favorable result was offset by: Capacity Revenues reduction in capacity auction sales reduced capacity revenues by approximately $517 million, excluding January 2007. 95 Table of Contents Contract Amortization the Hedge Reset transaction decreased contract amortization by approximately $498 million, excluding January 2007. Gas fired Generation lower natural gas fired generation of approximately 2.7 million MWh, for the comparable eleven month period in 2007, was a result of cooler summer weather coupled with increased economic purchases of energy and ancillary services from the ERCOT. Lower sales revenue for the eleven months was offset by natural lower natural gas fuel costs of $170 million and cash flow economic hedge improvements. Development Costs increased by $44 million in 2007 compared to 2006 largely due to the development of STP nuclear units 3 and 4 project, including $2 million of expenses in January 2007. The $44 million increase also includes $39 million in reimbursements from a partnership agreement signed in the fourth quarter 2007. Operating Revenues Total operating revenues from the Texas region increased by $199 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. Excluding January 2007, operating revenues decreased by $56 million. This decrease was due to: Energy revenues energy revenues increased by $972 million, of which $217 million was due to the inclusion of twelve months activity in 2007 compared to eleven months in 2006. Of the remaining $755 million increase, $449 million was due to the Hedge Reset transaction which resulted in higher 2007 average contracted prices of approximately $13 per MWh. In addition, revenues from 8.8 million MWh of generation moved from capacity revenue to energy revenue. Prior to the Acquisition, PUCT regulations required that NRG Texas sell 15% of its capacity by auction at reduced rates. In March 2006, the PUCT accepted NRGs request to no longer participate in these auctions and that capacity is now being sold in the merchant market. These favorable results were partially offset by lower sales from natural gas fired units due to a cooler summer which resulted in lower natural gas fired generation of approximately 2.7 million MWh. Other revenues the regions other revenues decreased by $27 million for the eleven months of 2007 compared to 2006. This was due to a decrease in intercompany emission allowance sales of $40 million and a $19 million decrease in physical gas sales. This $59 million decrease was offset by a $33 million increase in ancillary services revenue due to a change in strategy to more actively provide ancillary services in the Texas region. Capacity revenues capacity revenues decreased by $517 million, excluding $31 million incurred in January 2007. This decrease was due to the reduction of capacity auction sales mandated by the PUCT in prior years as described above. Contract amortization revenues from contract amortization excluding January 2007 decreased by $405 million primarily due to the write off of out of market power contracts during the fourth quarter 2006 related to the Hedge Reset transaction. Risk management activities The Texas region recorded a total of $33 million in derivative losses for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to a $30 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2006. The Texas regions 2007 derivative loss was comprised of $66 million of mark to market losses and $33 million in settled gains, or financial revenue. Of the $66 million of mark to market losses, $83 million represents the reversal of mark to market gains previously recognized on economic hedges and $1 million from the reversal of mark to market gains previously recognized on trading activity. Both of these losses ultimately settled as financial revenues during 2007. The $19 million gain from economic hedge positions was comprised of an $8 million increase in the value of forward sales of electricity and fuel due to favorable power and natural gas prices and a $11 million gain from hedge accounting ineffectiveness. This ineffectiveness was primarily related to gas swaps and collars due to a change in the correlation between natural gas and power prices. 96 Table of Contents Cost of Energy Cost of energy for the Texas region decreased by $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. This included an additional months expense for January 2007 of $96 million, without which cost of energy would have decreased by $191 million. This decrease was due to: Fuel expense natural gas expense decreased by $170 million, excluding the January 2007 expense of $27 million, due to a decrease of 2.7 million MWh in natural gas fired generation as a result of cooler summer weather, coupled with greater economic purchases of energy and ancillary services from the ERCOT and increased baseload generation. Coal expenses, excluding January 2007, decreased by $13 million due to a 9% reduction in average contracted coal prices in 2007, despite a 1.1 million MWh increase in coal fired generation at the regions W.A. Parish and Limestone plants. Purchased ancillary service increased by approximately $34 million due to the favorable market prices in purchasing this service in the market compared to providing the service from internal resources causing an associated decrease in natural gas expense. Fuel contract amortization decreased by approximately $43 million, excluding January 2007, due to declining forward fuel price curves below the contracted prices used at acquisition in February 2006. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the Texas region increased by $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. This included an additional months expense for January 2007, of $53 million, without which other operating expenses would have increased by $97 million. This increase was due to: Development costs on September 24, 2007, NRG filed a COLA with the NRC. The Company incurred $91 million in development costs related to STP nuclear unit 3 and 4 project in 2007, including $2 million in January 2007, compared to development costs of $14 million in 2006. Of the $91 million incurred this year, $39 million was reimbursed through a partnership agreement in the fourth quarter 2007. Fossil development costs were $6 million in 2007. Plant OM expense increased by $25 million, excluding January 2007, due to increased maintenance associated with planned outages and fuel handling at W.A. Parish, increased maintenance related to higher utilization in 2006 of the regions natural gas fleet, and retirement of older assets. Corporate allocations were higher by approximately $16 million. Property tax expense increased by approximately $10 million related to the Texas acquisition. 97 Table of Contents Northeast Region 2008 compared to 2007 The following table provides selected financial information for the Northeast region for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 1,064 $ 1,104 (4 )% Capacity revenue 415 402 3 Risk management activities 85 27 215 Other revenues 66 72 (8 ) Total operating revenues 1,630 1,605 2 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 695 641 8 Depreciation and amortization 109 102 7 Other operating expenses 392 404 (3 ) Operating Income $ 434 $ 458 (5 ) MWh sold (in thousands) 13,349 14,163 (6 ) MWh generated (in thousands) 13,349 14,163 (6 ) Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 91.70 $ 76.37 20 Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 611 702 (13 ) CDDs 30 year rolling average 537 537 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 6,057 6,074 HDDs 30 year rolling average 6,294 6,261 1 % (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. An HDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. Operating Income Operating income decreased by $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due to: Cost of energy increased by $54 million due to higher coal costs, increased coal transportation surcharges and higher natural gas prices. The increase was offset by lower oil costs from lower oil fired generation. This unfavorable variance was offset by: Operating revenues increased by $25 million due to higher capacity revenue and risk management revenues partially offset by lower energy revenue. Other operating expenses decreased by $12 million due to lower major maintenance expenses and property taxes offset by higher utilities expense. 98 Table of Contents Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased by $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due to: Risk management activities gains of $85 million were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to gains of $27 million during the same period in 2007. The $85 million gain includes $82 million of unrealized mark to market gains and $3 million of gains in settled transactions, or financial revenue. The $82 million unrealized gains is the net effect of a $96 million gain from economic hedge positions, the $13 million loss due to the reversal of previously recognized mark to market gains on economic hedges, the $14 million loss due to the reversal of mark to market gains on trading activity and $13 million in unrealized mark to market gains on trading activity. Gains are driven by increases in power and gas prices. Capacity revenues increased by $13 million due to: o PJM capacity revenues increased by $20 million reflecting recognition of a year of revenue from the RPM capacity market (effective on June 1, 2007) in 2008 compared to seven months in 2007. o NEPOOL capacity revenues increased $11 million due to increased revenue recognized on the Norwalk RMR contract (effective on June 19, 2007) in 2008 compared to seven months in 2007. o NYISO capacity revenues decreased by $18 million due to unfavorable market prices. The lower capacity market prices are a result of NYISOs reductions in Installed Reserve Margins and ICAP in city mitigation rules effective March 2008. These decreases were offset by higher capacity contract revenue. These gains were offset by: Energy revenues decreased by $40 million due to: o Energy prices increased by a net $26 million. An average 6% rise in merchant energy prices resulted in an increase of $64 million. This increase was offset by lower contract revenue of $38 million driven by higher net costs incurred to service PJM contracts as a result of the increase in market energy prices. o Generation decreased by $66 million due to a net 6% decrease in generation. The decrease in generation represented a 55% decrease in oil fired generation as these oil fired plants were not dispatched due to 41% higher average oil prices. In addition, there was a 12% decrease in gas fired generation related to a cooler summer in 2008 as compared to 2007. Coal generation was flat in 2008 compared to 2007. Other revenues decreased by $6 million due to lower allocations of net physical sales in 2008 of $17 million offset by higher allocations for trading of emission allowances and carbon financial instruments of $10 million. Cost of Energy Cost of energy increased by $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, due to: Coal costs increased by $61 million due to higher coal costs and fuel transportation surcharges. Natural gas costs increased by $22 million, despite 12% lower generation, due to a 32% higher average natural gas prices. These increases were offset by: Oil costs decreased by $27 million due to lower oil fired generation of 55% as these plants were not dispatched in 2008 due to 41% higher average oil prices. 99 Table of Contents Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses decreased by $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, due to: Major Maintenance decreased $18 million as a result of less outage work at the Norwalk and Indian River plants. Property taxes decreased $10 million due to $4 million in property tax credits received in 2008 at our New York City plants and higher property credits received in 2008 at our Western New York plants. These decreases were offset by: Utilities expense increased by $16 million as a result of a $19 million benefit included in the 2007 utilities cost due to a lower than planned settlement of the station service agreement with CLP. 2007 compared to 2006 The following table provides selected financial information for the Northeast region for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 1,104 $ 966 14 % Capacity revenue 402 321 25 Risk management activities 27 144 (81 ) Other revenues 72 112 (36 ) Total operating revenues 1,605 1,543 4 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 641 615 4 Depreciation and amortization 102 89 15 Other operating expenses 404 378 7 Operating Income $ 458 $ 461 (1 ) MWh sold (in thousands) 14,163 13,309 6 MWh generated (in thousands) 14,163 13,309 6 Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 76.37 $ 67.73 13 Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 702 653 8 CDDs 30 year rolling average 537 537 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 6,074 5,417 12 % HDDs 30 year rolling average 6,261 6,261 (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region.

Other operating expenses increased by $26 million primarily due to increased maintenance and staffing costs combined with higher property tax. Depreciation increased by $13 million reflecting the additional depreciation expense following the reduction in estimated useful lives of certain components of the regions power plants as a result of new environmental regulation. Offset by higher operating revenues of approximately $62 million due to increased generation, favorable pricing and the favorable impact from new capacity markets. This was partially offset by lower gains in the regions risk management activities and lower sales of emission allowances due to a 28% reduction in market prices. Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased by $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to: Energy revenues increased by approximately $138 million, of which $61 million was due to increased generation, and $88 million due to a 9% increase in average realized market prices partially offset by an $11 million reduction in contracted bilateral energy revenues. o Generation increased by 6%, primarily driven by increases at the regions Arthur Kill, Oswego and Indian River plants. The Arthur Kill plant increased generation by 448 thousand MWh due to transmission constraints around New York City, the Oswego plants generation increased by 127 thousand MWh due to a colder winter during 2007 compared to 2006, and Indian River plants generation increased by 418 thousand MWh due to stronger pricing and fewer outages. o Price on average, realized prices in the Northeast increased by 9% due to a mix of higher priced New York City generation coupled with improved economic energy hedge trading resulting in a $37 million increase in energy revenues. Capacity revenues increased by $81 million, of which $39 million was from the regions NEPOOL assets, $36 million from the regions PJM assets and $6 million from the regions New York Rest of State assets. o NEPOOL The regions NEPOOL assets benefited from the new LFRM market and transition capacity market, both of which were introduced in the fourth quarter 2006. Capacity revenues increased by $24 million from the LFRM market and $18 million from transition capacity payments, which were partially offset by a $3 million reduction due to the expiration of an RMR agreement for the regions Devon plant on December 31, 2006 and by RMR payments from the regions Norwalk plant which began in the third quarter 2007. o PJM On June 1, 2007, the new RPM capacity market became effective in PJM increasing capacity revenues by approximately $36 million. o NYISO New York Rest of State capacity prices increased by 75% as load requirement growth increased demand for capacity. This was coupled with the impact from the new capacity markets in NEPOOL which reduced exported supply into the New York market that further improved the supply/demand dynamics. 101 Table of Contents These were partially offset by: Risk management activities The Northeast region recorded $27 million in derivative gain for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to a $144 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2006. The regions 2007 derivative gain was comprised of $16 million of mark to market losses and $43 million in settled gains, or financial revenue. Of the $16 million of mark to market losses, $45 million represents the reversal of mark to market gains previously recognized on economic hedges and $12 million from the reversal of mark to market gains previously recognized on trading activity. Both of these losses ultimately settled as financial revenues during 2007. The region also recognized a $15 million unrealized gain from economic hedge positions which was comprised primarily of a $13 million increase in the value of forward sales of electricity and fuel due to favorable power and gas prices. The region also recognized a $26 million unrealized gain associated with the Companys trading activity. The $144 million derivative gain for the year ended December 31, 2006 was comprised of a $154 million unrealized mark to market gain and $10 million in settled losses. Most of these unrealized gains reversed out in 2007. Other revenues decreased by $40 million, of which approximately $48 million was due to reduced activity in the trading of emission allowances following both an increase in generation and a 28% decrease in market prices. This decrease was partially offset by an $11 million increase in physical gas sales to third parties due to favorable trading opportunities in the market. Cost of Energy Cost of energy increased by $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to $30 million in higher natural gas costs related to increased generation at the regions Arthur Kill plant due to its locational advantage to New York City following transmission constraints during the last three quarters of 2007. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased by $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to: Plant OM spending of $15 million due to increased plant staffing costs of $7 million, increased maintenance costs of $6 million and increased environmental remediation costs of $2 million. Property tax increased by approximately $3 million due to a favorable tax decision in 2006 related to NYC assets of $10 million partially offset by a tax law change the same year that resulted in a reduction of property tax receivable of $5 million in 2006 and a $2 million reduction in property taxes at the New England plants in 2007. Regional GA expenditures Regional staffing and benefits increased by $3 million primarily related to the regions RepoweringNRG development efforts while corporate allocations increased by $5 million. 102 Table of Contents South Central Region 2008 compared to 2007 The following table provides selected financial information for the South Central region for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 478 $ 404 18 % Capacity revenue 233 221 5 Risk management activities 10 10 Contract amortization 23 23 Other revenues 2 N/A Total operating revenues 746 658 13 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 468 412 14 Depreciation and amortization 67 68 (1 ) Other operating expenses 111 121 (8 ) Operating Income $ 100 $ 57 75 MWh sold (in thousands) 12,447 12,452 MWh generated (in thousands) 11,148 10,930 2 Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 71.25 $ 59.62 20 Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 1,618 1,963 (18 ) CDDs 30 year rolling average 1,547 1,547 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 3,672 3,236 13 HDDs 30 year rolling average 3,623 3,604 1 % (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. An HDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region. The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. Operating Income Operating income increased by $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, due to: Operating revenues increased by $88 million due to increases in energy revenue and capacity revenue. Cost of energy increased by $56 million due to higher purchased energy, coal transportation costs, natural gas and transmission costs. Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased by $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due to: Energy revenues increased by $74 million due to higher merchant energy revenues. A decline in contract sales of 577 thousand MWh allowed for increased sales into the merchant market at higher prices. Merchant 103 Table of Contents energy sales increased 573 thousand MWh. Revenue from contract load was flat as higher fuel cost pass through adjustments for the regions cooperative customers were offset by reductions in contract volume to other contract customers. Capacity revenues increased by $12 million. Capacity payments from the regions cooperative customers increased by $10 million due to new peak loads set by the regions cooperative customers and increased transmission and environmental pass through costs. Increased RPM capacity payments from the regions Rockford facilities in the PJM market contributed an additional $8 million. These increases were offset by a reduction in contract volumes to other customers of $6 million. Risk Management Activities gains of $10 million were recognized during 2008 compared to $10 million in gains recognized during the same period in 2007. Unrealized gains in 2008 of $26 million were offset by realized losses of $16 million. The $26 million unrealized gain was the net effect of a $45 million unrealized mark to market gain from trading activities in the region offset by the reversal of $19 million loss of previously recognized mark to market gains on trading activity. Unrealized gains were primarily driven by decreases in power and gas prices relative to our forward positions. Cost of Energy Cost of energy increased by $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due to: Purchased energy increased by $16 million reflecting a 21% increase in the average cost per MWh of purchased energy which reflects higher gas costs associated with the regions tolling agreements. This increase was offset by an 8% decrease in purchased MWh as increased plant availability and lower contract load requirements reduced the need to purchase power. Coal costs increased by $16 million due to a $2 per ton increase in fuel transportation surcharges combined with a 1% increase in coal generation. These increases were offset by a $3 million decrease in allocated rail car lease fees. Natural gas costs increased $14 million. The regions Bayou Cove and Big Cajun I peaker plants ran extensively to support transmission system stability after hurricane Gustav in September 2008. Transmission costs increased by $9 million due to additional point to point transmission costs driven by an increase in merchant energy sales. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses decreased by approximately $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, due to: GA Expense Franchise tax decreased by $5 million due to retroactive charges recorded in 2007. The Louisiana state franchise tax is assessed on the Companys total debt and equity that significantly increased following the Acquisition of Texas Genco. This decrease was offset by $6 million in higher corporate allocations in 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Operating and maintenance expense Major maintenance decreased by $9 million due to more extensive spring outage work performed at the Big Cajun II plant in 2007 compared to the same period in 2008. Normal maintenance rose $2 million as a result of increased forced outages and higher contractor costs. Asset retirements decreased by $4 million reflecting disposals associated with the 2007 outage work at Big Cajun II. 104 Table of Contents 2007 compared to 2006 The following table provides selected financial information for the South Central region for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 404 $ 334 21 % Capacity revenue 221 199 11 Risk management activities 10 13 (23 ) Contract amortization 23 19 21 Other revenues 5 (100 ) Total operating revenues 658 570 15 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 412 308 34 Depreciation and amortization 68 68 Other operating expenses 121 89 36 Operating Income $ 57 $ 105 (46 ) MWh sold (in thousands) 12,452 11,845 5 MWh generated (in thousands) 10,930 11,036 (1 ) Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 59.62 $ 56.18 6 Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 1,963 1,797 9 CDDs 30 year rolling average 1,547 1,547 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 3,236 3,169 2 % HDDs 30 year rolling average 3,604 3,604 (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region.

The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. Operating Income Operating income for the region declined by $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to higher operating expenses, despite a 1% decrease in generation at the regions Big Cajun II plant. Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased by $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to: Energy revenues increased by approximately $70 million due to a new contract which contributed $69 million in contract energy revenues, increasing contract sales volume by approximately 1.3 million MWh. A contractual change in the fuel adjustment charge for the regions cooperative customers increased energy revenues by an additional $11 million. This was offset by a $12 million decrease in merchant energy revenue as a result of satisfying increasing load requirement from the new contract. 105 Table of Contents Capacity revenues increased by approximately $22 million, of which $15 million was due to higher rates as a result of the region setting new summer peaks in 2006 and 2007; the new system peak of 2,123 MW set in August 2007 will continue to impact capacity revenue in the first half of 2008. Higher network transmission costs, which are passed through to the regions cooperative customers, also increased capacity revenues by $6 million. Improved market conditions in PJM resulted in an increase of $3 million in merchant capacity revenue from the Rockford plants. Cost of Energy Cost of energy increased by $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to: Purchased energy increased by approximately $69 million as planned and maintenance outage hours at the regions Big Cajun II facility increased by 1,209 hours, primarily due to the planned turbine/generator outage at the Big Cajun II Unit 3 facility in the fourth quarter 2007. These increases were offset by a drop of $2.53/MWh in realized purchased power prices. Coal costs increased by approximately $17 million, of which approximately $11 million was due to a 9% increase in coal prices and $7 million due to higher coal transportation costs. Transmission costs increased by approximately $16 million. Network transmission costs, which are passed through to the regions cooperative customers, increased by $6 million due to load growth and increased utilization of the Entergy transmission system. Point to point transmission costs to support off system sales increased by $10 million. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased by approximately $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, due to: Maintenance expense increased by approximately $19 million as the scope of work on planned outages were more extensive in 2007. The Big Cajun II Unit 3 facility incurred a major planned outage in the fourth quarter 2007, during which the generator was rewound, turbine controls were replaced with a modern digital control system, and the turbine steam path was replaced with a high efficiency design. Asset disposals in conjunction with the outage added $4 million. Franchise tax Louisiana state franchise tax increased by approximately $6 million due to an increased assessment based on the Companys total debt and equity. The Companys total debt and equity increased significantly following the acquisition of Texas Genco. 106 Table of Contents West Region 2008 compared to 2007 The following table provides selected financial information for the West region for the years ended December 31, 2008, and 2007: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 39 $ 4 N/A Capacity revenue 125 122 2 % Risk management activities N/A Other revenues 7 1 N/A Total operating revenues 171 127 35 Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 35 5 N/A Depreciation and amortization 8 3 167 Other operating expenses 70 80 (13 ) Operating Income $ 58 $ 39 49 MWh sold (in thousands) 1,532 1,246 23 MWh generated (in thousands) 1,532 1,246 23 Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 82.62 $ 66.52 24 Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 953 785 21 CDDs 30 year rolling average 704 704 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 3,190 3,048 5 % HDDs 30 year rolling average 3,243 3,228 (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region.

Operating income increased by $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, due to: Energy revenues increased by $35 million due to the 2008 dispatch of the El Segundo plant outside of the tolling agreement in 2008. In 2007, no such dispatch occurred. Other operating expense decreased by $10 million as a result of a $5 million reduction in RepoweringNRG expenses due to the capitalization of cost for the El Segundo Energy Center project in 2008. In addition there was a $3 million reduction in lease expenses in 2008 and the recognition of a $2 million environmental liability for the El Segundo plant in 2007. Other revenues increased by $6 million due to higher allocations for trading of emission allowances in 2008. 107 Table of Contents Capacity revenues increased by $3 million primarily due to the tolling agreement at the Long Beach plant partially offset by the expiration of a two year tolling agreement at the El Segundo facility: o Long Beach On August 1, 2007, NRG successfully completed the repowering of a 260 MW natural gas fueled generating plant at its Long Beach generating facility. The plant contributed $15 million in incremental capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. o El Segundo The expiration of the two year tolling agreement at the end of April resulted in a decrease of $11 million in capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. These increases were partially offset by: Cost of energy increased by $30 million due to the dispatch of the El Segundo plant outside of the tolling agreement in 2008. In 2007, no such dispatch occurred. Depreciation and amortization increased by $5 million, reflecting depreciation associated with the repowered plant at the Long Beach generating facility. 2007 compared to 2006 The following table provides selected financial information for the West region for the years ended December 31, 2007, and 2006: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change % (In millions except otherwise noted) Operating Revenues Energy revenue $ 4 $ 75 (95 )% Capacity revenue 122 68 79 Risk management activities (3 ) 100 Other revenues 1 6 (83 ) Total operating revenues 127 146 (13 ) Operating Costs and Expenses Cost of energy 5 80 (94 ) Depreciation and amortization 3 3 Other operating expenses 80 55 45 Operating Income $ 39 $ 8 388 MWh sold (in thousands) 1,246 1,901 (34 ) MWh generated (in thousands) 1,246 1,901 (34 ) Business Metrics Average on peak market power prices ($/MWh) $ 66.52 $ 61.54 8 Cooling Degree Days, or CDDs(a) 785 926 (15 ) CDDs 30 year rolling average 704 704 Heating Degree Days, or HDDs(a) 3,048 3,001 2 % HDDs 30 year rolling average 3,228 3,228 (a) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center A CDD represents the number of degrees that the mean temperature for a particular day is above 65 degrees Fahrenheit in each region.

Excluding the consolidation of WCPs results following the acquisition of Dynegys 50% interest on March 31, 2006, operating income increased by $24 million, due to: Capacity revenues increased by approximately $28 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, due to new tolling agreements at the regions Encina and Long Beach plants: o Encina In January 2007, NRG signed a new tolling agreement for the regions Encina plant which contributed $15 million in capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. o Long Beach The repowered plant at the Long Beach generating facility contributed approximately $13 million in capacity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. Cost of energy decreased by $76 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, due to the new tolling agreement entered into at the Encina plant in 2007, which required the counterparty to supply its own fuel. Under the previous arrangement in 2006, the plant supplied the fuel. This increase was offset by: Energy revenues decreased by approximately $72 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, primarily due to the tolling agreement at the Encina plant that has resulted in the receipt of a fixed monthly capacity payment in return for the right to schedule and dispatch from the plant. The Encina tolling agreement replaced the RMR agreement under which the plant was called upon to generate revenues for such dispatch. OM expense increased by approximately $6 million, excluding the first quarter 2007, primarily due to increases in labor costs, major maintenance and auxiliary power. Development expenses increased by $4 million, reflecting RepoweringNRG initiatives at the regions El Segundo and Encina sites. Other revenues decreased ancillary service revenue of $3 million at the Encina plant due to the new tolling agreement that consigns ancillary service revenue to the counterparty in exchange for a fixed monthly capacity payment. 109 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Position As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, NRGs liquidity, excluding collateral received, was approximately $3.4 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, comprised of the following: As of December 31, 2008 2007 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,494 $ 1,132 Funds deposited by counterparties 754 Restricted cash 16 29 Total cash 2,264 1,161 Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility availability 860 557 Revolver Credit Facility availability 1,000 997 Total liquidity 4,124 2,715 Less: Funds deposited as collateral by hedge counterparties (760 ) Total liquidity, excluding collateral received $ 3,364 $ 2,715 For the year ended December 31, 2008, total liquidity increased by $1.4 billion due to a rise in funds deposited of $754 million as well as higher cash balances of $362 million. Changes in cash balances are further discussed hereinafter under Cash Flow Discussion. Cash and cash equivalents and funds deposited by counterparties at December 31, 2008 are predominantly held in money market funds invested in treasury securities or treasury repurchase agreements. The line item Funds deposited by counterparties consist of cash collateral received from hedge counterparties in support of energy risk management activities, and it is the Companys intention as of December 31, 2008 to limit the use of these funds. The increase in these amounts is due to the in the money position of our transactions following the drop in commodity prices since the summer of 2008. Depending on market fluctuation and the settlement of the underlying contracts, the Company will refund this collateral to the counterparties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the underlying trades. The Companys balance sheet reflects a liability for cash collateral received within current liabilities. Management believes that the Companys liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance operating and maintenance capital expenditures, to fund dividends to NRGs preferred shareholders, and other liquidity commitments. Management continues to regularly monitor the Companys ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity in a manner consistent with its intention to maintain a net debt to capital ratio in the range of 45 60%. Credit Ratings Credit rating agencies rate a firms public debt securities. These ratings are utilized by the debt markets in evaluating a firms credit risk. Ratings influence the price paid to issue new debt securities by indicating to the market the Companys ability to pay principal, interest, and preferred dividends. Rating agencies evaluate a firms industry, cash flow, leverage, liquidity, and hedge profile, among other factors, in their credit analysis of a firms credit risk. As of December 31, 2008, NRGs credit ratings are on positive watch from both SP and Moodys rating agencies. 110 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the credit ratings for NRG Energy, Inc., its Term Loan Facility and its senior notes as of December 31, 2008: SP Moodys Fitch NRG Energy, Inc. B+ Ba3 B 7.375% Senior Notes, due 2016, 2017 B B1 B+ 7.25% Senior Notes due 2014 B B1 B+ Term Loan Facility BB Ba1 BB SOURCES OF FUNDS The principal sources of liquidity for NRGs future operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived from new and existing financing arrangements, asset sales, existing cash on hand and cash flows from operations. Financing Arrangements Senior Credit Facility As of December 31, 2008, NRG has a Senior Credit Facility which is comprised of a senior first priority secured term loan, or the Term Loan Facility, a $1.0 billion senior first priority secured revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, and a $1.3 billion senior first priority secured synthetic letter of credit facility, or the Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility was last amended on June 8, 2007. As of December 31, 2008, NRG had issued $440 million of letters of credit under the Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility, leaving $860 million available for future issuances. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, as of December 31, 2008, NRG had not issued any letters of credit. First and Second Lien Structure NRG has granted first and second liens to certain counterparties on substantially all of the Companys assets. NRG uses the first or second lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out of the money hedge agreements for forward sales of power or MWh equivalents. To the extent that the underlying hedge positions for a counterparty are in the money to NRG, the counterparty would have no claim under the lien program. The lien program limits the volume that can be hedged, not the value of underlying out of the money positions. The first lien program does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. Within the first and second lien structure, the Company can hedge up to 80% of its baseload capacity and 10% of its non baseload assets with these counterparties for the first 60 months and then declining thereafter. Net exposure to a counterparty on all trades must be positively correlated to the price of the relevant commodity for the first lien to be available to that counterparty. The first and second lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date. The Companys lien counterparties may have a claim on our assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged price. As of December 31, 2008 and February 2, 2009, the first lien exposure of net out of the money positions to counterparties on hedges was $88 million and $43 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008 and February 2, 2009, there was no exposure to out of the money positions to counterparties on hedges under the second lien. The following table summarizes the amount of MWs hedged against the Companys baseload assets and as a percentage relative to the Companys forecasted baseload capacity under the first and second lien structure as of February 2, 2009: Equivalent Net Sales Secured by First and Second Lien Structure(a) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 In MW(b) 4,967 4,600 3,788 2,196 828 As a percentage of total forecasted baseload capacity(c) 71 % 67 % 56 % 33 % 12 % (a) Equivalent Net Sales include natural gas swaps converted using a weighted average heat rate by region. (b) 2009 MW value consists of March through December positions only. (c) Forecasted baseload capacity under the first and second lien structure represents 80% of the total Companys baseload assets. 111 Table of Contents Common Stock Finance I Debt The Companys Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes indentures contain restricted payment provisions limiting the use of funds for transactions such as common share repurchases. To maintain restricted payment capacity under the Senior Notes indentures, in March 2008 the Company executed an arrangement with CS to extend maturities of CSF Is notes and preferred interests from October 2008 to June 2010. In addition, the settlement date of an embedded derivative, or CSF I CAGR, which is based on NRGs share price appreciation above a threshold price, was extended 30 days to early December 2008. As part of this extension arrangement, the Company contributed 795,503 treasury shares to CSF I as additional collateral to maintain a blended interest rate in the CSF I facility of approximately 7.5%. Accordingly, the amount due at maturity in June 2010 for the CSF I notes and preferred interests will be $248 million. In August 2008, the Company amended the CSF I notes and preferred interests to early settle the CSF I CAGR. Accordingly, NRG made a cash payment of $45 million to CS for the benefit of CSF I, which was recorded to interest expense in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. Asset Sales ITISA On April 28, 2008, NRG completed the sale of its 100% interest in Tosli, which held all NRGs interest in ITISA, to Brookfield Renewable Power Inc. (previously Brookfield Power Inc.), a wholly owned subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. In addition, the purchase price adjustment contingency under the sale agreement was resolved on August 7, 2008. In connection with the sale, NRG received $300 million of cash proceeds from Brookfield, and removed $163 million of assets, including $59 million of cash, $122 million of liabilities, including $63 million of debt, and $15 million in foreign currency translation adjustment from its 2008 consolidated balance sheet. As discussed in Note 3, Discontinued Operations, Business Acquisitions and Dispositions, the activities of Tosli and ITISA have been classified as discontinued operations. USES OF FUNDS The Companys requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) commercial operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations; (iii) capital expenditures including RepoweringNRG and environmental; and (iv) corporate financial transactions including return of capital to shareholders. Commercial Operations NRGs commercial operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) initial collateral required to establish trading relationships; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (i.e., buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); and (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions. As of December 31, 2008, commercial operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $492 million, and $283 million outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its economic hedging activities. As of December 31, 2008, total collateral held from counterparties was $788 million, including $6 million of restricted cash, and $28 million of letters of credit. Future liquidity requirements may change based on the Companys hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on NRGs credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness. Debt Service Obligations NRG must annually offer a portion of its excess cash flow (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility) to its first lien lenders under the Term Loan Facility. The percentage of excess cash flow offered to these lenders is dependent upon the Companys consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility) at the end of the preceding year. Of the amount offered, the first lien lenders must accept 50% while the remaining 50% may either be accepted or rejected at the lenders option. Based on current credit market conditions the Company expects that its lenders will accept in full the mandatory offer required for 2008, and, as such, the Company has reclassified approximately 112 Table of Contents $197 million of Term Loan Facility maturity from a non current to a current liability as of December 31, 2008. The mandatory annual offer required for 2007 was $446 million, against which the Company made a $300 million prepayment in December 2007. With this prepayment, the Company met a financial ratio by the end of 2007 that resulted in a 0.25% reduction in the interest rate on both its Term Loan Facility and Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility which resulted in approximately $8 million in pre tax interest savings during 2008. Of the remaining $146 million, the lenders accepted a repayment of $143 million in March 2008. The amount retained by the Company was used for investments, capital expenditures and other items as defined by the Senior Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2008, NRG had approximately $4.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured high yield notes or Senior Notes, had approximately $2.6 billion in principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, and had issued $440 million of letters of credit under the Companys $1.3 billion Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on February 2, 2011 and the Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility matures on February 1, 2013. Principal payments on debt and capital leases as of December 31, 2008 are due in the following periods: Subsidiary/Description 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In millions) Debt: 7.375% Notes due 2017 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1,100 $ 1,100 7.25% Notes due 2014 1,200 1,200 7.375% Notes due 2016 2,400 2,400 Term Loan Facility, due 2013 228 32 31 32 2,319 2,642 CSF notes and preferred interests, due 2009 and 2010 143 190 333 NRG Energy Center Minneapolis LLC, due 2013 and 2017 11 11 12 13 10 27 84 Nuclear Innovation North America LLC, due 2011 10 10 NRG Repowering Holdings LLC, due 2011 10 10 NRG Peaker Finance Co.

The following table summarizes the Companys capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2008 and the estimated capital expenditure and repowering investments forecast for 2009. Maintenance Environmental Repowering Total (In millions) Northeast $ 32 $ 157 $ 19 $ 208 Texas 115 26 97 238 South Central 9 5 14 West 5 30 35 Wind 398 398 NINA 101 101 Other 21 21 Total $ 182 $ 188 $ 645 $ 1,015 Estimated capital expenditures for 2009 $ 255 $ 256 $ 256 $ 767 RepoweringNRG capital expenditures and investments RepoweringNRG project capital expenditures consisted of approximately $218 million for wind turbines and construction related costs for the Elbow Creek wind farm project which became commercially operational in December 2008 and $180 million in turbine purchases for other wind projects currently under development. In addition, the Companys RepoweringNRG capital expenditures included $97 million related to the construction of Cedar Bayou Unit 4 in Texas, $101 million related to the development of STP Units 3 and 4 in Texas, $30 million for the repowering of the El Segundo generating station in California, and $19 million for the construction of Cos Cob in Connecticut. The Companys estimated repowering capital expenditures for 2009 are expected to be approximately $256 million, of which capital expenditures related to STP units 3 and 4 will be approximately $145 million, the construction of Cedar Bayou Unit 4 anticipated to be approximately $22 million, and the balance of the Companys repowering capital expenditures related to the purchase of additional wind turbines. The Company also anticipates receiving approximately $145 million in third party equity investments related to its RepoweringNRG projects in 2009. Related to RepoweringNRG, the Company contributed equity of approximately $84 million to its Sherbino wind farm joint venture project with BP in 2008 which became commercially operational in October 2008. Major maintenance and environmental capital expenditures The Companys baghouse project at its Huntley and Dunkirk plants resulted in environmental capital expenditures of $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Other capital expenditures included $44 million for STP fuel and $71 million in maintenance capital expenditures in Texas primarily related to the W.A. Parish and Limestone plants. NRG anticipates funding these maintenance capital projects primarily with funds generated from operating activities. The Company is also pursuing funding for certain environmental expenditures in the Northeast region through Solid Waste Disposal Bonds utilizing tax exempt financing, and expects to draw upon such funds during 2009. Loans to affiliates During 2008 the Company loaned approximately $36 million in funds to GenConn Energy LLC, a 50/50 joint venture vehicle of NRG and the United Illuminating Company as a part of the Devon and Middletown plant projects. These loans, which are in the form of an interest bearing note, mature in 2009, at which point GenConn Energy LLCs construction costs are expected to be funded through equity of NRG and the United Illuminating Company and non recourse project level financing. 114 Table of Contents Environmental Capital Expenditures Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated that environmental capital expenditures to be incurred from 2009 through 2013 to meet NRGs environmental commitments will be approximately $1.2 billion. These capital expenditures, in general, are related to installation of particulate, SO2, NOx, and mercury controls to comply with federal and state air quality rules and consent orders, as well as installation of Best Technology Available under the Phase II 316(b) rule. NRG continues to explore cost effective alternatives that can achieve desired results. While this estimate reflects schedules and controls to meet anticipated reduction requirements, the full impact on the scope and timing of environmental retrofits cannot be determined until issuance of final rules by the USEPA. The following table summarizes the estimated environmental capital expenditures for the referenced periods by region: Texas Northeast South Central Total 2009 $ $ 256 $ $ 256 2010 8 213 57 278 2011 17 175 116 308 2012 29 67 114 210 2013 21 3 74 98 Total $ 75 $ 714 $ 361 $ 1,150 Capital Allocation 2008 Capital Allocation Plan In December 2007, the Company initiated its 2008 Capital Allocation Plan, with the repurchase of 2,037,700 shares of NRG common stock during that month for approximately $85 million. In February 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized an additional $200 million in common share repurchases that raised the total 2008 Capital Allocation Plan to approximately $300 million. In the first quarter 2008, the Company repurchased 1,281,600 shares of NRG common stock for approximately $55 million. In the third quarter 2008, the Company repurchased an additional 3,410,283 of NRG common stock in the open market for approximately $130 million. As of December 31, 2008, NRG had repurchased a total of 6,729,583 shares of NRG common stock at a cost of approximately $270 million as part of its 2008 Capital Allocation Plan. 2009 Capital Allocation Plan On October 30, 2008, the Company announced its 2009 Capital Allocation Plan to purchase an additional $300 million in common stock, subject to restrictions under US securities laws. As part of the 2009 plan, the Company will invest over $511 million in maintenance and environmental capital expenditures in existing assets in 2009 and $256 million in investment in projects under RepoweringNRG that are currently under construction or for which there exists current obligations. Finally, in addition to scheduled debt amortization payment, in the first quarter 2009 the Company will offer its first lien lenders $197 million of its 2008 excess cash flow (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility). Preferred Stock Dividend Payments For the year ended December 31, 2008, NRG paid approximately $29 million, $17 million and $9 million in dividend payments to holders of the Companys 5.75%, 4% and 3.625% Preferred Stock. Benefit Plans Obligations As of December 31, 2008, NRG contributed $99 million towards its three defined benefit pension plans to meet the Companys 2008 benefit obligation, $35 million of which was to partially fund the plans as a result of the weak market performance of plan assets in 2008. Based on the Companys December 31, 2008 measurement of its benefit obligation for its three defined benefit pension plans, the Company is expected to contribute another $60 million to these plans during 2009, $29 million of which also relates to the Companys 2008 benefit obligation. 115 Table of Contents Cash Flow Discussion 2008 compared to 2007 The following table reflects the changes in cash flows for the comparative years; all cash flow categories include the cash flows from both continuing operations and discontinued operations: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,434 $ 1,517 $ (83 ) Net cash used by investing activities (672 ) (327 ) (345 ) Net cash used by financing activities (442 ) (814 ) 372 Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $83 million compared to the same period in 2007. The difference was due to: Collateral paid In 2008, higher cash collateral paid to support the Companys hedging and trading activities decreased cash from operations by $292 million as compared to the same period in 2007. Working capital In 2008, the cash provided by working capital items increased by $196 million. Changes in option premiums collected from 2007 to 2008 classified in other current liabilities increased as a result of the deferral of option premium revenue to 2009 to match revenues with option expiration dates. Further, changes to account receivable were caused by higher energy revenues in December 2007 as compared to December 2008 and changes to accounts payable were caused by reduced maintenance expenses incurred in December 2007 as compared to December 2008. Net Cash Used By Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash used in investing activities was approximately $345 million more than the same period in 2007. This was due to: Capital expenditures NRGs capital expenditures increased by $418 million due to RepoweringNRG projects, primarily related to $398 million for wind turbines and construction activities related to Elbow Creek and other wind projects currently under development. Sale of discontinued operations Proceeds from the sale of ITISA, net of cash divested, were $241 million in 2008. Asset sales The Company received $14 million in proceeds primarily from the sale of rail cars in 2008 compared to proceeds of $57 million for the sale of Red Bluff and Chowchilla II power plants and equipment in the same period in 2007 for a net decrease in cash of $43 million. Trading of emission allowances Net purchases and sales of emission allowances resulted in a decrease in cash of $44 million for 2008 as compared to 2007. Equity Contribution The Company contributed approximately $84 million to its equity investment in Sherbino. Net Cash Used By Financing Activities For year ended December 31, 2008, net cash used by financing activities decreased by approximately $372 million compared to 2007, due to: Term Loan Facility debt payment In 2008, the Company paid down $174 million of its Term Loan Facility, including the payment of excess cash flow, as discussed above under Debt Service Obligations. The Company paid down $332 million of its Term Loan Facility during 2007 for a net cash increase of $158 million for the year ended 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. 116 Table of Contents Share repurchase During 2008, the Company repurchased approximately $185 million shares of NRG common stock, compared to $353 million for 2007 for a net $168 million increase to cash for the year ended 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Sale of minority interest The Company received $50 million in proceeds from the sale of minority interest in NINA in the first half of 2008. Payment of financing element of acquired derivatives For 2008, the Company paid approximately $43 million for the settlement of gas swaps related to the acquisition of Texas Genco in 2006. Issuance of debt During 2008 the Company received $20 million in proceeds from borrowings made by its subsidiaries. NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and FIN 48 Implications As of December 31, 2008, the Company had generated total domestic pre tax book income of $1,644 million and foreign continuing pre tax book income of $85 million. In addition, NRG has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $239 million, of which $41 million will expire starting in 2011 through 2017 and of which $198 million do not have an expiration date. In addition to these amounts, the Company has $527 million of tax effected unrecognized tax benefits which relate primarily to net operating losses for tax return purposes but have been classified as capital loss carryforwards for financial statements purposes and for which a full valuation allowance has been established. As a result of the Companys tax position, and based on current forecasts, we anticipate income tax payments of up to $100 million in 2009. However, as the position remains uncertain, of the $527 million of tax effected unrecognized tax benefits, the Company has recorded a non current tax liability of $208 million and may accrue the remaining balance as an increase to non current liabilities until final resolution with the related taxing authority. The $208 million non current tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits is due to taxable earnings for the period which there are no NOLs available to offset for financial statement purposes. The Company has been contacted for examination by the Internal Revenue Service for years 2004 through 2006. The audit commenced during the third quarter 2008 and is expected to continue for approximately 18 to 24 months. On July 6, 2007, the German government passed the Tax Reform Act of 2008, which reduces the German statutory and resulting effective tax rates on earnings from approximately 36% to approximately 27% effective January 1, 2008. Due to this reduction in the statutory and resulting effective tax rate in 2007, NRG recognized a $29 million tax benefit and as of December 31, 2007, NRG had a German net deferred tax liability of approximately $84 million which includes the impact of this tax rate change. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Obligations under Certain Guarantee Contracts NRG and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include financial and performance guarantees, stand by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. See also Item 15 Note 25, Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. Retained or Contingent Interests NRG does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. 117 Table of Contents Derivative Instrument Obligations On August 11, 2005, NRG issued 3.625% Preferred Stock that includes a feature which is considered an embedded derivative per SFAS 133. Although it is considered an embedded derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting as it is excluded from the scope pursuant to paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133. As of December 31, 2008, based on the Companys stock price, the embedded derivative was out of the money and had no redemption value. See also Item 15 Note 13, Capital Structure, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. On October 13, 2006, NRG, through its unrestricted wholly owned subsidiaries CSF I and CSF II issued notes and preferred interests for the repurchase of NRGs common stock. Included in each agreement was a feature considered an embedded derivative per SFAS 133. Although it is considered a derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting as it is excluded from the scope pursuant to paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133. In August 2008, the Company amended the CSF I notes and preferred interests to early settle the CSF I embedded derivative. Accordingly, NRG made a cash payment of $45 million to CS for the benefit of CSF I, which was recorded to interest expense in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2008, based on the Companys stock price, the CSF II embedded derivative was out of the money and had no redemption value. See also Item 15 Note 11, Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. Obligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity Variable interest in Equity investments As of December 31, 2008, NRG has several investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy related entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. One of these investments, GenConn Energy LLC, is a variable interest entity for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary. NRGs pro rata share of non recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $135 million as of December 31, 2008. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to NRG. See also Item 15 Note 14, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. Letter of Credit Facilities The Companys $1.3 billion Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility is unfunded by NRG and is secured by a $1.3 billion cash deposit at Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch that was funded using proceeds from the Term Loan Facility investors who participated in the facility syndication. Under the Synthetic Letter of Credit Facility, NRG is allowed to issue letters of credit for general corporate purposes including posting collateral to support the Companys commercial operations activities. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NRG has a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to the Companys capital expenditure programs. The following tables summarize NRGs contractual obligations and contingent obligations for guarantee. See also Item 15 Note 11, Debt and Capital Leases, Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 25, Guarantees , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. 118 Table of Contents By Remaining Maturity at December 31, 2008 Under Over 2007 Contractual Cash Obligations 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total(b) Total (In millions) Long term debt (including estimated interest) $ 858 $ 1,316 $ 3,267 $ 5,701 $ 11,142 $ 12,301 Capital lease obligations (including estimated interest) 87 37 25 172 321 390 Operating leases 43 79 62 193 377 420 RepoweringNRG project commitments 27 27 352 Fuel purchase and transportation obligations(a) 1,513 477 182 206 2,378 3,203 Pension minimum funding requirement(c) 65 95 34 194 196 Other postretirement benefits minimum funding requirement(d) 4 11 4 19 15 Total $ 2,597 $ 2,015 $ 3,574 $ 6,272 $ 14,458 $ 16,877 (a) Includes only those coal transportation and lignite commitments for 2009 as no other nominations were made as of December 31, 2008.

In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the Companys variable rate and fixed rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements. NRGs trading activities include contracts entered into to profit from market price changes as opposed to hedging an exposure, and are subject to limits in accordance with the Companys risk management policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial 119 Table of Contents instruments are recognized in earnings. These trading activities are a complement to NRGs energy marketing portfolio. The tables below disclose the activities that include both exchange and non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; identify changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2008, based on whether fair values are determined by quoted market prices or more subjective means; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2008. Derivative Activity Gains/(Losses) (In millions) Fair value of contracts as of December 31, 2007 $ (492 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period 162 Changes in fair value 1,326 Fair value of contracts as of December 31, 2008 $ 996 Fair Value of Contracts as of December 31, 2008 Maturity Maturity Less Than Maturity Maturity in Excess Total Fair Sources of Fair Value Gains/(Losses) 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 4 5 Years Value (In millions) Prices actively quoted $ (32 ) $ 14 $ $ $ (18 ) Prices provided by other external sources 614 114 283 (46 ) 965 Prices provided by models and other valuation methods 37 12 49 Total $ 619 $ 140 $ 283 $ (46 ) $ 996 A small portion of NRGs contracts are exchange traded contracts with readily available quoted market prices. The majority of NRGs contracts are non exchange traded contracts valued using prices provided by external sources, primarily price quotations available through brokers or over the counter and on line exchanges. For the majority of NRG markets, the Company receives quotes from multiple sources. To the extent that NRG receives multiple quotes, the Companys prices reflect the average of the bid ask mid point prices obtained from all sources that NRG believes provide the most liquid market for the commodity. If the Company receives one quote then the mid point of the bid ask spread for that quote is used. The terms for which such price information is available vary by commodity, region and product. The remainder of the assets and liabilities represent contracts for which external sources or observable market quotes are not available. These contracts are valued based on various valuation techniques including but not limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. Contracts valued with prices provided by models and other valuation techniques make up 5% of the total fair value of all derivative contracts. The fair value of each contract is discounted using a risk free interest rate. In addition, the Company applies a credit reserve to reflect credit risk which is calculated based on published default probabilities. To the extent that NRGs net exposure under a specific master agreement is an asset, the Company is using the counterpartys default swap rate. If the exposure under a specific master agreement is a liability, the Company is using NRGs default swap rate. The credit reserve is added to the discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market participant would be willing to receive to assume NRGs liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay for NRGs assets. As of December 31, 2008 the credit reserve resulted in a $22 million decrease in fair value which is composed of a $10 million gain in other comprehensive income, or OCI, and a $12 million gain in derivative revenue. The fair values in each category reflect the level of forward prices and volatility factors as of December 31, 2008 and may change as a result of changes in these factors. Management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts NRG holds and sells. These estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit exposure. It is possible however, that future market prices could vary from those used in recording assets and liabilities from energy marketing and trading activities and such variations could be material. 120 Table of Contents The Company has elected to disclose derivative activity on a trade by trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Companys portfolio. As discussed in Item 7A Commodity Price Risk, NRG measures the sensitivity of the Companys portfolio to potential changes in market prices using Value at Risk, or VAR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. NRGs risk management policy places a limit on one day holding period VAR, which limits the Companys net open position. As the Companys trade by trade derivative accounting results in a gross up of the Companys derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of our hedging activity. As of December 31, 2008, NRGs net derivative asset was $996 million, an increase to total fair value of $1,488 million as compared to December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily driven by decreases in gas and power prices as well as the roll off of trades that settled during the period. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates NRGs discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed. On an ongoing basis, NRG evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Companys estimates. Any effects on the Companys business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. NRGs significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Companys financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting Policy Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application Derivative Financial Instruments Assumptions used in valuation techniques Assumptions used in forecasting generation Market maturity and economic conditions Contract interpretation Market conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commitments Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets Ability of tax authority decisions to withstand legal challenges or appeals Anticipated future decisions of tax authorities Application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions 121 Table of Contents Accounting Policy Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application Ability to utilize tax benefits through carrybacks to prior periods and carryforwards to future periods Impairment of Long Lived Assets Recoverability of investment through future operations Regulatory and political environments and requirements Estimated useful lives of assets Environmental obligations and operational limitations Estimates of future cash flows Estimates of fair value (fresh start) Judgment about triggering events Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Estimated useful lives for finite lived intangible assets Judgment about impairment triggering events Estimates of reporting units fair value Fair value estimate of certain power sales and fuel contracts using forward pricing curves as of the closing date over the life of each contract Contingencies Estimated financial impact of event(s) Judgment about likelihood of event(s) occurring Regulatory and political environments and requirements Derivative Financial Instruments The Company follows the guidance of SFAS 133, to account for derivative financial instruments. SFAS 133 requires the Company to mark to market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet, and recognize changes in the fair value of non hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. In certain cases, NRG may apply hedge accounting to the Companys derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure, (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives instruments accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item, or deferred and recorded as a component of OCI, and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur. For purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, NRG uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes. When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models to determine the fair value. These internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. In order to qualify derivative instruments for hedged transactions, NRG estimates the forecasted generation occurring within a specified time period. Judgments related to the probability of forecasted generation occurring are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation, and historical physical delivery on similar contracts. The probability that hedged forecasted generation will occur by the end of a specified time period could change the results of operations by requiring amounts currently classified in OCI to be reclassified into earnings, creating increased variability in our earnings. These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates. 122 Table of Contents Certain derivative financial instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered Normal Purchase and Normal Sales, or NPNS. The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that NRG has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation, and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment, and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings. Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets As of December 31, 2008, NRG had a valuation allowance of approximately $359 million. This amount is comprised of U.S. domestic capital loss carryforwards and non depreciable property of approximately $292 million, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $66 million and foreign capital loss carryforwards of approximately $1 million. In assessing the recoverability of NRGs deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon projected capital gains and available tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2007, cumulative net operating losses of $245 million had been fully utilized with the exception of state NOLs. The utilization of the Companys NOLs depends on several factors, such as NRGs ability to utilize tax benefits through carryforwards to future periods, the application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions. NRG continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions. Considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. NRG is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including major operations located in Germany and Australia. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2002. With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2003. The Companys significant foreign operations are also no longer subject to examination by local jurisdictions for years prior to 2000. Evaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other Than Temporary Decline in Value In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, or SFAS 144, NRG evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are: Significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset; Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition; Adverse business climate; Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset; Current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and Change in the Companys intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation 123 Table of Contents techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs, and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Companys estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material. For assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value under SFAS 144, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held for sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature subjective. NRG considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence of such information, the Company may consider prices of similar assets, consult with brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. NRG will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability weights a range of possible outcomes. The use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in the Companys estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were reductions of $23 million and $11 million, respectively, in income from continuing operation due to impairment of an investment in commercial paper. The Company recorded these impairments as a reduction to interest income. For the year ended December 31, 2006, there was no reduction in income from continuing operations due to an impairment. NRG is also required to evaluate its equity method and cost method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired. Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, or APB18, provides the accounting requirements for these investments. The standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under APB 18 is whether the value is considered an other than a temporary decline in value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under APB 18 involves the same uncertainties as described for long lived assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with SFAS 144. Similarly, the estimates that NRG makes with respect to its equity and cost method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which the Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of SFAS 144, NRG would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other than temporary decline in value under APB 18. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets As part of the acquisition of Texas Genco, NRG recorded goodwill and intangible assets at its Texas segment reporting unit. The Company applied SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, or SFAS 141, and SFAS 142 to account for these intangibles. Under these standards, the Company amortizes all finite lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. However, goodwill and all intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairments at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, where necessary the Companys goodwill and or intangible asset with indefinite lives will be impaired at that time. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2008 for its Texas reporting unit, which is at the operating segment level. The impairment assessment included both income and 124 Table of Contents market approaches, represented by discounted cash flow and earnings multiple methodologies that considered the following: Income approach a discounted cash flow valuation for the regions major solid fuel baseload plants that utilized the Companys six year budget data and a market derived earnings multiple terminal value, with such terminal value assessed for reasonableness by capitalizing the final years cash flow with adjustments for expected inflation; a discounted cash flow valuation for the tax benefit associated with the amortization of tax basis of the regions intangible assets; a market approach valuation of the regions gas plants using market derived earnings multiples of comparable power generators, with adjustments for the regions expected capital expenditure requirements; Market approach an overall market approach reasonableness test that reconciled NRGs current market value based upon the average percent of total company value represented by NRG Texas, as measured by four different earnings measures, each calculated over three different historical time periods. This market approach reasonableness test also considered sensitivity testing under a number of different implied control premium scenarios, including one with no premium. The income approach methodologies were consistent with the approach for determining fair value at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Significant assumptions and judgments impacting the Companys goodwill impairment assessment included managements projections of operating results and capital expenditure requirements, risk adjusted discount rates, market performance, and other factors. Under all methodologies, the calculated NRG Texas equity value exceeded the NRG Texas book value, and the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2008. In connection with the Texas Genco acquisition, the Company recognized the estimated fair value of certain power sale contracts and fuel contracts acquired. NRG estimated their fair value using forward pricing curves as of the closing date of the acquisition over the life of each contract. These contracts had net negative fair values at the closing date of the acquisition and were reflected as assumed contracts in the consolidated balance sheets. Assumed contracts are amortized to revenues and fuel expense as applicable based on the estimated realization of the fair value established on the closing date over the contractual lives. Contingencies NRG records a loss contingency when management determines it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Developments See Item 15 Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments. 125 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk NRG is exposed to several market risks in the Companys normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with the Companys merchant power generation or with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transaction. The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk and currency exchange risk. In order to manage these risks the Company uses various fixed price forward purchase and sales contracts, futures and option contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps and options traded in the over the counter financial markets to: Manage and hedge fixed price purchase and sales commitments; Manage and hedge exposure to variable rate debt obligations; Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices; and Hedge fuel requirements for the Companys generating facilities. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices, volatility in commodities, and correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal, oil, and emissions credits. A number of factors influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products. These factors include: Seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand; Extreme peak demands due to weather conditions; Available supply resources; Transportation availability and reliability within and between regions; and Changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations. As part of NRGs overall portfolio, NRG manages the commodity price risk of the Companys merchant generation operations by entering into various derivative or non derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of electricity and purchases of fuel. These instruments include forwards, futures, swaps, and option contracts traded on various exchanges, such as New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, and Chicago Climate Exchange, or CCX, as well as over the counter financial markets. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon managements assessment of market, weather, operation and other factors. While some of the contracts the Company uses to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources, other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices, contract quantities, or both. NRG uses the Companys best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts held and sold. These estimates consider various factors, including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit exposure. However, it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording mark to market derivative instrument valuation, and such variations could be material. NRG measures the risk of the Companys portfolio using several analytical methods, including sensitivity tests, scenario tests, stress tests, position reports, and Value at Risk, or VAR. VAR is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. Currently, the company estimates VAR using a Monte Carlo simulation based methodology. NRGs total portfolio includes mark to market and non mark to market energy assets and liabilities. NRG uses a diversified VAR model to calculate an estimate of the potential loss in the fair value of the Companys energy assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, load obligations, and bilateral physical and financial transactions. The key assumptions for the Companys diversified model include: (i) a lognormal 126 Table of Contents distribution of prices, (ii) one day holding period, (iii) a 95% confidence interval, (iv) a rolling 36 month forward looking period, and (v) market implied volatilities and historical price correlations. As of December 31, 2008, the VAR for NRGs commodity portfolio, including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions calculated using the diversified VAR model was $43 million. The following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VAR for NRG for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: VAR In millions As of December 31, 2008 $ 43 Average 50 Maximum 65 Minimum 35 As of December 31, 2007(a) $ 64 Average 28 Maximum 64 Minimum 14 (a) Prior to December 4, 2007, NRGs VAR measurement was based on a rolling 24 month forward looking period Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as VAR, the evolving nature of the competitive markets for electricity and related derivatives, and the seasonality of changes in market prices, the VAR calculation may not capture the full extent of commodity price exposure. As a result, actual changes in the fair value of mark to market energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated VAR, and such changes could have a material impact on the Companys financial results. In order to provide additional information for comparative purposes to NRGs peers, the Company also uses VAR to estimate the potential loss of derivative financial instruments that are subject to mark to market accounting. These derivative instruments include transactions that were entered into for both asset management and trading purposes. The VAR for the derivative financial instruments calculated using the diversified VAR model as of December 31, 2008, for the entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset management and trading, was approximately $35 million primarily driven by asset backed transactions. Interest Rate Risk NRG is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through the Companys issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument. NRGs risk management policies allow the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations. In January 2006, the Company entered into a series of new interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps became effective on February 15, 2006, and are intended to hedge the risk associated with floating interest rates. For each of the interest rate swaps, NRG pays its counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest payment on a predetermined notional value, and NRG receives the equivalent of a floating interest payment based on a 3 month LIBOR rate calculated on the same notional value. All interest rate swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made quarterly, and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period. While the notional value of each of the swaps does not vary over time, the swaps are designed to mature sequentially. The total notional amount of these swaps as of December 31, 2008 was $1.9 billion. 127 Table of Contents The maturities and notional amounts of each tranche of these swaps in connection with the Senior Credit Facility are as follows: Maturity Notional Value March 31, 2009 $ 150 million March 31, 2010 $ 190 million March 31, 2011 $ 1.55 billion In addition to those listed above, the Company had the following additional interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2008: Notional Value Maturity Floating to fixed interest rate swap for NRG Peaker Financing LLC $ 266 million June 10, 2019 Fixed to floating interest rate swap for Senior notes, due 2014 $ 400 million December 15, 2013 If all of the above swaps had been discontinued on December 31, 2008, the Company would have owed the counterparties approximately $156 million. Based on the investment grade rating of the counterparties, NRG believes its exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by counterparties to its hedge contracts to be insignificant. NRG has both long and short term debt instruments that subject the Company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2008, a 1% change in interest rates would result in a $12.8 million change in interest expense on a rolling twelve month basis. As of December 31, 2008, the Companys long term debt fair value was $7.5 billion and the carrying amount was $8.0 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Companys long term debt by $401 million. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of NRGs activities and in the management of the Companys assets and liabilities. NRGs liquidity management framework is intended to maximize liquidity access and minimize funding costs. Through active liquidity management, the Company seeks to preserve stable, reliable and cost effective sources of funding. This enables the Company to replace maturing obligations when due and fund assets at appropriate maturities and rates. To accomplish this task, management uses a variety of liquidity risk measures that take into consideration market conditions, prevailing interest rates, liquidity needs, and the desired maturity profile of liabilities. Based on a sensitivity analysis, a $1 per MMBtu increase or decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the marginable contracts for power and gas positions would cause a change in margin collateral outstanding of approximately $72 million as of December 31, 2008. In addition, a 0.25 MMBtu/MWh change in heat rates for heat rate positions would result in a change in margin collateral of approximately $82 million as of December 31, 2008. This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated based on portfolio composition and margin related contract provisions as of December 31, 2008. Under the second lien, NRG is required to post certain letter of credits as credit support for changes in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2008, $19 million in letters of credit are outstanding to second lien counterparties. With changes in commodity prices, the letters of credit could grow to $87 million, the cap under the agreements. Credit Risk Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non performance or non payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process, (ii) a daily monitoring of counterparties credit limits, (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, credit derivatives or prepayment 128 Table of Contents arrangements, (iv) the use of payment netting agreements, and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk with a diversified portfolio of counterparties, including ten participants under its first and second lien structure. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at NRG to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle. A sharp economic downturn in the US and overseas markets during the latter part of 2008 was prompted by a combination of factors: tight credit markets, speculation and fear over the health of the US and global financial systems, and weaker economic activity in general prompting fears of an economic recession. Under the current market dynamics, the Company has heightened its management and mitigation of counterparty credit risk by using credit limits, netting agreements, collateral thresholds, volumetric limits and other mitigation measures, where available. NRG avoids concentration of counterparties whenever possible and applies credit policies that include an evaluation of counterparties financial condition, collateral requirements and the use of standard agreements that allow for netting and other security. As of December 31, 2008, total credit exposure to substantially all counterparties was $2.0 billion and NRG held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of $788 million resulting in a net exposure of $1.2 billion. Total credit exposure is discounted at the risk free rate. The following table highlights the credit quality and the net counterparty credit exposure by industry sector. Net counterparty credit risk is defined as the aggregate net asset position for NRG with counterparties where netting is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark to market and normal purchase and sale and non derivative transactions. The exposure is shown net of collateral held, and includes amounts net of receivables or payables. Net Exposure(a) Category (% of Total) Coal producers 16 % Financial institutions 58 Utilities, energy, merchants and marketers 21 ISOs 5 Total as of December 31, 2008 100 % Net Exposure(a) Category (% of Total) Investment grade 81 % Non Investment grade 8 Non rated 11 Total as of December 31, 2008 100 % (a) Credit exposure excludes California tolling, uranium, coal transportation/railcar leases, New England Reliability Must Run, cooperative load contracts and Texas Westmoreland coal contracts. NRG has credit risk exposure to certain counterparties representing more than 10% of total net exposure and the aggregate of such counterparties was $241 million. No counterparty represents more than 20% of total net credit exposure. Approximately 80% of NRGs positions relating to credit risk roll off by the end of 2011. Changes in hedge positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty concentration. NRG does not anticipate any material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any of NRGs counterparties. 129 Table of Contents Currency Exchange Risk NRG may be subject to foreign currency risk as a result of the Company entering into purchase commitments with foreign vendors for the purchase of major equipment associated with RepoweringNRG initiatives. To reduce the risks to such foreign currency exposure, the Company may enter into transactions to hedge its foreign currency exposure using currency options and forward contracts. At December 31, 2008, no foreign currency options and forward contracts were outstanding. As a result of the Companys limited foreign currency exposure to date, the effect of foreign currency fluctuations has not been material to the Companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The effects of a hypothetical simultaneous 10% appreciation in the US dollar from year end 2007 levels against all other currencies of countries in which the Company has continuing operations would result in an immaterial impact to NRGs consolidated statements of operations and approximately $58 million in pre tax unrealized income reflected in the currency translation adjustment component of OCI.
