Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The discussion and analysis below has been organized as follows: Executive Summary, including business strategy, the business environment in which NRG operates, how regulation, weather, competition and other factors affect the business, and significant events that are important to understanding the results of operations and financial condition for the 2010 period; Results of operations, including an explanation of significant differences between the periods in the specific line items of NRGs Consolidated Statements of Operations; Financial condition addressing credit ratings, liquidity position, sources and uses of cash, capital resources and requirements, commitments, and off balance sheet arrangements; and Critical accounting policies which are most important to both the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgment. As you read this discussion and analysis, refer to NRGs Consolidated Statements of Operations to this Form 10 K, which presents the results of the Companys operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, and also refer to Item I to this Form 10 K for more detailed discussion about the Companys business. Executive Summary Business Strategy NRG is engaged in the ownership, development, construction and operation of power generation facilities; the transacting in and trading of fuel and transportation services; the trading of energy, capacity and related products in the United States and select international markets; and the supply of electricity, energy services, and cleaner energy and carbon offset products to retail electricity customers in deregulated markets through its retail subsidiaries Reliant Energy and Green Mountain Energy. The Companys core business is focused on: (i) excellence in safety and operating performance of its existing operating assets; (ii) serving the energy needs of end use residential, commercial and industrial customers in our core markets; (iii) optimal hedging of baseload generation and retail load operations, while retaining optionality on the Companys gas fleet; (iv) repowering of power generation assets at existing sites and reducing environmental impacts; (v) pursuit of selective acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures and investments; and (vi) engaging in a proactive capital allocation plan focused on achieving the regular return of and on shareholder capital within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management. In addition, the Company believes that it is well positioned to capture the opportunities arising out of a long term societal trend towards sustainability as a result of technological developments and new product offerings in "green" energy. The Companys initiatives in this area of future growth are focused on: (i) low carbon baseload primarily nuclear generation; (ii) renewables, with a concentration in solar and wind generation and development; (iii) fast start, high efficiency gas fired capacity in the Companys core regions; (iv) electric vehicle ecosystems; and (v) smart grid services. 55 Table of Contents Business Environment The industry dynamics and external influences affecting the Company and the power generation industry in 2010 and for the future medium term include: Consolidation There were several mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. power sector in 2010. Over the long term, industry consolidation is expected to continue. Environmental Landscape A number of regulations that could significantly impact the power generation industry are in development or under review by the U.S. EPA: CAIR/CATR, NSPS for GHGs, MACT, NAAQS revisions, coal combustion byproducts, and once through cooling. While most of these regulations have been considered for some time, they are expected to gain clarity in 2011 through 2012. The timing and stringency of these regulations will provide a framework for the retrofit of existing fossil plants and deployment of new, cleaner technologies in the next decade. The Company has included capital to meet anticipated CAIR Phase I and II, proposed CATR, MACT standards for mercury, and the installation of BTA under the 316(b) Rule in the current estimated environmental capital expenditure. The Company cannot predict the impact of future regulations and could face additional investments over time. However, NRG believes it is positioned to meet more stringent requirements through its planned capital expenditures, existing controls, and the use of Powder River Basin coal. Public Policy Support and Government Financial Incentives for Clean Infrastructure Development Policy mechanisms including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, renewable portfolio standards, or RPS, and carbon trading plans have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable generation, demand side and smart grid, nuclear, and other clean infrastructure technologies. The availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics of the Companys development program and expansion into clean energy investments. Natural Gas Market The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates power plants. Natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas consumers and producers. In 2010, settled natural gas prices were higher compared to 2009, but remain below levels experienced in 2008 and earlier as supply continued to reflect increased production from low extraction cost resources, particularly the shale basins. The supply chain has pressured forward prices, which decreased from 2009 to 2010. The Company expects rebalancing of the natural gas market to be driven primarily by the supply roll off of producer hedges, reduced availability of financing to support drilling incremental wells, and strong gas demand growth from the power sector when proposed environmental regulations induce widespread coal fired power plant retirements. Electricity Price The price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the Companys generation portfolio. In 2010 prices for electricity were higher than in 2009 affected by higher prices for natural gas as well as higher electric demand due to hot summer weather in many parts of the United States and continued economic recovery. The following table summarizes average on peak power prices for each of the major markets in which NRG operates for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008: Average on Peak Power Price ($/MWh) Region 2010 2009 2008 Texas $ 40.40 $ 35.43 $ 86.23 Northeast 56.69 46.14 91.68 South Central 40.25 33.58 71.25 West 40.05 39.70 82.20 56 Table of Contents Weather Weather conditions in the regions of the United States in which NRG does business influence the Companys financial results. Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Companys results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas and oil are higher in the winter. However, all regions of North America typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG is typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once. Other Factors A number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for NRGs business. These factors include: seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand; extreme peak demands; available supply resources; transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions; location of NRGs generating facilities relative to the location of its load serving opportunities; procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations. These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in: weather conditions; market liquidity; capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems; local transportation systems; and the nature and extent of electricity deregulation. Environmental Matters, Regulatory Matters and Legal Proceedings NRG discusses details of its other environmental matters in Item 15 Note 24, Environmental Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1, Business Environmental Matters, section. NRG discusses details of its regulatory matters in Item 15 Note 23, Regulatory Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1, Business Regulatory Matters, section. NRG discusses details of its legal proceedings in Item 15 Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies, to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of this information relates to costs that may be material to the Companys financial results. Impact of inflation on NRGs results Unless discussed specifically in the relevant segment, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the impact of inflation and changing prices (due to changes in exchange rates) on NRGs revenues and income from continuing operations was immaterial. 57 Table of Contents Significant events during the year ended December 31, 2010 Results of Operations and Financial Condition Lower net income Net income decreased by 49% from $941 million to $476 million, which reflects a decrease in gross margin for Reliant Energy driven by fewer customers and price reductions, as well as a decrease in results from the wholesale power generation regions due to lower hedge prices and increased fuel and transportation costs. Liquidity position The Companys total liquidity, excluding collateral received, rose $458 million in 2010. Cash balances grew by $647 million since the end of 2009 as operating activities provided $1.6 billion of cash and the proceeds from the issuance of debt provided $1.5 billion. These increases were offset in part by $706 million of capital expenditures, $758 million in debt payments, $180 million in treasury share repurchases, and $1.0 billion in cash used for business acquisitions. Acquisition of businesses Businesses acquired during 2010 added $88 million in revenue and $48 million in cost of sales to the Companys 2010 results. For further discussion see Item 15 Note 3 Business Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long term debt In June 2010, NRG completed an amendment and extension of its Senior Credit Facility, resulting in an extension in the maturity of $1.0 billion of the outstanding Term Loan Facility to August 2015, a reduction in borrowing capacity and extension in maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility, and conversion of the synthetic letter of credit facility into an on balance sheet term loan backed funded letter of credit facility. Additionally, NRG issued $1.1 billion of 8.25% Senior Notes due 2020 in August 2010, executed a $190 million tax exempt bond financing for its Indian River plant in October 2010 and an additional $57 million in December 2010, and entered into various other financing arrangements related to business acquisitions. For further discussion see Item 15 Note 12 Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other NINA In March 2010, NINA acquired a controlling interest in the STP Units 3 and 4 Project through a settlement of the litigation with CPS. Additionally, in May 2010, TEPCO agreed to acquire up to a 20% interest in NINA Investment Holdings LLC, subject to certain conditions precedent. Further, in November 2010, NINA amended the TANE Facility to allow for additional indebtedness and entered into the Shaw Facility to finance working capital needs and the expenses of Shaw and its subsidiaries for the design, construction, engineering and services incurred in the construction of STP Units 3 and 4. See Item 15 Note 12 Debt and Capital Leases and Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 58  Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations 2010 compared to 2009 The following table provides selected financial information for NRG Energy, Inc., for the years ended December 31, 2010, and 2009: Year Ended December 31, (In millions except otherwise noted) 2010 2009 Change % Operating Revenues Energy revenue (a) $ 2,854 $ 3,726 (23 )% Capacity revenue (a) 824 1,023 (19 ) Retail revenue 5,277 4,440 19 Mark to market activities (136 ) (290 ) 53 Other revenue 30 53 (43 ) Total operating revenues 8,849 8,952 (1 ) Operating Costs and Expenses Generation cost of sales (a) 2,153 1,882 14 Retail cost of sales (a) 2,822 3,121 (10 ) Mark to market activities (111 ) (842 ) 87 Other cost of operations 1,209 1,162 4 Total cost of operations 6,073 5,323 14 Depreciation and amortization 838 818 2 Selling, general and administrative 598 550 9 Reliant Energy acquisition related transaction and integration costs 54 (100 ) Development costs 55 48 15 Total operating costs and expenses 7,564 6,793 11 Gain on sale of assets 23 N/A Operating income 1,308 2,159 (39 ) Other Income/(Expense) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 44 41 7 Gain on sale of equity method investments 128 (100 ) Other income/(expense), net 33 (5 ) N/A Refinancing expenses (20 ) (100 ) Interest expense (632 ) (634 ) Total other expense (555 ) (490 ) 13 Income before income tax expense 753 1,669 (55 ) Income tax expense 277 728 (62 ) Net Income 476 941 (49 ) Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (1 ) (1 ) Net income attributable to NRG Energy, Inc. $ 477 $ 942 (49 ) Business Metrics Average natural gas price Henry Hub ($/MMBtu) 4.39 3.92 12 % (a)Includes realized gains and losses from financially settled transactions.

The CDDs/HDDs for a period of time are calculated by adding the CDDs/HDDs for each day during the period. 60 Table of Contents Energy revenue decreased $872 million, on a consolidated basis, during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. Including intercompany sales, energy revenue for Wholesale Power Generation decreased by $47 million, due to: oNortheast decreased by $147 million, driven by a decrease of $185 million, or 22% in realized energy prices and a decrease of $32 million of margin on megawatt hours sold from market purchase for certain load contracts which expired in May 2009 and 2010. These decreases were offset by an increase of $58 million driven by new load serving contracts, which commenced June 1, 2010. In addition, generation increased by $12 million, or 1%, driven by a small increase in oil and gas plant generation offset by a small decrease in coal plant generation. This decrease in energy revenue was offset in part by: oTexas increased by $80 million, with an increase of $113 million driven by 4% higher average realized energy prices. The realized higher energy prices are a result of increased contract prices per MWh, offset in part by lower realized merchant energy such that overall energy prices increased. The increase in overall energy prices was offset by a decrease in generation of 1% or $32 million. This decrease in generation was driven by a decrease in baseload generation due to maintenance outages and a decrease in gas plant generation, offset by an increase in owned wind farm generation as Langford wind facilities began commercial operations in December 2009 and South Trent was acquired in June 2010. oSouth Central increased by $20 million due to a $70 million increase in contract revenue attributable to the regions cooperative customers from fuel cost pass through which contributed $24 million, increased volume of $14 million and an additional $32 million from a new contract with a regional municipality. These increases were offset by a $50 million decrease in merchant revenue of which $37 million is due to lower average realized prices and $13 million resulted from lower volumes. oWest increased by $5 million primarily due to incremental revenue from the commencement of operations at Blythe and an increase in realized energy prices, offset by a decrease in generation. Capacity revenue decreased $199 million, on a consolidated basis, during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. Including intercompany sales, capacity revenue for Wholesale Power Generation decreased by $230 million: oTexas decreased by $168 million due to a lower proportion of baseload contracts which contain a capacity component. Intercompany capacity revenue to Reliant Energy, which eliminate in consolidation, decreased by $31 million. oNortheast decreased by $11 million, due to a $44 million decrease in revenue from NEPOOL capacity driven by the expiration of RMR contracts for the Montville, Middletown and Norwalk plants in 2010, a decrease in capacity pricing for the winter months and lower volume of capacity sales due to the retirement of the Somerset coal facility starting January 1, 2010. This decrease was offset by a $30 million increase in capacity revenue in the NYISO market driven in part by the retirement of the New York Power Authoritys Poletti facility in January 2010. oSouth Central decreased by $34 million due to the expiration of a capacity agreement with a regional utility. oWest decreased by $9 million due to reduced resource adequacy and call option contract sales at El Segundo in 2010 as compared to 2009. 61 Table of Contents Generation cost of sales increased $271 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009: oTexas increased $191 million due to higher coal and natural gas costs, an increase in purchased energy, and higher ancillary services costs. Coal costs increased by $62 million due to a $76 million increase in transportation cost offset by a $15 million decrease related to lower volume. Natural gas costs increased $15 million, reflecting a 16% increase in average natural gas prices offset by an 8% decrease in gas fired generation. Costs of purchased energy increased by $61 million for increased obligations when baseload plants are unavailable and additional purchases for bilateral and toll energy agreements. Ancillary service costs increased by $26 million due to an increase in purchased ancillary costs incurred to meet obligations, primarily for Reliant Energy. Emission credit expense increased by $13 million reflecting a 2 to 1 increase in SO2 credits required by the amended CAIR rules as compared to the same period in 2009. ERCOT nodal fees increased by $9 million due to higher nodal surcharge to generators for the full year 2010. oNortheast increased by $85 million due to an increase in purchased energy costs, coal costs and natural gas and oil costs. Costs of purchased energy increased by $53 million related to new load serving contracts, which commenced June 1, 2010. Coal costs increased by $15 million due to a 6% increase in average prices. Natural gas costs increased by $20 million due to a 15% increase in average prices and an increase in generation. oSouth Central increased by $16 million due to an increase in natural gas costs, coal costs and transmission costs offset by lower costs of purchased energy. Natural gas costs increased by $9 million due to a 138% increase in generation resulting from the Cottonwood acquisition. Coal costs increased by $7 million due to a 5% increase in generation offset by lower average contracted prices. Transmission costs increased by $5 million due to higher volumes into and out of the MISO region. These increases in South Central were offset by: Costs of purchased energy decreased by $5 million due to a $9 million decrease in purchased capacity from Cottonwood which was acquired in November 2010 and accounted for as owned generation, offset by an increase in MWhs purchased and average prices. These increases in generation cost of sales were offset by: oWest decreased by $14 million due to a 55% decrease in natural gas consumption partially offset by a 21% increase in average natural gas prices per MMBtu. 62  Table of Contents Retail Revenues and Cost of Sales The Companys retail revenues and retail cost of sales include the results of NRGs Reliant Energy business segment, as well as the results of Green Mountain Energy for the period November 5, 2010 (acquisition date) to December 31, 2010, which is included in NRGs Corporate business segment. Reliant Energy The following is a detailed discussion of retail revenues and costs of sales for NRGs Reliant Energy business segment. (In millions except otherwise noted) Year ended December 31, 2010 Four months ended April 30, 2010 Eight months ended December 31, 2010 Eight months ended December 31, 2009 (d) Retail Revenues Mass revenues $ 3,076 $ 903 $ 2,173 $ 2,597 Commercial and Industrial revenues 1,976 640 1,336 1,592 Supply management revenues 158 56 102 251 Total retail operating revenues (a) 5,210 1,599 3,611 4,440 Retail cost of sales (b) 4,020 1,232 2,788 3,531 Total retail gross margin $ 1,190 $ 367 $ 823 $ 909 Business Metrics Electricity sales volume GWh Mass 22,255 6,089 16,166 17,152 Commercial and Industrial (a) 26,124 8,268 17,856 20,915 Average retail customers count (in thousands, metered locations) Mass 1,490 1,519 1,475 1,566 Commercial and Industrial (a) 63 64 62 68 Retail customers count (in thousands, metered locations) Mass 1,459 1,513 1,459 1,531 Commercial and Industrial (a) 62 64 62 66 Weather Metrics CDDs (c) 3,305 166 3,139 2,972 HDDs (c) 1,812 1,267 545 699 (a)Includes customers of the Texas General Land Office, for whom the Company provides services. (b)Includes intercompany purchases from the Texas region of $1,241 million, $293 million, $948 million and $409 million, respectively. (c)The CDDs/HDDs amounts are representative of the Coast and North Central Zones within the ERCOT market in which Reliant Energy serves its customer base. (d)For the period May 1, 2009, to December 31, 2009. Retail gross margin excluding gross margin of $367 million for the first four months of 2010, Reliant Energys gross margin decreased $86 million for the comparable eight month period for both years. This was due to a $215 million decrease from 18% lower Mass margins driven by lower unit margins on acquisitions and renewals and price reductions for certain customer segments as well as 6% lower Mass volumes sold driven by fewer customers. In conjunction with the CSRA unwind, out of market supply contracts were terminated and a realized loss of $89 million was reflected in 2009 margin. Also, the 2010 gross margin reflects approximately $40 million lower supply costs related to the terminated contracts. Competition and lower unit margins on acquisitions and renewals could drive lower gross margin in the future. The following table reconciles Reliant Energys retail gross margin to operating income/(loss): (In millions) Year ended December 31, 2010 Four months ended April 30, 2010 Eight months ended December 31, 2010 Eight months ended December 31, 2009 Total Retail gross margin $ 1,190 $ 367 $ 823 $ 909 Mark to market results on energy supply derivatives (49 ) (249 ) 200 794 Contract amortization, net (183 ) (79 ) (104 ) (209 ) Other operating expenses (478 ) (140 ) (338 ) (356 ) Depreciation and amortization (117 ) (39 ) (78 ) (137 ) Operating Income/(loss) $ 363 $ (140 ) $ 503 $ 1,001 63 Table of Contents Retail operating revenues increased by $770 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the eight months ended December 31, 2009. For the comparable eight month period for both years, operating revenues decreased by $829 million due to: oMass revenues excluding revenues of $903 million for the first four months of 2010, Mass revenues decreased by $424 million for the comparable eight month period for both years, with a decrease of $247 million due to lower revenue rates driven by lower revenue pricing on acquisitions and renewals consistent with competitive offers and price reductions for certain customer segments. In addition, a decrease of $166 million was due to 6% lower volumes which reflect 0.4% monthly net customer attrition in 2010 from increased competition. Net attrition in 2009 was 0.7%. Favorable weather in both periods resulted in 7% higher customer usage in 2010 and 5% in 2009 when compared to ten year normal weather. oCommercial and Industrial revenue excluding revenues of $640 million for the first four months of 2010, C&I revenues decreased by $256 million for the comparable eight month period for both years. This decrease was due to 15% lower volumes driven by fewer customers in 2010, which result from fewer new customer acquisitions and fewer contract renewals during the 2010 renewal period as the suspension of C&I contracting in late 2008 and early 2009 continued to have an impact on renewals. Retail cost of sales increased by $489 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the eight months ended December 31, 2009. For the comparable eight month period for both years, cost of sales decreased by $743 million due to: oSupply costs and financial costs of energy including intercompany purchases from the Texas region of $1,241 million and $409 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively, and excluding supply costs of $839 million for the first four months of 2010, supply costs decreased by $675 million for the comparable eight month period in both years. This decrease is due to a $579 million decrease attributed to 20% lower hedged prices, a $225 million decrease due to 11% lower volumes driven by fewer customers, and a favorable impact of $129 million, comprised of an estimated $40 million favorable impact in 2010 and an $89 million unfavorable impact in 2009 for out of market supply contracts terminated in the fourth quarter of 2009 in conjunction with the CSRA unwind. The terminated contract value for January through April 2010 was an estimated $34 million. oTransmission and distribution charges excluding transmission and distribution costs of $393 million for the first four months of 2010, transmission and distribution charges decreased by $68 million for the comparable eight month period for both years. This decrease was due to a $93 million decrease from lower volumes transported and sold to customers in 2010 compared to 2009, which was offset by a $25 million increase due to higher rates billed by CenterPoint Energy for system restoration charges from the damage caused by Hurricane Ike effective December 2009. Green Mountain Energy Green Mountain Energy recorded $69 million in retail revenues and $46 million in retail cost of sales for the period November 5, 2010, to December 31, 2010. 64 Table of Contents Mark to market Activities Mark to market activities include economic hedges that did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges, and trading activities. Total net mark to market results decreased by $577 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009.

The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same caption as the items being hedged. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the $33 million loss in operating revenue from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by a decrease in value of forward purchases and sales of natural gas and electricity due to a decrease in forward power and gas prices. The $120 million loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by a decrease in value of forward purchases of natural gas, electricity and fuel due to a decrease in forward power and gas prices. Reliant Energys $223 million gain from the roll off of acquired derivatives consists of loss positions that were acquired as of May 1, 2009, and valued using forward prices on that date. These roll off amounts were offset by realized losses at the settled prices and higher costs of physical power which are reflected in operating costs and expenses during the same period. Green Mountain Energys $13 million gain from the roll off of acquired derivatives consists of loss positions that were acquired as of November 5, 2010, and valued using forward prices on that date. These roll off amounts were offset by realized losses at the settled prices and higher costs of physical power which are reflected in operating costs and expenses during the same period. 65  Table of Contents In accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Companys financial and physical trading of energy commodities for the years ended December 31, 2010, and 2009. The unrealized financial and physical trading results are included in the mark to market activities above, while the realized financial and physical trading results are included in energy and capacity revenue. The Companys trading activities are subject to limits within the Companys Risk Management Policy. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (In millions) Trading gains/(losses) Realized $ (25 ) $ 216 Unrealized 64 (183 ) Total trading gains $ 39 $ 33 Other Revenues Reliant Energy Texas Northeast South Central West Thermal Other Total (In millions) Year Ended December 31, 2010 $ (219 ) $ 91 $ 27 $ 24 $ 2 $ 145 $ (40 ) $ 30 Year Ended December 31, 2009 $ (258 ) $ 85 $ 28 $ 23 $ 2 $ 137 $ 36 $ 53 Other revenues decreased by $23 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009. This decrease was driven by $16 million in lower contract amortization revenue primarily due to a reduction in the Texas region due to the roll off of out of market contracted energy sales valued under purchase accounting, offset partially by an increase for Reliant Energy due to an additional four months of contract amortization in 2010. In addition, other revenues decreased due to a $31 million non cash gain related to the settlement of a pre existing in the money contract with Reliant Energy that was recognized in 2009. Thermal revenue increased as a result of the acquisition of Northwind Phoenix in 2010. Other Operating Costs Reliant Energy Texas Northeast South Central West Thermal Other Total (In millions) Year Ended December 31, 2010 $ 157 $ 501 $ 287 $ 93 $ 65 $ 108 $ (2 ) $ 1,209 Year Ended December 31, 2009 $ 104 $ 511 $ 306 $ 80 $ 63 $ 101 $ (3 ) $ 1,162 Other operating costs increased $47 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, due to: Reliant Energy increased due to the additional four months of other operating costs of $49 million included in 2010. Operations and maintenance expense increased by $6 million due to the following: oSouth Central increased by $12 million as the scope and duration of planned maintenance work at the regions coal facility was greater in 2010 than in the same period in 2009. oThermal increased by $6 million relating to Northwind Phoenix expenses since the acquisition date in 2010. oTexas increased by $2 million which includes an increase in $8 million for maintenance work during baseload outages, offset by a net gain of $6 million related to several parcels of land that were sold or held for sale in 2010. These increases in operations and maintenance expense were offset by: oReliant Energy decreased by $11 million due to lower spending for external costs associated with customer activities including the call center, billing, remittance processing, and credit and collections as well as information technology costs associated with those activities. oNortheast decreased by $6 million due to decreases in normal and major maintenance of $17 million as the Indian River, Arthur Kill and Dunkirk plants had major outages in 2009, offset by asset retirements of $8 million in 2010. 66 Table of Contents These increases in other operating costs were offset by the following: Property and other taxes decreased $22 million due to the following: oNortheast decreased $8 million due to a charge in June 2009 to reflect changes in Empire Zone regulations that eliminated the Oswego plants ability to continue participation in the Empire Zone program. oReliant Energy decreased $10 million due to a decrease in gross receipts tax as a result of the decrease in retail revenues. oTexas decreased $5 million due to a refund resulting from a sales and use tax audit. Depreciation and Amortization NRGs depreciation and amortization expense increased by $20 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. An increase of $26 million was due to depreciation on the baghouse projects in western New York and additional depreciation at the Cedar Bayou plant, the Langford wind facilities and the Blythe solar facility. Cedar Bayou began commercial operation in June 2009 and the Langford wind facilities began commercial operation in December 2009. Further, an increase of $9 million was due to amortization expense at Green Mountain Energy after the date of acquisition. This increase was offset by an overall $20 million decrease in depreciation and amortization for Reliant Energy compared to the same period in 2009. Reliant Energys depreciation and amortization expense decreased $59 million during the eight months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, which relates primarily to the amortization expense related to Mass customer relationships valued under purchase accounting which is recognized as the underlying contracts roll off. This decrease at Reliant Energy was offset by $39 million of additional depreciation and amortization expense for the first four months of 2010. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $48 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. Excluding $68 million of additional expense for Reliant Energy in the first four months of 2010, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $20 million, due to: A decrease in bad debt expense of $20 million due to decreased revenues and improved customer payment behavior. Prior year non recurring costs related to Exelons exchange offer and proxy contest efforts of $31 million. These decreases were offset by: Green Mountain Energys costs of $10 million incurred since the acquisition date. The contribution of $8 million in funding for the Reliant Energy Charitable Foundation which was created in 2010. An increase in $8 million in professional services for various on going projects in 2010. Reliant Energy Acquisition Related Transaction and Integration Costs NRG incurred Reliant Energy acquisition related transaction and integration costs of $54 million for 2009. These integration efforts were completed by the end of 2009. 67 Table of Contents Development Costs Development costs increased $7 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009 due to increased costs incurred primarily on NRG Solar development projects. Gain on Sale of Assets On January 11, 2010, NRG sold Padoma to Enel, recognizing a gain on sale of $23 million. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates NRGs equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased by $3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. The 2010 results included increased equity earnings of $15 million from Sherbino, which related to the fair value of a hedge, and $7 million from Gladstone. In 2009, NRG recognized equity earnings of $15 million from MIBRAG, which was sold in June 2009. Gain on Sale of Equity Method Investments and Other Income/(Loss), Net NRGs gain on sale of equity method investments in 2009 represents a $128 million gain on the sale of NRGs 50% ownership interest in MIBRAG. Other Income/(Expense), Net NRGs other income, net increased $38 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009 principally due to foreign exchange transactions. The 2010 amount included $5 million and $9 million of unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains, respectively. The 2009 amount included a $24 million loss on a forward contract for foreign currency executed to hedge the sale proceeds from the MIBRAG sale in 2009. Refinancing Expenses In 2009, NRG incurred a $20 million expense associated with the CSRA unwind with Merrill Lynch. Interest Expense NRGs interest expense decreased by $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009 due to the following: (In millions) Increase/(decrease) in interest expense Increase for 2020 Senior Notes issued in August 2010 $ 33 Increase for 2019 Senior Notes issued in June 2009 25 Decrease due to settlement of the CSF Debt in 2009 and early 2010 (26 ) Decrease in fees incurred on the CSRA facility (26 ) Decrease in capitalized interest 2 Decrease due to Term Loan balance reduction in 2010 (9 ) Other (1 ) Total $ (2 ) 68 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Income tax expense decreased by $451 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 2009. The effective tax rate was 36.8% and 43.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (In millions except as otherwise stated) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 753 $ 1,669 Tax at 35% 264 584 State taxes, net of federal benefit 18 23 Foreign operations (3 ) (53 ) Federal and state tax credits (7 ) Valuation allowance (34 ) 119 Expiration of capital losses 249 Reversal of valuation allowance on expired capital losses (249 ) Change in state effective tax rate (5 ) Foreign earnings 17 33 Non deductible interest 4 10 Interest accrued on uncertain tax positions 25 9 Production tax credits (11 ) (10 ) Other 4 18 Income tax expense $ 277 $ 728 Effective income tax rate 36.8 % 43.6 % The Companys effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to: Valuation Allowance The Company generated capital gains in 2010 primarily due to the derivative contracts that are treated as capital items for tax purposes. The valuation allowance is recorded primarily against capital loss carryforwards, this resulted in a decrease of $34 million in income tax expense in 2010. Tax Expense Reduction The Company recorded a lower federal and state tax expense of $325 million primarily due to lower pre tax earnings. Foreign Operations In 2010, the Company had earnings from its foreign operations that were subject to tax in the United States, resulting in an increase in tax expense of $17 million. The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740. These factors and others, including the Companys history of pre tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets. 69  Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations 2009 compared to 2008 The following table provides selected financial information for NRG Energy, Inc., for the years ended December 31, 2009, and 2008: Year Ended December 31, (In millions except otherwise noted) 2009 2008 Change % Operating Revenues Energy revenue (a) $ 3,726 $ 4,408 (15 )% Capacity revenue (a) 1,023 1,343 (24 ) Retail revenue 4,440 N/A Mark to market activities (290 ) 525 (155 ) Other revenue 53 609 (91 ) Total operating revenues 8,952 6,885 30 Operating Costs and Expenses Generation cost of sales (a) 1,882 2,576 (27 ) Retail cost of sales (a) 3,121 N/A Mark to market activities (842 ) N/A Other cost of operations 1,162 1,022 14 Total cost of operations 5,323 3,598 48 Depreciation and amortization 818 649 26 Selling, general and administrative 550 319 72 Acquisition related transaction and integration costs 54 N/A Development costs 48 46 4 Total operating costs and expenses 6,793 4,612 47 Operating income 2,159 2,273 (5 ) Other Income/(Expense) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 41 59 (31 ) Gain on sale of equity method investments 128 N/A Other income/(expense), net (5 ) 17 (129 ) Refinancing expenses (20 ) N/A Interest expense (634 ) (583 ) 9 Total other expense (490 ) (507 ) (3 ) Income from Continuing Operations before income tax expense 1,669 1,766 (5 ) Income tax expense 728 713 2 Income from Continuing Operations 941 1,053 (11 ) Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense 172 (100 ) Net Income 941 1,225 (23 ) Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (1 ) N/A Net income attributable to NRG Energy, Inc. $ 942 $ 1,225 (23 ) Business Metrics Average natural gas price Henry Hub ($/MMBtu) 3.92 8.85 (56 )% (a)Includes realized gains and losses from financially settled transactions.

Including intercompany sales to Reliant Energy, energy revenue for Wholesale Power Generation decreased by $321 million, due to: oTexas decreased $5 million as generation decreased by 2% resulting in a $44 million decrease in sales volume and as margin on MWh sold from market purchases decreased by $22 million compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease in generation was driven by a 9% decrease in coal plant generation offset by a 12% increase in gas plant generation and owned and leased wind farm generation. These increases are inclusive of the recently constructed Cedar Bayou 4 gas plant, the Elbow Creek wind farm, and the Langford wind farm which began commercial operations in June 2009, December 2008 and December 2009, respectively. Coal plant generation was adversely affected by lower energy prices driven by a 56% decrease in average natural gas prices in combination with increased wind generation in the region. These decreases were offset in part by an increase in energy prices of $39 million compared to the same period in 2008 due to the average realized energy price increasing 1%. oNortheast decreased by $203 million due to a decrease of $338 million in generation in 2009 compared to 2008, driven by a 31% decrease in coal generation and a 31% decrease in oil and gas generation. Coal generation declined 24%, or 1,471,726 MWhs, in western New York; 39%, or 1,503,975 MWhs, at Indian River; and 80%, or 476,537 MWh, at Somerset. The decline in generation at these plants was due to a combination of weakened demand for power, low merchant gas prices and higher cost of production from the introduction of RGGI resulting in increased hours where the units were uneconomic to dispatch. The decline in oil and gas generation was attributable to fewer reliability run hours at the Norwalk plant and higher maintenance work at the Arthur Kill plant in 2009. This decrease was offset by an increase in energy prices of $80 million reflecting an average 11% rise in hedged energy prices and an increase of $54 million in margin on MWh sold from market purchases driven by lower net costs incurred in meeting obligations under load serving contracts in the PJM market. oSouth Central decreased by $95 million due to a $80 million decline in contract revenue and a $15 million decrease in merchant energy revenue. The contract revenue decrease was attributed to a 10% decrease in sales volumes and a $5.15 per MWh lower average realized price. The decline in contract energy price was driven by a $16 million decrease in fuel cost pass through to the cooperatives reflecting an overall decline in natural gas prices. Also contributing to the decline in contract revenue was a $60 million decrease due to the expiration of a contract with a regional utility. The expiration of the contract allowed more energy to be sold into the merchant market, but at lower prices resulting in the $15 million decline in merchant revenue. oWest decreased by $13 million due to a 16% decrease in merchant prices in 2009 compared to 2008. This decrease was offset by a 5% increase in merchant generation in 2009 compared to 2008. Capacity revenue decreased $320 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. Including intercompany sales, capacity revenue for Wholesale Power Generation decreased by $273 million: oTexas decreased by $300 million due to a lower proportion of baseload contracts which contain a capacity component. oSouth Central increased by $36 million driven by a $40 million increase from new capacity agreements with regional utilities and a $5 million increase in capacity revenue contributed by the regions Rockford plants which dispatch into the PJM market, offset by reduced contract capacity revenue of $9 million. 72 Table of Contents Generation cost of sales decreased $694 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008 due to: oTexas decreased $305 million due to a decrease in natural gas costs and ancillary service costs, offset by an increase in coals costs. Natural gas costs decreased by $281 million due to a 56% decline in average natural gas prices offset by a 12% increase in gas fired generation. Ancillary service costs decreased by $44 million due to a decrease in purchased ancillary services costs incurred to meet contract obligations. Coal costs increased by $25 million driven by a $64 million increase in coal prices, offset by a $28 million decrease in coal volume. Additionally, an increase in higher transportation costs of $9 million was offset by a $15 million loss reserve related to a coal contract dispute in the first quarter of 2008, combined with a decrease of $3 million due to lower lignite royalties. oNortheast decreased $287 million due to a decrease in natural gas and oil costs and a decrease in coal costs, offset in part by an increase in carbon emission expense. Natural gas and oil costs decreased by $187 million, or 60%, due to 31% lower generation and 56% lower average natural gas prices. Coal costs decreased by $129 million, or 35%, due to lower coal generation of 31% accounting for $111 million and lower prices accounting for $18 million. The lower prices are due to lower fuel transportation surcharges. Carbon emission expense increased by $22 million due to the January 1, 2009, implementation of RGGI and the recognition of carbon compliance cost under this program. oSouth Central cost of energy decreased $81 million due primarily to a decline in purchased energy and a decrease in natural gas expense as well as decreases in coal and transmission expenses. Purchased energy declined by $58 million while purchased capacity rose by $3 million. The lower purchased energy was driven by lower fuel costs associated with the regions tolled facility and lower market energy prices. The energy declines were offset by increased capacity payments of $3 million on tolled facilities. Natural gas expense decreased by $15 million reflecting a 30% drop in owned gas generation and a 54% decline in gas prices. The regions gas facilities ran extensively to support transmission system stability following hurricane Gustav in September 2008. Coal expense decreased $2 million as coal generation was down 6%, offset by a 6% increase in cost per ton. Transmission expense declined by $8 million due to certain transmission line outages between electrical power regions which limited merchant energy volumes that would incur transmission costs as well as lower network interchange transmission costs associated with reduced contract customer energy volumes. 73  Table of Contents Mark to market Activities Mark to market activities include economic hedges that did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges, and trading activities. Total net mark to market results increased by $27 million in years ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. The breakdown of gains and losses included in operating revenues and operating costs and expenses by region are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 Reliant Energy (a) Texas Northeast South Central West Thermal Elimination (b) Total (In millions) Mark to market results in operating revenues Reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on settled positions related to economic hedges $ $ (73 ) $ (120 ) $ $ $ (3 ) $ $ (196 ) Reversal of gain positions acquired as part of the Reliant Energy acquisition as of May 1, 2009 (1 ) (1 ) Reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on settled positions related to trading activity (65 ) (34 ) (58 ) (157 ) Reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains due to the termination of positions related to the CSRA unwind (24 ) (24 ) Net unrealized gains/(losses) on open positions related to economic hedges 1 80 50 (17 ) 1 (1 ) 114 Net unrealized losses on open positions related to trading activity (20 ) (3 ) (3 ) (26 ) Total mark to market losses in operating revenues $ $ (102 ) $ (107 ) $ (78 ) $ $ (2 ) $ (1 ) $ (290 ) Mark to market results in operating costs and expenses Reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on settled positions related to economic hedges $ $ 47 $ 81 $ $ $ $ $ 128 Reversal of loss positions acquired as part of the Reliant Energy acquisition as of May 1, 2009 657 657 Reversal of previously recorded unrealized losses due to the termination of positions related to the CSRA unwind 104 104 Net unrealized gains/(losses) on open positions related to economic hedges 33 (55 ) (14 ) (12 ) 1 (47 ) Total mark to market gains/(losses) in operating costs and expenses $ 794 $ (8 ) $ 67 $ (12 ) $ $ $ 1 $ 842 (a)For the period May 1, 2009, to December 31, 2009. (b)Represents the elimination of the intercompany activity between the Texas and Reliant Energy regions. Mark to market results consist of unrealized gains and losses. The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same caption as the items being hedged. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the $114 million mark to market gain in operating revenue relating to economic hedges was due to an increase in value in forward sales and purchases of electricity and fuel due to a decrease in forward power and gas prices. The $47 million mark to market loss in operating costs and expenses related to economic hedges was due to an increase in value of forward purchases of electricity and natural gas relating to retail supply, offset by a decrease in value of forward fuel purchases due to a decrease in coal prices. 74 Table of Contents Reliant Energys loss positions were acquired as of May 1, 2009, and valued using forward prices on that date. The $656 million roll off amounts were offset by realized losses at the settled prices and higher costs of physical power which are reflected in operating revenues and operating costs and expenses during the same period. The $104 million gain from the reversal of a loss due to the termination of positions related to the CSRA unwind was offset by a realized loss at the settled prices and are reflected in operating costs and expenses during the same period. Since these hedging activities are intended to mitigate the risk of commodity price movements on operating revenues and operating costs and expenses, the changes in such results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather should be taken together with the effects of pricing and cost changes on operating revenue and costs. During and prior to 2009, NRG hedged a portion of the Companys 2009 through 2013 generation. During 2009, the forward power and gas prices decreased resulting in the recognition of unrealized mark to market gains. In accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Companys financial and physical trading of energy commodities for the years ended December 31, 2009, and 2008. The unrealized financial and physical trading results are included in the mark to market activities above, while the realized financial and physical trading results are included in energy and capacity revenue. The Companys trading activities are subject to limits within the Companys Risk Management Policy.

Texas decreased by $260 million due to a decrease of $198 million in contract amortization related to the roll off of out of market contracted energy sales valued under purchase accounting and a decrease of $47 million in ancillary services revenue provided to the market. Northeast decreased by $38 million due to $21 million from decreased activity in the trading of emission allowances and $16 million of lower allocations of net physical gas sales. These decreases in other revenues were offset by: Corporate recorded a $31 million non cash gain related to settlement of a pre existing in the money contract with Reliant Energy at the time of acquisition in 2009. 75 Table of Contents Other Operating Costs Reliant Energy Texas Northeast South Central West Thermal Other Total (In millions) Year Ended December 31, 2009 $ 104 $ 511 $ 306 $ 80 $ 63 $ 101 $ (3 ) $ 1,162 Year Ended December 31, 2008 $ $ 486 $ 303 $ 75 $ 51 $ 109 $ (2 ) $ 1,022 Other operating costs increased $140 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, due to: Reliant Energy increased due to the eight months of other operating costs included in 2009 totaling $104 million which consisted of $98 million for customer service operations and $55 million related to gross receipt tax on revenue, offset by $49 million in contract amortization. Contract Amortization increased $19 million in the Texas region due to a reduction in amortization for out of the money coal contracts assumed in the acquisition of Texas Genco as coal is delivered under that contract. Property and other taxes increased $17 million primarily related to a $14 million increase in the Northeast region due to a reduction in the eligibility related to Empire Zone tax credits in New York. Operations and maintenance expense increased by $10 million due to the following: oWest increased $12 million due to higher maintenance expense associated with a major overhaul at El Segundo and higher maintenance at Long Beach. oSouth Central increased $5 million due to an increase in labor costs from higher benefit costs and major maintenance due to more extensive outage work performed at the Big Cajun II plant in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. These increases in operations and maintenance expense were offset by the following decrease: oNortheast decreased $11 million due to a decrease of $22 million due to lower chemical spending and routine maintenance work as a result of lower generation and lower planned major maintenance work at the Huntley and Indian River plants, offset by a $12 million asset write down due to the cancellation of the Indian River Unit 3 air pollution control equipment project and the consequent write off of previously incurred construction costs. Depreciation and Amortization NRGs depreciation and amortization expense increased by $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. Reliant Energys depreciation and amortization expense for the eight month period was $137 million principally for amortization of customer relationships. The balance of the increase was due to depreciation on the baghouse projects in western New York and the Elbow Creek project which came online in late 2008, and the Cedar Bayou 4 plant which came online in the second quarter of 2009. 76 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $231 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008 and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6% for 2009 from 5% for 2008. The increase was due to: Reliant Energys selling, general and administrative expense totaled $203 million, including $61 million of bad debt expense incurred during the eight months ended December 31, 2009. Wage and benefits expense increased $19 million. Consultant costs increased $12 million consisting of a rise in non recurring costs related to Exelons exchange offer and proxy contest efforts of $23 million offset by a decrease in other consulting costs of $11 million. Reliant Energy Acquisition Related Transaction and Integration Costs NRG incurred Reliant Energy acquisition related transaction costs of $23 million and integration costs of $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates NRGs equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. During 2009, the Companys share in Gladstone Power Station and MIBRAG decreased by $4 million and $16 million, respectively. These decreases were offset by an $11 million increase in earnings for the Companys share of NRG Saguaro, LLC in 2009 as compared to 2008. In addition, there was a $6 million decrease in Sherbinos mark to market unrealized loss as compared to 2009 as a result of a natural gas swap executed to hedge to future power generation. Gain on Sale of Equity Method Investments and Other Income/(Loss), Net NRGs gain on sale of equity method investments was $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Other income, net decreased by $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. The 2009 amounts include a $128 million gain on the sale of NRGs 50% ownership interest in MIBRAG and a $24 million realized loss on a forward contract for foreign currency executed to hedge the proceeds from the MIBRAG sale. In addition, interest income for 2009 was reduced by $17 million as compared to 2008 due to lower interest rates. Further, in 2008, a $23 million impairment charge was recorded to restructure distressed investments in commercial paper. Refinancing Expense In 2009, NRG incurred a $20 million expense associated with the CSRA unwind with Merrill Lynch. There were no such expenses in 2008. Interest Expense NRGs interest expense increased by $51 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008 due to the following: (In millions) (Decrease)/increase in interest expense Increase for 2019 Senior Notes issued in June 2009 $ 34 Increase in fees incurred on the CSRA facility 32 Increase in amortization of deferred financing costs 8 Increase in capitalized interest 7 Increase in ineffective portion of the interest rate cash flow hedges on the Companys Term Loan Facility 4 Decrease due to Term Loan balance reduction in 2010 (33 ) Other (1 ) Total $ 51 77 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased by $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 2008. The effective tax rate was 43.6% and 40.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 (In millions except as otherwise stated) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,669 $ 1,766 Tax at 35% 584 618 State taxes, net of federal benefit 23 74 Foreign operations (53 ) (10 ) Subpart F taxable income 2 Valuation allowance 119 (12 ) Expiration of capital losses 249 Reversal of valuation allowance on expired capital losses (249 ) Change in state effective tax rate (5 ) (11 ) Foreign earnings 33 32 Non deductible interest 10 12 Interest on uncertain tax positions 9 8 Production tax credits (10 ) Other 18 Income tax expense $ 728 $ 713 Effective income tax rate 43.6 % 40.4 % The Companys effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to: Valuation Allowance The Company generated capital losses in 2009 primarily due to the derivative contracts that are treated as capital items for tax purposes. The valuation allowance is recorded primarily against capital loss carryforwards. This resulted in an increase of $129 million in income tax expense in 2009. Tax Expense Reduction The Company recorded a lower federal and state tax expense of $35 million primarily due to lower pre tax earnings. Change in state effective tax rate The Company decreased its estimated effective tax rate to 3% due to increased operational activities within the state of Texas resulting from the acquisition of Reliant Energy. This resulted in a tax benefit of $5 million. Foreign Operations The Company elected not to designate its earnings from foreign operations as permanently reinvested in 2008. In 2009, the Company sold its investment in the MIBRAG facility for a book gain of $128 million and no tax gain which resulted in minimal tax due in the local jurisdiction. The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740. These factors and others, including the Companys history of pre tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets. 78  Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Position As of December 31, 2010, and 2009, NRGs liquidity, excluding collateral received, was approximately $4.3 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, comprised of the following: As of December 31, 2010 2009 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,951 $ 2,304 Funds deposited by counterparties 408 177 Restricted cash 8 2 Total cash 3,367 2,483 Funded Letter of Credit Facility availability 440 583 Revolving Credit Facility availability 853 905 Total liquidity 4,660 3,971 Less: Funds deposited as collateral by hedge counterparties (408 ) (177 ) Total liquidity, excluding collateral received $ 4,252 $ 3,794 For the year ended December 31, 2010, total liquidity, excluding collateral received, increased by $458 million due to a higher cash balance of $647 million, partially offset by decreased availability of the Funded Letter of Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility of $143 million and $52 million, respectively. The decrease in Revolving Credit Facility availability was due to a reduction in capacity of $125 million in connection with the refinancing of the Senior Credit Facility, which was offset by an increase of $59 million due to the cancellation in February 2010 of the letter of credit issued in support of the Dunkirk bonds and an adjustment to the letter of credit issued related to the Peaker Finance Co. bonds, as described further in Item 15 Note 12, Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in cash balances are further discussed hereinafter under Cash Flow Discussion. Cash and cash equivalents and funds deposited by counterparties at December 31, 2010, are predominantly held in money market funds invested in treasury securities, treasury repurchase agreements or government agency debt. The line item "Funds deposited by counterparties" represents the amounts that are held by NRG as a result of collateral posting obligations from the Companys counterparties due to positions in the Companys hedging program. These amounts are segregated into separate accounts that are not contractually restricted but, based on the Companys intention, are not available for the payment of NRGs general corporate obligations. Depending on market fluctuation and the settlement of the underlying contracts, the Company will refund this collateral to the counterparties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the underlying trades. Since collateral requirements fluctuate daily and the Company cannot predict if any collateral will be held for more than twelve months, the funds deposited by counterparties are classified as a current asset on the Companys balance sheet, with an offsetting liability for this cash collateral received within current liabilities. The change in these amounts from December 31, 2009, was due to an increase in the forward values of hedges due to lower natural gas prices and a renegotiation of the credit limit with one counterparty. Management believes that the Companys liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance operating and maintenance capital expenditures, to fund dividends to NRGs preferred shareholders, and other liquidity commitments. Management continues to regularly monitor the Companys ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management. Credit Ratings Credit rating agencies rate a firms public debt securities. These ratings are utilized by the debt markets in evaluating a firms credit risk. Ratings influence the price paid to issue new debt securities by indicating to the market the Companys ability to pay principal, interest and preferred dividends. Rating agencies evaluate a firms industry, cash flow, leverage, liquidity, and hedge profile, among other factors, in their credit analysis of a firms credit risk. 79 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the credit ratings for NRG Energy, Inc., its Term Loan Facility and its Senior Notes as of December 31, 2010: S&P Moodys Fitch NRG Energy, Inc. BB Ba3 B+ 8.25% Senior Notes, due 2020 BB B1 BB 8.5% Senior Notes due 2019 BB B1 BB 7.375% Senior Notes, due 2016, 2017 BB B1 BB 7.25% Senior Notes due 2014 BB B1 BB Term Loan Facility BB+ Baa3 BB+ Sources of Liquidity The principal sources of liquidity for NRGs future operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived from new and existing financing arrangements, existing cash on hand and cash flows from operations. As described in Item 15 Note 12 Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Companys financing arrangements consist mainly of the Senior Credit Facility, the TANE and Shaw Facilities, the Senior Notes, project related financings and the GenConn Energy LLC related financings. In addition, NRG has granted first and second liens to certain counterparties on substantially all of the Companys assets. NRG uses the first or second lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out of the money hedge agreements for forward sales of power or MWh equivalents. To the extent that the underlying hedge positions for a counterparty are in the money to NRG, the counterparty would have no claim under the lien program. The lien program limits the volume that can be hedged, not the value of underlying out of the money positions. The first lien program does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. Within the first and second lien structure, the Company can hedge up to 80% of its baseload capacity and 10% of its non baseload assets with these counterparties for the first 60 months and then declining thereafter. Net exposure to a counterparty on all trades must be positively correlated to the price of the relevant commodity for the first lien to be available to that counterparty. The first and second lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date. The Companys lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged price. As of December 31, 2010, all hedges under the first and second liens were in the money on a counterparty aggregate basis. The following table summarizes the amount of MWs hedged against the Companys baseload assets and as a percentage relative to the Companys baseload capacity under the first and second lien structure as of December 31, 2010: Equivalent Net Sales Secured by First and Second Lien Structure (a) 2011 2012 2013 2014 In MW (b) 2,019 1,111 196 7 As a percentage of total eligible baseload capacity (c) 30 % 16 % 3 % (a)Equivalent Net Sales include natural gas swaps converted using a weighted average heat rate by region. (b)2011 MW value consists of February through December positions only. (c)Eligible baseload capacity under the first and second lien structure represents 80% of the Companys total net baseload assets. Uses of Liquidity The Companys requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) commercial operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations, as described more fully in Item 15 Note 12, Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (iii) capital expenditures including RepoweringNRG and environmental; and (iv) corporate financial transactions including return of capital to shareholders, as described in Item 15 Note 15, Capital Structure, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 80 Table of Contents Commercial Operations NRGs commercial operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) initial collateral required to establish trading relationships; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (i.e., buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); and (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions. As of December 31, 2010, commercial operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $323 million, and $689 million outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its commercial activities for both wholesale and retail transactions (includes a $66 million letter of credit relating to deposits at the PUCT that covers outstanding customer deposits and residential advance payments). As of December 31, 2010, total collateral held from counterparties was $408 million in cash, and $10 million of letters of credit. Future liquidity requirements may change based on the Companys hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on NRGs credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness. Debt Service Obligations Principal payments on debt and capital leases, including the funded letter of credit facility as of December 31, 2010, are due in the following periods: Subsidiary/Description 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In millions) Debt: Funded letter of credit $ $ $ 500 $ $ 800 $ $ 1,300 8.25% Notes due 2020 1,100 1,100 8.5% Notes due 2019 700 700 7.375% Notes due 2017 1,100 1,100 7.375% Notes due 2016 2,400 2,400 7.25% Notes due 2014 (a) 1,200 1,200 Term Loan Facility 239 26 529 10 955 1,759 NINA TANE facility due 2012 100 44 144 NINA Shaw facility due 2013 23 23 NRG Energy Center Minneapolis LLC, due 2013, 2017 and 2025 12 13 10 6 12 109 162 NRG Solar Blythe LLC, due 2028 2 1 2 1 2 21 29 Dunkirk Power LLC tax exempt bonds, due 2042 59 59 South Trent facility, due 2020 3 3 3 4 4 61 78 NRG Connecticut Peaking LLC, equity bridge loan facility 61 61 Indian River Power LLC tax exempt bonds, due 2040 and 2045 67 67 NRG Repowering Holdings LLC, due 2011 20 20 NRG Peaker Finance Co.

On January 26, 2011, NRG issued $1.2 billion of 7.625% Senior Notes due 2018, the proceeds of which were used to complete the tender offer. Through February 9, 2011, the Company redeemed $947 million of the 2014 Senior Notes, and the remaining $253 million will be called on February 25, 2011. In addition to the debt and capital leases shown in the preceding table, NRG had issued $860 million of letters of credit under the Companys $1.3 billion Funded Letter of Credit Facility and $22 million of letters of credit under the Companys Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2010. 81 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures The following tables and descriptions summarize the Companys capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2010, and the estimated capital expenditure and repowering investments forecast for 2011. RepoweringNRG capital expenditures for nuclear development RepoweringNRG project capital expenditures related to the development of STP Units 3 and 4 in Texas are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 (In millions) Capital expenditures, including accruals $ 598 Adjustments to reconcile to capital expenditures paid: Accrued liabilities related to CPS settlement (88 ) Net increase in NINAs accounts payable and accruals (114 ) Net draws on vendor credit facilities (147 ) Cash used for capital expenditures $ 249 A portion of these capital expenditures were funded by NRG equity contributions into NINA of $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, which were used both for capital expenditures and development expenses. The continued funding by NRG for the development of STP Units 3 and 4 in 2011 is dependent on successfully obtaining a loan guarantee from the U.S. DOE as well as satisfying any conditions that the loan guarantee will require. If we are successful, capital expenditures for the project in 2011 will accelerate as the project progresses, and will be funded from a number of sources, including: draws on the TANE and Shaw Facilities; equity contributions from Toshiba and its affiliates; equity contributions from TEPCO and its affiliates; and from NRG. Currently, NRG expects to invest approximately $50 million in NINA during 2011. For further discussion see Item 15 Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other segment capital expenditures capital expenditures, including accruals, for maintenance, environmental and RepoweringNRG other than nuclear development are as follows: Maintenance Environmental Repowering Total (In millions) Northeast $ 15 $ 190 $ 1 $ 206 Texas 88 88 South Central 18 18 West 11 89 100 Reliant Energy 12 12 Other 55 22 77 Total for the year ended December 31, 2010 $ 199 $ 190 $ 112 $ 501 Estimated capital expenditures for 2011 (a) $ 190 $ 183 $ 2,995 $ 3,368 (a)The Company expects to fund approximately $1.1 billion of its estimated 2011 capital expenditures from cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. RepoweringNRG capital expenditures For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Companys RepoweringNRG capital expenditures included $56 million for the Companys El Segundo project, $33 million for solar projects, and $22 million for the Companys Princeton Hospital project. In 2011, NRG will be investing in a number of solar projects and continue our efforts at El Segundo. Subject to financial close, these solar projects, for which capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $2.7 billion will be funded from a number of sources including third party partners, loan guarantees from the U.S. DOE and NRG contributions. Maintenance capital expenditures For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Companys maintenance capital expenditures included $28 million in nuclear fuel expenditures related to STP Units 1 and 2. In addition, $172 million of environmental capital expenditures for the 2010 year to date period relate to a project to install selective catalytic reduction systems, scrubbers and fabric filters on Indian River Unit 4 with an expected in service date of year end 2011. 82  Table of Contents Environmental Capital Expenditures Based on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated that environmental capital expenditures from 2011 through 2015 to meet NRGs environmental commitments will be approximately $721 million (of which $93 million will be financed through draws on the Indian River tax exempt facilities) and are primarily associated with controls on the Companys Big Cajun and Indian River facilities. These capital expenditures, in general, are related to installation of particulate, SO2, NOx, and mercury controls to comply with federal and state air quality rules and consent orders, as well as installation of BTA under the Phase II 316(b) Rule. NRG continues to explore cost effective compliance alternatives. This estimate reflects anticipated schedules and controls related to CAIR, the proposed CATR, MACT for mercury and the Phase II 316(b) Rule which are under remand to the U.S. EPA and, as such, the full impact on the scope and timing of environmental retrofits from any new or revised regulations cannot be determined at this time. The table below summarizes installed and planned air quality controls for the NRG coal fleet. Planned investments are either in construction or budgeted in the existing capital expenditures budget. Changes to regulations could result in changes to planned installation dates. NRG uses an integrated approach to fuels, controls and emissions markets to meet environmental standards.

The actual recoveries will depend, among other things, on the timing of the completion of the capital projects and the remaining duration of the contracts. 2011 Capital Allocation Program On February 22, 2011, the Company announced its 2011 Capital Allocation Plan to purchase $180 million in common stock. The Companys share repurchases are subject to market prices, financial restrictions under the Companys debt facilities, and as permitted by securities laws. As part of the 2011 plan, the Company expects to invest approximately $373 million in maintenance and environmental capital expenditures in existing assets, up to $50 million in equity contributions to NINA and approximately $3.0 billion in solar and other projects under RepoweringNRG. Investing in our large solar projects is conditional on obtaining U.S. DOE loan guarantees that will fund a large portion of the capital investments, coupled with investments by third party partners and NRG equity contributions. Finally, in addition to scheduled debt amortization payments, in the first quarter 2011 the Company will offer its first lien lenders $414 million of its 2010 excess cash flow (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility), of which the Company made a prepayment of $200 million in November 2010. Preferred Stock Dividend Payments For the year ended December 31, 2010, NRG paid $9 million in dividend payments to holders of the Companys 3.625% Preferred Stock. As of January 21, 2010, the Company completed the redemption of all remaining outstanding shares of the 4% Preferred Stock, with holders converting 154,029 preferred stock shares into 7,701,450 common stock shares and the Company redeeming 28 preferred stock shares for $28 thousand in cash. 84 Table of Contents Cash Flow Discussion The following table reflects the changes in cash flows for the comparative years; all cash flow categories include the cash flows from both continuing operations and discontinued operations: Year ended December 31, 2010 2009 Change (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,623 $ 2,106 $ (483 ) Net cash used by investing activities (1,623 ) (954 ) (669 ) Net cash provided/(used) by financing activities 651 (343 ) 994 Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities The Companys cash flow from operations was lower by approximately $483 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a $748 million decrease in operating income adjusted for non cash charges, offset by a $240 million increase in net collateral deposits paid and option premiums paid and collected and a $25 million increase in working capital. Net Cash Used By Investing Activities Changes to net cash used in investing activities were due to: Acquisition of businesses During 2010, the Company paid $1.0 billion, net of cash acquired of $75 million, to acquire several businesses. During 2009, the Company paid $427 million, of which $360 million was for the acquisition of Reliant Energy. See Item 15 Note 3, Business Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more complete description of these acquisitions. Proceeds from renewable energy grants During 2010, the Company received $102 million of federal cash grants for the Blythe solar and Langford wind facilities. Proceeds from sale of equity method investment Investing activities in 2009 reflect the sale of MIBRAG in June 2009 for net proceeds of $284 million. See Item 15 Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more complete description of this transaction. Capital expenditures NRGs capital expenditures decreased by $28 million due to decreased spending on maintenance and RepoweringNRG. Proceeds from sale of assets Net proceeds increased by $37 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to the sale of Padoma in January 2010. See Item 15 Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more complete description of this transaction. Other Investing activities in 2010 reflect $23 million invested in equity method investees, including a partnership with Eurus Energy to develop solar projects. 85 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities Changes in net cash provided by financing activities were due to: Increase in issuance of debt During 2010, the Company issued $1.3 billion under new debt facilities and $164 million under existing debt facilities. The new debt facilities consist primarily of $1.1 billion 2020 Senior Notes, $100 million by NRG Thermal, $67 million in Indian River bonds, and $30 million by Blythe. The borrowings under existing facilities related mainly to additional borrowings under the TANE facility. During 2009, the Company received $688 million in gross proceeds from the 2019 Senior Notes, $108 million in NRG Connecticut Peaking financing, $52 million from the Dunkirk bonds and $19 million from other borrowings. Increase in term loan and other facility payments In 2010, the Company paid down $453 million of its Term Loan Facility, including the payment of excess cash flow. In addition, NRG Connecticut Peaking repaid the $55 million portion of the EBL used to fund the Devon project, NRG EC Minneapolis paid $20 million on the Peakers bonds and NINA paid $20 million under its revolving credit facility. In 2009, the Company paid down $429 million of its Term Loan Facility, including the payment of excess cash flow. Repayment of CSF Debt During 2010, the Company paid $190 million in principal to early settle the CSF I Debt. In November 2009, the Company paid $181 million to CS for the benefit of CSF II to unwind the Companys CSF II Debt. Net receipt from acquired derivatives that include financing elements In 2010, the Company received a net of $137 million for the settlement of gas swaps compared with a payment of $79 million in 2009 for the settlement of gas swaps related to Reliant Energy and Texas Genco. Share repurchases During 2010, the Company repurchased $180 million of NRG common stock as compared to $500 million in 2009. Increase in deferred finance costs During 2010, deferred finance costs primarily consist of fees paid as a result of the 2020 Senior Notes and the amendment and extension of the Senior Credit Facility. During 2009, deferred finance costs were lower, and related to the Reliant Energy CSRA, the 2019 Senior Notes, the Dunkirk bonds and the Reliant Energy working capital facility. Decrease in preferred stock dividends During 2010, dividend payments on preferred stock decreased by $24 million as compared to the same period in 2009 due to the conversion of the 5.75% Preferred Stock in 2009 and the conversion of the 4% Preferred Stock, which was completed in January 2010. 86  Table of Contents NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications, under ASC 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740 As of December 31, 2010, the Company had generated total domestic pre tax book income of $691 million and foreign pre tax book income of $62 million. The Company has net operating losses for tax return purposes available to offset taxable income in the current period. In addition, NRG has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $270 million, of which $85 million will expire starting 2011 through 2018 and of which $185 million do not have an expiration date. In addition to these amounts, the Company has $663 million of tax effected uncertain tax benefits which relate primarily to net operating losses for tax return purposes which have been classified as capital loss carryforwards for financial statement purposes. As a result of the Companys tax position, and based on current forecasts, NRG anticipates income tax payments, primarily due to foreign, state and local jurisdictions, of up to $50 million in 2011. However, as the position remains uncertain for the $663 million of tax effected uncertain tax benefits, the Company has recorded a non current tax liability of $582 million and may accrue the remaining balance as an increase to non current liabilities until final resolution with the related taxing authority. The $582 million non current tax liability for uncertain tax benefits is primarily due to taxable earnings for which there are no NOLs available to offset for financial statement purposes and interest. The examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the years 2004 through 2006 is currently in Joint Committee review and is not considered effectively settled in accordance with ASC 740. The Company anticipates conclusion of the audit during 2011. Upon effective settlement of the audit, the result may be a reduction of the liability for uncertain tax benefits. The Company continues to be under examination for various state jurisdictions for multiple years. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Obligations under Certain Guarantee Contracts NRG and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include financial and performance guarantees, stand by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. See also Item 15 Note 26, Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. Retained or Contingent Interests NRG does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. Derivative Instrument Obligations The Companys 3.625% Preferred Stock includes a feature which is considered an embedded derivative per ASC 815. Although it is considered an embedded derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting as it is excluded from the scope pursuant to ASC 815. As of December 31, 2010, based on the Companys stock price, the embedded derivative was out of the money and had no redemption value. See also Item 15 Note 15, Capital Structure, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. Obligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity Variable interest in Equity investments As of December 31, 2010, NRG has several investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy related entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Two of these investments, GenConn and Sherbino, are variable interest entities for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary. NRGs pro rata share of non recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $187 million as of December 31, 2010. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to NRG. See also Item 15 Note 16, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. 87 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments NRG has a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to the Companys capital expenditure programs. The following tables summarize NRGs contractual obligations and contingent obligations for guarantee. See also Item 15 Note 12, Debt and Capital Leases, Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 26, Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the Companys variable rate and fixed rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements. NRGs trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Companys Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings. 88 Table of Contents The tables below disclose the activities that include both exchange and non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2010, based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2010. NRG also acquired retail load and supply contracts as part of business combinations in 2010, and the tables below include the fair value of these contracts receiving mark to market accounting treatment as of the acquisition date. For a full discussion of the Companys valuation methodology of its contracts, see Derivative Fair Value Measurements in Item 15 Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Derivative Activity Gains/(Losses) (In millions) Fair value of contracts as of December 31, 2009 $ 459 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (399 ) Contracts acquired in conjunction with Green Mountain Energy acquisition (60 ) Changes in fair value 672 Fair value of contracts as of December 31, 2010 $ 672 Fair Value of Contracts as of December 31, 2010 Fair value hierarchy Gains/(Losses) Maturity Less Than 1 Year Maturity 1 3 Years Maturity 4 5 Years Maturity in Excess 4 5 Years Total Fair Value (In millions) Level 1 $ 9 $ (12 ) $ (5 ) $ $ (8 ) Level 2 295 447 (1 ) (34 ) 707 Level 3 (25 ) (2 ) (27 ) Total $ 279 $ 433 $ (6 ) $ (34 ) $ 672 The Company has elected to disclose derivative assets and liabilities on a trade by trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level. Also, collateral received or paid on the Companys derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Companys portfolio. As discussed in Item 7A Commodity Price Risk, NRG measures the sensitivity of the Companys portfolio to potential changes in market prices using Value at Risk, or VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. NRGs risk management policy places a limit on one day holding period VaR, which limits the Companys net open position. As the Companys trade by trade derivative accounting results in a gross up of the Companys derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of NRGs hedging activity. As of December 31, 2010, NRGs net derivative asset was $672 million, an increase to total fair value of $213 million as compared to December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in fair value due to the decreases in gas and power prices partially offset by the roll off of trades that settled during the period and the addition of out of the money derivatives as part of the Green Mountain Energy acquisition. Based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $1 per MMBtu increase or decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would cause a change of approximately $183 million in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2010. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates NRGs discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with U.S. GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed. 89 Table of Contents On an ongoing basis, NRG evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Companys estimates. Any effects on the Companys business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. NRGs significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Companys financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting Policy Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application Derivative Instruments Assumptions used in valuation techniques Assumptions used in forecasting generation Market maturity and economic conditions Contract interpretation Market conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commitments Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets Ability to withstand legal challenges of tax authority decisions or appeals Anticipated future decisions of tax authorities Application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions Ability to utilize tax benefits through carry backs to prior periods and carry forwards to future periods Impairment of Long Lived Assets Recoverability of investment through future operations Regulatory and political environments and requirements Estimated useful lives of assets Environmental obligations and operational limitations Estimates of future cash flows Estimates of fair value Judgment about triggering events Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Estimated useful lives for finite lived intangible assets Judgment about impairment triggering events Estimates of reporting units fair value Fair value estimate of intangible assets acquired in business combinations Contingencies Estimated financial impact of event(s) Judgment about likelihood of event(s) occurring Regulatory and political environments and requirements Derivative Instruments The Company follows the guidance of ASC 815 to account for derivative instruments. ASC 815 requires the Company to mark to market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet, and recognize changes in the fair value of non hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. In certain cases, NRG may apply hedge accounting to the Companys derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives instruments accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item, or deferred and recorded as a component of OCI, and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur. 90 Table of Contents For purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, NRG uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes. When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models to determine the fair value. These internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. In order to qualify derivative instruments for hedged transactions, NRG estimates the forecasted generation occurring within a specified time period. Judgments related to the probability of forecasted generation occurring are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation, and historical physical delivery on similar contracts. The probability that hedged forecasted generation will occur by the end of a specified time period could change the results of operations by requiring amounts currently classified in OCI to be reclassified into earnings, creating increased variability in the Companys earnings. These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates. Certain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered NPNS. The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that NRG has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment, and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings. Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets As of December 31, 2010, NRG had a valuation allowance of $191 million. This amount is comprised of U.S. domestic capital loss carryforwards, certain state NOLs and non depreciable property of $116 million, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $74 million and foreign capital loss carryforwards of approximately $1 million. In assessing the recoverability of NRGs deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon projected capital gains and available tax planning strategies. NRG continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions. Considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. NRG is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including major operations located in Germany and Australia. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2002. With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2003. The Companys significant foreign operations are also no longer subject to examination by local jurisdictions for years prior to 2004. Evaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other Than Temporary Decline in Value In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, or ASC 360, NRG evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are: Significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset; Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition; Adverse business climate; Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset; Current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and Change in the Companys intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. 91 Table of Contents Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Companys estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material. For assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value under ASC 360, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held for sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. NRG considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence of such information, the Company may consider prices of similar assets, consult with brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. NRG will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability weights a range of possible outcomes. The use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in the Companys estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material. NRG is also required to evaluate its equity method and cost method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired. ASC 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures, or ASC 323, provides the accounting requirements for these investments. The standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under ASC 323 is whether the value is considered an "other than a temporary" decline in value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under ASC 323 involves the same uncertainties as described for long lived assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with ASC 360. Similarly, the estimates that NRG makes with respect to its equity and cost method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which the Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of ASC 360, NRG would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other than temporary decline in value under ASC 323. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets At December 31, 2010, NRG reported goodwill of $1.9 billion, consisting of $1.7 billion in its Texas operating segment, or NRG Texas, that is associated with the acquisition of Texas Genco in 2006, and $0.2 billion in its corporate operating segment that is associated with the acquisition of Green Mountain Energy in November 2010. The Company has also recorded intangible assets in connection with its business acquisitions, measured primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. See Item 15 Note 3, Business Acquisitions, and Note 11 Goodwill and Other Intangibles, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805, and ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, or ASC 350, to account for its goodwill and intangible assets. Under these standards, the Company amortizes all finite lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. However, goodwill and all intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairments at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the Companys operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, where necessary, the Companys goodwill and or intangible asset with indefinite lives will be impaired at that time. 92 Table of Contents The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2010, for its Texas reporting unit, NRG Texas, which is at the operating segment level. The Company determined the fair value of this reporting unit using primarily an income approach and then applied an overall market approach reasonableness test to reconcile that fair value with NRGs overall market capitalization. Significant inputs to the determination of fair value were as follows: For the three solid fuel baseload plants that drive a majority of the value in the reporting unit, and for the regions Elbow Creek, Langford, Cedar Bayou and South Trent facilities that recently commenced operations, the Company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to their long term budgets. This approach is consistent with that used to determine fair value in prior years. These budgets are based on the Companys views of power and fuel prices, which consider market prices in the near term and the Companys fundamental view for the longer term as some relevant market prices are illiquid beyond 24 months. Hedging is included to the extent of contracts already in place. Projected generation in the long term budgets is based on managements estimate of supply and demand within the sub markets for each plant and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant; For the reporting units remaining gas plants, the Company applied a market derived earnings multiple to the gas plants aggregate estimated 2010 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. This approach is consistent with that used to determine fair values in prior years; The intangible value to NRG Texas for synergies it provides to Reliant Energy was determined by capitalizing estimated annual collateral charge and supply cost savings; and The potential impact of carbon legislation was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology applied to the Companys view of the impact of potential legislation that is based on recent proposals to Congress. If fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. Under the income approach described above, the Company estimated the fair value of NRG Texas invested capital to exceed its carrying value by approximately 23% at December 31, 2010. The Company also evaluated various market derived data including market research forecasts, recent merger and acquisition activity and earnings multiples, and together with its estimate of fair value, concluded that NRG Texass goodwill is not impaired at December 31, 2010. To reconcile the fair value determined under the income approach with NRGs market capitalization, the Company considered historical and future budgeted earnings measures to estimate the average percentage of total company value represented by NRG Texas, and applied this percentage to an adjusted business enterprise value of NRG. To derive this adjusted business enterprise value, the Company applied a range of control premiums based on recent market transactions to the business enterprise value of NRG on a non controlling, marketable basis, and also made adjustments for some non operating assets and for some of the significant factors that impact NRG differently from NRG Texas, such as environmental capital expenditures outside of the Texas region, and the impact of nuclear development efforts on NRGs stock price. The Company also qualitatively considered the impact on its stock price of shorter term market views about forward natural gas prices. The Company was able to reconcile the proportional value of NRG Texas to NRGs market capitalization at a value that would not indicate an impairment. The Companys estimate of fair value under the income approach described above is affected by assumptions about projected power prices, generation, fuel costs, capital expenditure requirements and environmental regulations, and the Company believes that the most significant impact arises from future power prices. The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates power plants. Assuming all other factors are held constant, a hypothetical $1 drop in the Companys long term natural gas price view would cause the fair value of NRG Texas to fall 4% below its carrying value at December 31, 2010. If long term natural gas prices remain depressed for an extended period of time, the Companys goodwill may become impaired in the future, which would result in a non cash charge, not to exceed $1.7 billion. 93 Table of Contents Contingencies NRG records a loss contingency when management determines it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Developments See Item 15 Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments. 94  Table of Contents  Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NRG is exposed to several market risks in the Companys normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with the Companys merchant power generation or with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transaction. The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and currency exchange risk. In order to manage these risks the Company uses various fixed price forward purchase and sales contracts, futures and option contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and swaps and options traded in the over the counter financial markets to: Manage and hedge fixed price purchase and sales commitments; Manage and hedge exposure to variable rate debt obligations; Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices, and Hedge fuel requirements for the Companys generating facilities. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices, volatilities, and correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal, oil, and emissions credits. NRG manages the commodity price risk of the Companys merchant generation operations and load serving obligations by entering into various derivative or non derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales and purchases of electricity and fuel. NRG measures the risk of the Companys portfolio using several analytical methods, including sensitivity tests, scenario tests, stress tests, position reports, and Value at Risk, or VaR. NRG uses a diversified VaR model to calculate an estimate of the potential loss in the fair value of the Companys energy assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, load obligations, and bilateral physical and financial transactions. NRGs portfolio consists of generation assets and full requirement load serving obligations. NRG manages the commodity price risk of the Companys merchant generation operations and load serving obligations by entering into various derivative or non derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of electricity and purchases and fuel. These instruments include forwards, futures, swaps, and option contracts traded on various exchanges, such as New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, and Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, as well as over the counter markets. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon managements assessment of market, weather, operation and other factors. While some of the contracts the Company uses to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources, other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices, contract quantities, or both. NRG uses the Companys best estimates to determine the fair value of those derivative contracts. However, it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording mark to market derivative instrument valuation, and such variations could be material. NRG measures the risk of the Companys portfolio using several analytical methods, including sensitivity tests, scenario tests, stress tests, position reports, and VaR. VaR is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. Currently, the company estimates VaR using a Monte Carlo simulation based methodology. 95 Table of Contents NRG uses a diversified VaR model to calculate an estimate of the potential loss in the fair value of the Companys energy assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, load obligations, and bilateral physical and financial transactions. The key assumptions for the Companys diversified model include: (i) a lognormal distribution of prices; (ii) one day holding period; (iii) a 95% confidence interval; (iv) a rolling 36 month forward looking period; and (v) market implied volatilities and historical price correlations. As of December 31, 2010, the VaR for NRGs commodity portfolio, including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions calculated using the diversified VaR model was $50 million. The following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VaR for NRG for the years ended December 31, 2010, and 2009: VaR In millions As of December 31, 2010 $ 50 Average 54 Maximum 70 Minimum 37 As of December 31, 2009 $ 38 Average 41 Maximum 55 Minimum 28 Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as VaR, the evolving nature of the competitive markets for electricity and related derivatives, and the seasonality of changes in market prices, the VaR calculation may not capture the full extent of commodity price exposure. As a result, actual changes in the fair value of mark to market energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated VaR, and such changes could have a material impact on the Companys financial results. In order to provide additional information for comparative purposes to NRGs peers, the Company also uses VaR to estimate the potential loss of derivative financial instruments that are subject to mark to market accounting. These derivative instruments include transactions that were entered into for both asset management and trading purposes. The VaR for the derivative financial instruments calculated using the diversified VaR model as of December 31, 2010, for the entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset management and trading, was $15 million primarily driven by asset backed transactions. Interest Rate Risk NRG is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through the Companys issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument. NRGs risk management policies allow the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations. In May 2009, NRG entered into a series of forward starting interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps become effective on April 1, 2011, and are intended to hedge the risks associated with floating interest rates. For each of the interest rate swaps, the Company will pay its counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest payment on a predetermined notional value, and NRG receives the monthly equivalent of a floating interest payment based on a 1 month LIBOR calculated on the same notional value. All interest rate swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made monthly and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period. The total notional amount of these swaps, which mature on February 1, 2013, is $900 million. 96 Table of Contents In 2006, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps which are intended to hedge the risk associated with floating interest rates. For each of the interest rate swaps, NRG pays its counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest payment on a predetermined notional value, and NRG receives the equivalent of a floating interest payment based on a 3 month LIBOR rate calculated on the same notional value. All interest rate swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made quarterly, and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period. While the notional value of each of the swaps does not vary over time, the swaps are designed to mature sequentially. The total notional amount of these swaps as of December 31, 2010, was $1.55 billion. The maturities and notional amounts of each tranche of these swaps in connection with the Senior Credit Facility are as follows: Maturity Notional Value March 31, 2011 $ 1.55 billion February 1, 2013 (effective March 1, 2011) $ 0.90 billion In addition to those discussed above, the Company had the following additional interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2010: Notional Value Maturity Floating to fixed interest rate swap for NRG Peaker Financing LLC $ 231 million June 2019 Floating to fixed interest rate swap for South Trent $ 58 million June 2020 Forward Starting, Floating to fixed interest rate swap for South Trent $ 21 million June 2028 Floating to fixed interest rate swap for NRG Solar Blythe $ 21 million June 2028 If all of the above swaps had been discontinued on December 31, 2010, the Company would have owed the counterparties $91 million. Based on the investment grade rating of the counterparties, NRG believes its exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by counterparties to its hedge contracts to be insignificant. NRG has both long and short term debt instruments that subject the Company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2010, a 1% change in interest rates would result in a $7 million change in interest expense on a rolling twelve month basis. As of December 31, 2010, the Companys debt fair value, including funded letter of credit, was $10.5 billion and the carrying amount was $10.4 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Companys long term debt by $599 million. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of NRGs activities and in the management of the Companys assets and liabilities. The Company is currently exposed to additional collateral posting if natural gas prices decline primarily due to the long natural gas equivalent position at various exchanges used to hedge NRGs retail supply load obligations. Based on a sensitivity analysis for power and gas positions under marginable contracts, a $1 per MMBtu change in natural gas prices across the term of the marginable contracts would cause a change in margin collateral posted of approximately $99 million as of December 31, 2010, and a 0.25 MMBtu/MWh change in heat rates for heat rate positions would result in a change in margin collateral posted of approximately $19 million as of December 31, 2010. This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated based on portfolio composition and margin related contract provisions as of December 31, 2010. Under the second lien, NRG is required to post certain letters of credit as credit support for changes in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2010, no letters of credit are outstanding to second lien counterparties. With changes in commodity prices, the letters of credit could grow to $64 million, the cap under the agreements. 97  Table of Contents Counterparty Credit Risk Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non performance or non payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; (ii) a daily monitoring of counterparties credit limits; (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, credit derivatives, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk with a diversified portfolio of counterparties. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at NRG to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle. As of December 31, 2010, total credit exposure to a significant portion of the Companys counterparties was $1.4 billion and NRG held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of $414 million resulting in a net exposure of $976 million. Total credit exposure is discounted at the risk free rate. The following table highlights the credit quality and the net counterparty credit exposure by industry sector. Net counterparty credit risk is defined as the aggregate net asset position for NRG with counterparties where netting is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark to market and Normal Purchase Normal Sale, or NPNS, and non derivative transactions. The exposure is shown net of collateral held, and includes amounts net of receivables or payables. Category Net Exposure (a) (% of Total) Financial institutions 53 % Utilities, energy merchants, marketers and other 36 Coal and emissions 7 ISOs 4 Total as of December 31, 2010 100 % Category Net Exposure (a) (% of Total) Investment grade 74 % Non rated (b) 19 Non Investment grade 7 Total as of December 31, 2010 100 % (a)Counterparty credit exposure excludes uranium and coal transportation contracts because of the unavailability of market prices. (b)For non rated counterparties, the majority are related to ISO and municipal public power entities, which are considered investment grade equivalent ratings based on NRGs internal credit ratings. NRG has credit risk exposure to certain wholesale counterparties representing more than 10% of the total net exposure discussed above and the aggregate of such counterparties was $251 million. Approximately 80% of NRGs positions relating to this credit risk roll off by the end of 2012. Changes in hedge positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty concentration. Given the credit quality, diversification and term of the exposure in the portfolio, NRG does not anticipate a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations from nonperformance by any of NRGs counterparties. Counterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long term contracts, including California tolling agreements, South Central load obligations and a coal supply agreement. As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company valued these contracts based on various techniques including but not limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. Based on these valuation techniques, as of December 31, 2010, credit risk exposure to these counterparties is approximately $520 million for the next five years. Many of these power contracts are with utilities or public power entities that have strong credit quality and specific public utility commission or other regulatory support. In the case of the coal supply agreement, NRG holds a lien against the underlying asset. These factors significantly reduce the risk of loss. 98 Table of Contents Retail Customer Credit Risk NRG is exposed to retail credit risk through its retail electricity providers, which serve C&I customers and the Mass market. Retail credit risk results when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses could be incurred from nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and any in the money forward value. NRG manages retail credit risk through the use of established credit policies that include monitoring of the portfolio, and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, the Companys credit exposure to C&I customers was diversified across many customers and various industries, with a significant portion of the exposure with government entities. NRG is also exposed to credit risk relating to its Mass customers, which may result in a write off of bad debt. During 2010, the Company continued to experience improved customer payment behavior, but current economic conditions may affect the Companys customers ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in bad debt expense. Credit Risk Related Contingent Features Certain of the Companys hedging agreements contain provisions that require the Company to post additional collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been deterioration in credit quality, generally termed "adequate assurance" under the agreements, or require the Company to post additional collateral if there were a one notch downgrade in the Companys credit rating. The collateral required for contracts that have adequate assurance clauses that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2010, was $34 million. The collateral required for contracts with credit rating contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2010, was $11 million. The Company is also a party to certain marginable agreements where NRG has a net liability position but the counterparty has not called for the collateral due, which is approximately $20 million as of December 31, 2010. Currency Exchange Risk NRGs foreign earnings and investments may be subject to foreign currency exchange risk, which NRG generally does not hedge. As these earnings and investments are not material to NRGs consolidated results, the Companys foreign currency exposure is limited.
