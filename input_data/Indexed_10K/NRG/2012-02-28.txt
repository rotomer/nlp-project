Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe discussion and analysis below has been organized as follows:Executive Summary, including business strategy, the business environment in which NRG operates, how regulation, weather, competition and other factors affect the business, and significant events that are important to understanding the results of operations and financial condition for the 2011 period;Results of operations, including an explanation of significant differences between the periods in the specific line items of NRGs Consolidated Statements of Operations;Financial condition addressing credit ratings, liquidity position, sources and uses of cash, capital resources and requirements, commitments, and off balance sheet arrangements; andCritical accounting policies which are most important to both the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgment.As you read this discussion and analysis, refer to NRGs Consolidated Statements of Operations to this Form 10 K, which presents the results of the Companys operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, and also refer to Item I to this Form 10 K for more detailed discussion about the Companys business.58Table of ContentsExecutive SummaryBusiness StrategyNRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is an integrated wholesale power generation and retail electricity company that aspires to be a leader in the way the industry and consumers think about, use, produce and deliver energy and energy services in major competitive power markets in the United States. First, NRG is a wholesale power generator engaged in the ownership and operation of power generation facilities; the trading of energy, capacity and related products; and the transacting in and trading of fuel and transportation services. Second, NRG is a retail electricity company engaged in the supply of electricity, energy services, and cleaner energy products to retail electricity customers in deregulated markets through the Retail Businesses. Finally, NRG is focused on the deployment and commercialization of potential disruptive technologies, like electric vehicles, Distributed Solar and smart meter technology, which have the potential to change the nature of the power supply industry. The Companys core business is focused on: (i) excellence in safety and operating performance of its existing assets; (ii) serving the energy needs of end use residential, commercial and industrial customers in the Companys core markets with a retail energy product that is differentiated either by premium service (Reliant), sustainability (Green Mountain Energy) or loyalty/affinity programs (Energy Plus); (iii) optimal hedging of baseload generation and retail load operations, while retaining optionality on the Companys peaking facilities; (iv) repowering of power generation assets at premium sites; (v) investment in, and deployment of, alternative energy technologies both in its wholesale and, particularly, in and around its retail businesses and their customers; (vi) pursuing selective acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures and investments; and (vii) engaging in a proactive capital allocation plan focused on achieving the regular return of and on stockholder capital within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.The Company believes that the American energy industry is going to be increasingly impacted by the long term societal trend towards sustainability which is both generational and irreversible. Moreover, the information technology driven revolution which has enabled greater and easier personal choice in other sectors on the consumer economy will do the same in the American energy sector over the years to come. As a result, energy consumers will have increasing personal control over whom they buy their energy from, how that energy is generated and used and what environmental impact these individual choices will have. The Companys initiatives in this area of future growth are focused on: (i) renewables, with a concentration in solar development; (ii) electric vehicle ecosystems; (iii) customer facing energy products and services including smart grid services, nationwide retail green electricity, unique retail sales channels involving loyalty and affinity programs and custom design; and (iv) construction of other forms of on site clean power generation. The Companys advances in each of these areas are driven by select acquisitions, joint ventures, and investments that are more fully described in Item 1, Business New and On going Company Initiatives and Development Projects.Business EnvironmentThe industry dynamics and external influences affecting the Company and the power generation industry in 2011 and for the future medium term include:Consolidation There were several mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. power sector in 2011. Over the long term, industry consolidation is expected to continue.Environmental Regulatory Landscape In 2011, a number of U.S. EPA air regulations were finalized providing more clarity on the impact to electric generating units. A number of regulations with the potential for impact are still in development or under review by the U.S. EPA: NSPS for GHGs, NAAQS revisions, coal combustion byproducts, and once through cooling. While most of these regulations have been considered for some time, the outcomes and any resulting impact on NRG cannot be fully predicted until the rules are finalized. The timing and stringency of these regulations will contribute to a framework for the retrofit of existing fossil plants and deployment of new, cleaner technologies in the next decade. See Item 1, Business Environmental Matters, for further discussion.Public Policy Support and Government Financial Incentives for Clean Infrastructure Development Policy mechanisms including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, RPS, and carbon trading plans have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable generation, demand side and smart grid, and other clean infrastructure technologies. The availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics of the Companys development program and expansion into clean energy investments.59Table of ContentsNatural Gas Market The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates power plants. Natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas consumers and producers. In 2011, average natural gas prices were 8% lower than 2010 and comparable to prices seen in 2009. Supply continues to reflect increased production from low extraction cost resources such as the shale basins. In 2012, a mild winter and increased production have led to spot prices dipping into the $2.50/MMBtu range. At these current depressed levels, significant coal to gas switching is expected, making wholesale changes to Merit Order in many electric markets. While some gas producers have publicly spoken of scaling back production, it is too early to assess whether there is action behind their words. At current rates of production, storage levels may challenge storage limits later in the year. While the near term gas price outlook is depressed, a return to normal weather, coal fired plant retirements due to proposed environmental regulations and Liquid Natural Gas export possibilities may drive higher gas prices in the medium term. If long term gas prices remain depressed, the Company is likely to encounter further reductions in realized energy prices, leading to lower energy revenues as higher priced hedge contracts mature and are replaced by contracts with lower gas and power prices. The Retail Businesses gross margins have historically improved as natural gas prices decline and are likely to partially offset the impact of declining gas prices on conventional wholesale power generation. To further mitigate this impact, NRG may increase its percentage of baseload capacity sold forward using a variety of hedging instruments, as described under the heading Energy Related Commodities in Item 15 Note 6, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Companys increased investment in renewable power generation supported by PPAs also mitigates declines in long term gas prices.Electricity Price The price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the Companys generation portfolio. Many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity. In 2011, electricity prices in Texas were higher than 2010 due primarily to the extreme weather and record setting load experienced in August 2011. In NRGs other regions, prices were lower than in 2010, mainly due to lower gas prices and negligible demand growth. The following table summarizes average on peak power prices for each of the major markets in which NRG operates for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009: Average on Peak Power Price ($/MWh)Region2011 2010 2009Texas$57.42 $40.40 $35.43Northeast53.09 56.69 46.14South Central36.30 40.25 33.58West36.39 40.05 39.70WeatherWeather conditions in the regions of the United States in which NRG does business influence the Companys financial results. Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Companys results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas are higher in the winter. However, all regions of the United States typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG is typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once.60Table of ContentsOther FactorsA number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for NRGs business. These factors include:seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;extreme peak demands;available supply resources;transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions;location of NRGs generating facilities relative to the location of its load serving opportunities;procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; andchanges in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations.These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in:weather conditions;market liquidity;capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems;local transportation systems; andthe nature and extent of electricity deregulation.Environmental Matters, Regulatory Matters and Legal ProceedingsNRG discusses details of its other environmental matters in Item 15 Note 24, Environmental Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1, Business Environmental Matters, section. NRG discusses details of its regulatory matters in Item 15 Note 23, Regulatory Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1, Business Regulatory Matters, section. NRG discusses details of its legal proceedings in Item 15 Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of this information relates to costs that may be material to the Companys financial results.Impact of inflation on NRGs resultsUnless discussed specifically in the relevant segment, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the impact of inflation and changing prices (due to changes in exchange rates) on NRGs revenues and net income was immaterial.Significant events during the year ended December 31, 2011Results of Operations and Financial ConditionLower net income Net income decreased by 59% from $477 million to $197 million, which reflects a decrease in gross margin for wholesale generation driven by lower realized prices and a decrease in gross margin from the unprecedented heat wave in August 2011 in Texas, which negatively impacted both retail and generation gross margins. In addition, the decrease reflects a $160 million impairment charge on emissions allowances, the $495 million impairment of NRGs investment in Nuclear Innovation North America LLC, or NINA, and a loss on debt extinguishment of $175 million. These amounts were offset in part by a tax benefit of $843 million in 2011, which primarily reflects the impact of the resolution of the federal tax audit in June 2011, compared to tax expense of $277 million in 2010.Liquidity position The Companys total liquidity, excluding collateral received, decreased by $2.2 billion in 2011. Cash balances decreased by $1.8 billion since the end of 2010, primarily due to capital expenditures for solar and other repowering projects, as well as additional share repurchases. In addition, availability under the revolving credit arrangements decreased due to additional letters of credit required for solar and other repowering projects. Long term debt During 2011, the Company increased its non recourse debt by approximately $1.0 billion primarily in connection with the financing of the construction of three Utility Scale Solar facilities. 61Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations2011 compared to 2010The following table provides selected financial information for the Company: Year Ended December 31, (In millions except otherwise noted)2011 2010 Change %Operating Revenues Energy revenue (a)$2,069 $2,854 (28)%Capacity revenue (a)736 824 (11)Retail revenue5,807 5,277 10Mark to market for economic hedging activities325 (199) 263Contract amortization(159) (195) 18Thermal revenue143 145 (1)Other revenues (b)158 143 10Total operating revenues9,079 8,849 3Operating Costs and Expenses Generation cost of sales (a)2,425 2,102 15Retail cost of sales (a)2,815 2,822 Mark to market for economic hedging activities169 (111) 252Contract and emissions credit amortization47 15 213Thermal cost of sales63 68 (7)Other cost of operations1,156 1,177 (2)Total cost of operations6,675 6,073 10Depreciation and amortization896 838 7Impairment charge on emission allowances160 N/ASelling, general and administrative668 598 12Development costs45 55 (18)Total operating costs and expenses8,444 7,564 12Gain on sale of assets 23 (100)Operating Income635 1,308 (51)Other Income/(Expense) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates35 44 (20)Impairment charge on investment(495) N/AOther income, net19 33 (42)Loss on debt extinguishment(175) (2) N/AInterest expense(665) (630) 6Total other expense(1,281) (555) 131(Loss)/Income before income tax expense(646) 753 (186)Income tax (benefit)/ expense(843) 277 (404)Net Income197 476 (59)Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (1) 100Net income attributable to NRG Energy, Inc. $197 $477 (59)Business Metrics Average natural gas price Henry Hub ($/MMBtu)4.04 4.39 (8)%(a)Includes realized gains and losses from financially settled transactions.(b)Includes unrealized trading gains and losses.

The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same caption as the items being hedged.For the year ended December 31, 2011, the $403 million gain in operating revenue from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by an increase in value of forward purchases and sales of natural gas and electricity due to a decrease in forward power and gas prices. The $408 million loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by a decrease in value of forward purchases of natural gas, electricity and fuel due to a decrease in forward power and gas prices. Reliant Energys $72 million gain from the roll off of acquired derivatives consists of loss positions that were acquired as of May 1, 2009, and valued using forward prices on that date. These roll off amounts were offset by realized losses at the settled prices and higher costs of physical power which are reflected in operating costs and expenses during the same period. Green Mountain Energys $35 million gain from the roll off of acquired derivatives consists of loss positions that were acquired as of November 5, 2010, and valued using forward prices on that date. These roll off amounts were offset by realized losses at the settled prices and higher costs of physical power which are reflected in operating costs and expenses during the same period.68Table of ContentsIn accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Companys financial and physical trading of energy commodities for the years ended December 31, 2011, and 2010.

These were offset in part by the current year write off of $12 million of Bluewater Wind assets.Corporate operations and maintenance increased as a result of the acquisition of Green Mountain Energy in November 2010, resulting in a full year of expense compared to two months in the prior year, as well as the acquisition of Energy Plus on September 30, 2011.South Central operations and maintenance increased by $18 million due to increased operations and maintenance related to the addition of the Cottonwood Facility, offset in part by $12 million related to the scope and timing of outage work at Big Cajun II in 2010.Depreciation and AmortizationNRGs depreciation and amortization expense increased by $58 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010. This was primarily due to additional depreciation related to a full year of depreciation for Cottonwood, Green Mountain Energy, and Northwind Phoenix which were acquired in 2010, as compared to a partial year of depreciation in 2010.Impairment Charge on Emission Allowances As described in Item 15 Note 24, Environmental Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $160 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, on the Companys Acid Rain Program SO2 emission allowances, which were recorded as an intangible asset on the Companys balance sheet. The impairment charge reflects the write off of the value of emission allowances in excess of those required for compliance with the Acid Rain Program.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $70 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, which was primarily due to:The acquisition of Green Mountain Energy in November 2010, and the acquisition of Energy Plus in September 2011, which resulted in additional expense in 2011 of $74 million and $16 million, respectively. Increased marketing costs of $8 million associated with additional advertising campaigns and sponsorship arrangements. These increases were offset by: A decrease in bad debt expense of $13 million at Reliant Energy due to improved customer payment behavior and decreased revenues.A decrease in employee benefits costs of $24 million.A reduction in charitable contributions, due to $8 million of funding for the Reliant Energy Charitable Foundation which was created and funded in 2010.Development CostsDevelopment costs decreased $10 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, as many of the NRG Solar projects are in construction phase in 2011.Gain on Sale of AssetsOn January 11, 2010, NRG sold Padoma to Enel, recognizing a gain on the sale of $23 million.70Table of ContentsEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated AffiliatesNRGs equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $9 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010. The decrease is due primarily to the changes in fair value of Sherbinos forward gas contract of $10 million and a decrease in equity earnings from Gladstone of $15 million, offset by an increase in equity earnings of $10 million from GenConn, as the Devon and Middletown peaking facilities commenced commercial operations in June 2010 and June 2011, respectively, and an increase of $2 million from Saguaro.Impairment Charge on InvestmentAs discussed in more detail in Item 15 Note 4, Nuclear Innovation North America LLC Developments, Including Impairment Charge, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the devastating March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which in turn, triggered a nuclear incident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, caused NRG to evaluate its investment in NINA for impairment. Consequently, NRG deconsolidated its investment in NINA and recorded an impairment charge in the first quarter equal to the balance of its investment in NINA. In concurrence with a substantial reduction in NINAs project workforce, and to support NINAs reduced scope of work, NRG contributed an additional $14 million into NINA in the year ended December 31, 2011. As a result, NRG recorded an impairment charge of $495 million in the year ended December 31, 2011.Other Income/(Expense), NetNRGs other income, net decreased $14 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, which relates primarily to foreign exchange gains of $14 million recognized in the prior period. Loss on Debt ExtinguishmentA loss on debt extinguishment of $175 million was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011, which primarily consisted of the premiums paid on redemption and the write off of previously deferred financing costs related to the redemptions of the 2014 Senior Notes and the 2016 Senior Notes, and the write off of previously deferred financing costs related to the replacement of NRGs Senior Credit Facility with the 2011 Senior Credit Facility. Interest ExpenseNRGs interest expense increased by $35 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010 due to the following: (In millions)Increase/(decrease) in interest expense Increase for 2020 Senior Notes issued in August 2010$58Increase for 2018 Senior Notes issued in January 201185Increase for 2019 and 2021 Senior Notes issued in May 201194Decrease for 2014 Senior Notes redeemed in January and February 2011(65)Decrease for 2016 Senior Notes redeemed in May and June 2011(102)Increase for project financings15Increase for tax exempt bonds12Decrease for refinancing of term loan and revolving credit facility(18)Decrease for capitalized interest(44)Total$3571Table of ContentsIncome Tax ExpenseThere was an income tax benefit of $843 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to income tax expense of $277 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

The benefit is predominantly due to the recognition of previously uncertain tax benefits that were settled upon audit in 2011 and that were mainly composed of net operating losses of $536 million which had been classified as capital loss carryforwards for financial statement purposes. The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740. These factors and others, including the Companys history of pre tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets.72Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations2010 compared to 2009The following table provides selected financial information for the Company: Year Ended December 31, (In millions except otherwise noted)2010 2009 Change %Operating Revenues Energy revenue (a)$2,854 $3,726 (23)%Capacity revenue (a)824 1,023 (19)Retail revenue5,277 4,440 19Mark to market for economic hedging activities(199) (107) (86)Contract amortization(195) (179) (9)Thermal revenue145 137 6Other revenues (b)143 (88) 263Total operating revenues8,849 8,952 (1)Operating Costs and Expenses Generation cost of sales (a)2,102 1,844 14Retail cost of sales (a)2,822 3,121 (10)Mark to market activities(111) (842) (87)Contract and emissions credit amortization (c)15 (4) 475Thermal cost of sales68 67 1Other cost of operations1,177 1,137 4Total cost of operations6,073 5,323 14Depreciation and amortization838 818 2Selling, general and administrative598 550 9Acquisition related transaction and integration costs 54 (100)Development costs55 48 15Total operating costs and expenses7,564 6,793 11Gain on sale of assets23 N/AOperating income1,308 2,159 (39)Other Income/(Expense) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates44 41 7Gain on sale of equity method investments 128 (100)Other income/(expense), net33 (5) N/ALoss on debt extinguishment and refinancing expenses(2) (20) (90)Interest expense(630) (634) (1)Total other expense(555) (490) 13Income before income tax expense753 1,669 (55)Income tax expense277 728 (62)Net Income476 941 (49)Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest(1) (1) Net income attributable to NRG Energy, Inc. $477 $942 (49)Business Metrics Average natural gas price Henry Hub ($/MMBtu)4.39 3.92 12 %(a) Includes realized gains and losses from financially settled transactions.(b)Includes unrealized trading gains and losses.

The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same caption as the items being hedged.For the year ended December 31, 2010, the $33 million loss in operating revenue from economic hedge positions is primarily driven by a decrease in value of forward purchases and sales of natural gas and electricity due to a decrease in forward power and gas prices. The $120 million loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions is primarily driven by a decrease in value of forward purchases of natural gas, electricity and fuel due to a decrease in forward power and gas prices. Reliant Energys $223 million gain from the roll off of acquired derivatives consists of loss positions that were acquired as of May 1, 2009, and valued using forward prices on that date. These roll off amounts were offset by realized losses at the settled prices and higher costs of physical power which are reflected in operating costs and expenses during the same period. Green Mountain Energys $13 million gain from the roll off of acquired derivatives consists of loss positions that were acquired as of November 5, 2010, and valued using forward prices on that date. These roll off amounts were offset by realized losses at the settled prices and higher costs of physical power which are reflected in operating costs and expenses during the same period.In accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Companys financial and physical trading of energy commodities for the years ended December 31, 2010, and 2009.

South Central operations and maintenance expense increased by $12 million as the scope and duration of planned maintenance work at the regions coal facility was greater in 2010 than in the same period in 2009.Thermal operations and maintenance expense increase by $6 million relating to the acquisition of Northwind Phoenix in 2010.Reliant Energy operations and maintenance expense decreased by $11 million due to lower spending for external costs associated with customer activities including the call center, billing, remittance processing, and credit and collections as well as information technology costs associated with those activities.Depreciation and AmortizationNRGs depreciation and amortization expense increased by $20 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. An increase of $26 million was due to depreciation on the baghouse projects in Western New York and additional depreciation at the Cedar Bayou plant, the Langford wind facilities and the Blythe solar facility. Cedar Bayou began commercial operation in June 2009 and the Langford wind facilities began commercial operation in December 2009. An additional increase of $9 million was due to amortization expense at Green Mountain Energy after the date of acquisition.This increase was offset by a $20 million decrease in depreciation and amortization for Reliant Energy compared to the same period in 2009. Reliant Energys depreciation and amortization expense decreased $59 million during the eight months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, which relates primarily to the amortization expense related to Mass customer relationships valued under purchase accounting which is recognized as the underlying contracts roll off. This decrease at Reliant Energy was offset by $39 million of additional depreciation and amortization expense for the first four months of 2010.81Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $48 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. Excluding $68 million of additional expense for Reliant Energy in the first four months of 2010, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $20 million, due to:A decrease in bad debt expense of $20 million due to decreased revenues and improved customer payment behavior.Prior year non recurring costs related to Exelons exchange offer and proxy contest efforts of $31 million.These decreases were offset by:Green Mountain Energys costs of $10 million incurred since the acquisition date.The contribution of $8 million in funding for the Reliant Energy Charitable Foundation which was created in 2010.An increase in $8 million in professional services for various on going projects in 2010.Reliant Energy Acquisition Related Transaction and Integration CostsNRG incurred Reliant Energy acquisition related transaction and integration costs of $54 million for 2009. These integration efforts were completed by the end of 2009.Development CostsDevelopment costs increased $7 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009 due to increased costs incurred primarily on NRG Solar development projects.Gain on Sale of AssetsOn January 11, 2010, NRG sold Padoma to Enel, recognizing a gain on sale of $23 million.Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated AffiliatesNRGs equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased by $3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. The 2010 results included increased equity earnings of $15 million from Sherbino, which related to the fair value of a hedge, and $7 million from Gladstone. In 2009, NRG recognized equity earnings of $15 million from MIBRAG, which was sold in June 2009.Gain on Sale of Equity Method Investments and Other Income/(Loss), NetNRGs gain on sale of equity method investments in 2009 represents a $128 million gain on the sale of NRGs 50% ownership interest in MIBRAG.Other Income/(Expense), NetNRGs other income, net increased $38 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009 principally due to foreign exchange transactions. The 2010 amount included $5 million and $9 million of unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains, respectively. The 2009 amount included a $24 million loss on a forward contract for foreign currency executed to hedge the sale proceeds from the MIBRAG sale in 2009.Refinancing ExpensesIn 2009, NRG incurred a $20 million expense associated with the CSRA unwind with Merrill Lynch. 82Table of ContentsInterest ExpenseNRGs interest expense decreased by $4 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009 due to the following: (In millions)(Decrease)/increase in interest expense Increase for 2020 Senior Notes issued in August 2010$33Increase for 2019 Senior Notes issued in June 200925Decrease due to settlement of the CSF Debt in 2009 and early 2010(26)Decrease in fees incurred on the CSRA facility(27)Decrease in capitalized interest2Decrease due to Term Loan balance reduction in 2010(9)Other(2)Total$(4)Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense decreased by $451 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 2009.

The valuation allowance is recorded primarily against capital loss carryforwards, this resulted in an decrease of $34 million in income tax expense in 2010.Tax Expense Reduction The Company recorded a lower federal and state tax expense of $325 million primarily due to lower pre tax earnings.Foreign Operations In 2010, the Company repatriated foreign dividends to the U.S. resulting in an increase in tax expense of $17 million.The effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740. These factors and others, including the Companys history of pre tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets.83Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidity PositionAs of December 31, 2011, and 2010, NRGs liquidity, excluding collateral received, was approximately $2.1 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, comprised of the following: As of December 31, 2011 2010 (In millions)Cash and cash equivalents$1,105 $2,951Funds deposited by counterparties258 408Restricted cash292 8Total1,655 3,3672011 Revolving Credit Facility availability673 Funded Letter of Credit Facility availability 440Revolving Credit Facility availability 853Total liquidity2,328 4,660Less: Funds deposited as collateral by hedge counterparties(258) (408)Total liquidity, excluding collateral received$2,070 $4,252For the year ended December 31, 2011, total liquidity, excluding collateral received, decreased by $2.2 billion due primarily to $1.8 billion lower cash and cash equivalent balances. Changes in cash and cash equivalent balances are further discussed hereinafter under the heading Cash Flow Discussion. Cash and cash equivalents and funds deposited by counterparties at December 31, 2011, were predominantly held in money market funds invested in treasury securities, treasury repurchase agreements or government agency debt.Included in restricted cash is $216 million of cash and cash equivalents held in controlled accounts as collateral to support the Companys equity funding obligations for the Ivanpah, Agua Caliente, and CVSR projects. As discussed more fully in Item 15 Note 3, Business Acquisitions and Disposition, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, this is a requirement of the U.S. DOE, which guarantees the Agua Caliente, Ivanpah, and CVSR debt. This collateral can be replaced, at the Companys discretion, with a letter of credit in order to utilize such amounts for other purposes. The Companys total liquidity excluding such amounts is $1.9 billion. The line item "Funds deposited by counterparties" represents the amounts that are held by NRG as a result of collateral posting obligations from the Companys counterparties due to positions in the Companys hedging program. These amounts are segregated into separate accounts that are not contractually restricted but, based on the Companys intention, are not available for the payment of NRGs general corporate obligations. Depending on market fluctuation and the settlement of the underlying contracts, the Company will refund this collateral to the counterparties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the underlying trades. Since collateral requirements fluctuate daily and the Company cannot predict if any collateral will be held for more than twelve months, the funds deposited by counterparties are classified as a current asset on the Companys balance sheet, with an offsetting liability for this cash collateral received within current liabilities. As discussed more fully in Item 15 Note 12, Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, to this Form 10 K, on July 1, 2011, NRG replaced its Senior Credit Facility, consisting of its Term Loan Facility, Revolving Credit Facility and Funded Letter of Credit Facility, with the 2011 Senior Credit Facility, which includes the 2011 Revolving Credit Facility.Management believes that the Companys liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance operating and maintenance capital expenditures, to fund dividends to NRGs preferred stockholders, and other liquidity commitments. Management continues to regularly monitor the Companys ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.84Table of ContentsCredit RatingsCredit rating agencies rate a firms public debt securities. These ratings are utilized by the debt markets in evaluating a firms credit risk. Ratings influence the price paid to issue new debt securities by indicating to the market the Companys ability to pay principal, interest and preferred dividends. Rating agencies evaluate a firms industry, cash flow, leverage, liquidity, and hedge profile, among other factors, in their credit analysis of a firms credit risk.The following table summarizes the credit ratings for NRG Energy, Inc., its 2011 Term Loan Facility and its Senior Notes as of December 31, 2011: S&P Moodys FitchNRG Energy, Inc.

As described in Item 15 Note 12, Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Companys financing arrangements consist mainly of the 2011 Senior Credit Facility, the Senior Notes, and project related financings.In addition, NRG has granted first liens to certain counterparties on substantially all of the Companys assets. NRG uses the first lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out of the money hedge agreements for forward sales of power or MWh equivalents. To the extent that the underlying hedge positions for a counterparty are in the money to NRG, the counterparty would have no claim under the lien program. The lien program limits the volume that can be hedged, not the value of underlying out of the money positions. The first lien program does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. Within the first lien structure, the Company can hedge up to 80% of its baseload capacity and 10% of its non baseload assets with these counterparties for the first 60 months and then declining thereafter. Net exposure to a counterparty on all trades must be positively correlated to the price of the relevant commodity for the first lien to be available to that counterparty. The first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.The Companys lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged prices. As of December 31, 2011, all hedges under the first liens were in the money on a counterparty aggregate basis.The following table summarizes the amount of MWs hedged against the Companys baseload assets and as a percentage relative to the Companys baseload capacity under the first lien structure as of December 31, 2011: Equivalent Net Sales Secured by First Lien Structure (a)2012 2013 2014 2015In MW (b)1,268 464 127 As a percentage of total net baseload capacity (c)19% 7% 2% % (a)Equivalent Net Sales include natural gas swaps converted using a weighted average heat rate by region.(b)2012 MW value consists of February through December positions only.(c)Net baseload capacity under the first lien structure represents 80% of the Companys total baseload assets.85Table of ContentsUses of LiquidityThe Companys requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) commercial operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations, as described more fully in Item 15 Note 12, Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (iii) capital expenditures, including repowering and renewable development, and environmental; and (iv) corporate financial transactions including return of capital to stockholders, as described in Item 15 Note 15, Capital Structure, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Commercial Operations NRGs commercial operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (i.e. buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions; and (v) collateral for project development. As of December 31, 2011, commercial operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $311 million, and $715 million outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its commercial activities for both wholesale and retail transactions (includes a $51 million letter of credit relating to deposits at the PUCT that cover outstanding customer deposits and residential advance payments). As of December 31, 2011, total collateral held from counterparties was $258 million in cash, and $12 million of letters of credit. Future liquidity requirements may change based on the Companys hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on NRGs credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.86Table of ContentsDebt Service ObligationsPrincipal payments on debt and capital leases as of December 31, 2011, are due in the following periods:Description2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In millions)NRG Recourse Debt: 7.875% Notes due 2021$ $ $ $ $ $1,200 $1,2008.25% Notes due 2020 1,100 1,1007.625% Notes due 2019 800 8008.5% Notes due 2019 700 7007.625% Notes due 2018 1,200 1,2007.375% Notes due 2017 1,090 1,090Term Loan Facility, due 201816 16 16 16 16 1,512 1,592Indian River Power LLC, tax exempt bonds, due 2040 and 2045 205 205Dunkirk Power LLC, tax exempt bonds, due 2042 59 59Subtotal NRG Recourse Debt16 161616167,866 7,946 NRG Non Recourse Debt: Ivanpah Financing: Solar Partners I, due 2014 and 2033 154 5 6 125 290Solar Partners II, due 2014 and 2038 128 5 6 175 314Solar Partners VIII, due 2014 and 2038 111 4 4 151 270NRG Peaker Finance Co.

In 2012, NRG will be continuing its efforts on the solar and El Segundo projects. Maintenance and Environmental capital expenditures For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Companys maintenance capital expenditures includes $51 million in nuclear fuel expenditures related to STP Units 1 and 2. The environmental capital expenditures includes $155 million related to a project to install selective catalytic reduction systems, scrubbers and fabric filters on Indian River Unit 4. The system was operational at year end 2011 and is undergoing performance testing.88Table of ContentsEnvironmental Capital Expenditures EstimateBased on current rules, technology and plans, NRG has estimated that environmental capital expenditures from 2012 through 2016 to meet NRGs environmental commitments will be approximately $553 million. These costs are primarily associated with mercury controls to satisfy MATS on the Companys Big Cajun II, W.A. Parish and Limestone facilities and a number of intake modification projects across the fleet under state or proposed federal 316(b) rules. NRG continues to explore cost effective compliance alternatives to reduce costs. While this estimate reflects anticipated schedules and controls related to the proposed 316(b) Rule, the full impact on the scope and timing of environmental retrofits from any new or revised regulations cannot be determined until these rules are final and any legal challenges are reviewed. However, NRG believes it is positioned to meet more stringent requirements through its planned capital expenditures, existing controls, and increasing generation from renewable resources.The table below summarizes installed and planned air quality controls for the NRG coal fleet. Planned investments are either in construction or budgeted in the existing capital expenditures budget. Changes to regulations could result in changes to planned installation dates. NRG uses an integrated approach to fuels, controls and emissions markets to meet environmental standards.

The actual recoveries will depend, among other things, on the timing of the completion of the capital projects and the remaining duration of the contracts.2011 Capital Allocation ProgramOn February 22, 2011, the Company announced its 2011 Capital Allocation Plan to purchase $180 million in common stock. On August 4, 2011, the Company announced additional share repurchases of $250 million under the Capital Allocation Plan, bringing the total targeted share repurchases for 2011 to $430 million. During 2011, the Company repurchased 14,875,798 shares of NRG common stock for $320 million under two separate Accelerated Share Repurchase, or ASR, Agreements, and purchased an additional 5,099,856 shares for $110 million in open market purchases. The Companys share repurchases are subject to market prices, financial restrictions under the Companys debt facilities and securities laws.As part of the 2011 program, the Company invested approximately $389 million in maintenance and environmental capital expenditures in existing assets, and approximately $2.5 billion in solar and other projects under development. In 2011, the Company obtained U.S. DOE loan guarantees for its Ivanpah, Agua Caliente, and CVSR solar projects in the amounts of $1.6 billion, $967 million, and $1.2 billion, respectively.Finally, in addition to scheduled debt amortization payments, in the first quarter 2011 the Company paid its first lien lenders $149 million of its 2010 excess cash flow, as defined in the Senior Credit Facility.2012 Capital Allocation Program On February 28, 2012, the Company announced its intention to initiate an annual common stock dividend of $0.36 per share, with the first quarterly payment expected to be paid in the third quarter of 2012. Furthermore, the Company still intends to refinance its remaining $1.1 billion of 2017 Senior Notes to simplify its capital structure and better align covenant packages, but any refinancing will depend on market conditions and is therefore subject to change. Upon completion of this undertaking, a more flexible covenant package across credit facilities and debt securities will enable NRG to invest more opportunistically in growth initiatives and enhance its ability to efficiently return capital to all stockholders. Preferred Stock Dividend PaymentsFor the year ended December 31, 2011, NRG paid $9 million in dividend payments to holders of the Companys 3.625% Preferred Stock. 90Table of ContentsCash Flow DiscussionThe following table reflects the changes in cash flows for the comparative years: (In millions) Year ended December 31,2011 2010 ChangeNet cash provided by operating activities$1,166 $1,623 $(457)Net cash used by investing activities(3,047) (1,623) (1,424)Net cash provided by financing activities33 651 (618) Net Cash Provided By Operating ActivitiesChanges to net cash provided by operating activities were driven by:Decrease in operating income adjusted for non cash charges$(454)Other changes in working capital(3) $(457) Net Cash Used By Investing ActivitiesChanges to net cash used by investing activities were driven by:Increase in capital expenditures due to increased spending on maintenance, repowering and renewable development, primarily for solar projects in construction$(1,604)Increase in restricted cash, which was mainly to support equity requirements for U.S. DOE funded projects(246)Lower cash spent for acquisitions, which primarily reflects three Solar acquisitions and Energy Plus in 2011, compared to Green Mountain, South Trent, Northwind Phoenix and Cottonwood in 2010629Decrease in purchases and sales of emissions allowances15Decrease in cash for sale of assets, which primarily reflects sale of land in 2011, compared to the sale of Padoma in 2010(36)Receipt of cash grants in 2010(102)Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, primarily related to investments in a clean technology joint venture and Petra Nova(43)Other(37) $(1,424) Net Cash Provided By Financing ActivitiesChanges in net cash provided by financing activities were driven by:Increase in cash paid to repurchase shares of NRG common stock$(250)Increase in net cash paid/received for the settlement of acquired derivatives with financing elements(220)Increase in cash paid for debt issuance and hedging costs(132)Net increase in cash received for proceeds for issuance of long term debt4,740Net increase in the payments of debt, primarily related to payment of secured Senior Notes(4,735)Decrease in cash contributions from noncontrolling interest(21) $(618)91Table of ContentsNOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications, under ASC 740As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a total domestic pre tax book loss of $680 million and foreign pre tax book income of $34 million. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company generated a net operating loss, or NOL, of $30 million which is available to offset taxable income in future periods. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has cumulative domestic NOL carryforwards of $233 million for financial statement purposes. In addition, NRG has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $255 million, of which $77 million will expire starting 2012 through 2019 and of which $178 million do not have an expiration date.In addition to these amounts, the Company has $178 million of tax effected uncertain tax benefits. As a result of the Companys tax position, and based on current forecasts, NRG anticipates income tax payments, primarily due to foreign, state and local jurisdictions, of up to $50 million in 2012.However, as the position remains uncertain for the $178 million of tax effected uncertain tax benefits, the Company has recorded a non current tax liability of $58 million and may accrue the remaining balance as an increase to non current liabilities until final resolution with the related taxing authority. The $58 million non current tax liability for uncertain tax benefits is primarily from positions taken on various state returns, including accrued interest.During 2011, the Company settled the Internal Revenue Services audit examination for the years 2004 through 2006 and recognized a benefit of $633 million. The benefit is predominantly due to the recognition of previously uncertain tax benefits mainly composed of net operating losses of $536 million which had been classified as capital loss carryforwards for financial statement purposes.The Company continues to be under examination for various state jurisdictions for multiple years.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsObligations under Certain Guarantee ContractsNRG and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include financial and performance guarantees, stand by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. See also Item 15 Note 26, Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.Retained or Contingent InterestsNRG does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.Derivative Instrument ObligationsThe Companys 3.625% Preferred Stock includes a feature which is considered an embedded derivative per ASC 815. Although it is considered an embedded derivative, it is exempt from derivative accounting as it is excluded from the scope pursuant to ASC 815. As of December 31, 2011, based on the Companys stock price, the embedded derivative was out of the money and had no redemption value. See also Item 15 Note 15, Capital Structure, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.Obligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated EntityVariable interest in Equity investments As of December 31, 2011, NRG has several investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy related entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Several of these investments are variable interest entities for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary.NRGs pro rata share of non recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $244 million as of December 31, 2011. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to NRG. See also Item 15 Note 16, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.92Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and Commercial CommitmentsNRG has a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to the Companys capital expenditure programs.

In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the Companys variable rate and fixed rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements.NRGs trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Companys Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.The tables below disclose the activities that include both exchange and non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2011, based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2011.

Also, collateral received or paid on the Companys derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Companys portfolio. As discussed in Item 7A Commodity Price Risk, NRG measures the sensitivity of the Companys portfolio to potential changes in market prices using Value at Risk, or VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. NRGs risk management policy places a limit on one day holding period VaR, which limits the Companys net open position. As the Companys trade by trade derivative accounting results in a gross up of the Companys derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of NRGs hedging activity. As of December 31, 2011, NRGs net derivative asset was $451 million, a decrease to total fair value of $221 million as compared to December 31, 2010. This decrease was primarily driven by the roll off of contracts that settled during the period offset by an increase in fair value due to the decreases in gas and power prices.Based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $1 per MMBtu increase or decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would cause a change of approximately $35 million in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2011.94Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesNRGs discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with U.S. GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed.On an ongoing basis, NRG evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Companys estimates. Any effects on the Companys business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.NRGs significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Companys financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

ASC 815 requires the Company to mark to market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet, and recognize changes in the fair value of non hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings. In certain cases, NRG may apply hedge accounting to the Companys derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives instruments accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item, or deferred and recorded as a component of Other Comprehensive Income, or OCI, and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur.For purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, NRG uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes. When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models to determine the fair value. These internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. In order to qualify derivative instruments for hedged transactions, NRG estimates the forecasted generation occurring within a specified time period. Judgments related to the probability of forecasted generation occurring are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation, and historical physical delivery on similar contracts. The probability that hedged forecasted generation will occur by the end of a specified time period could change the results of operations by requiring amounts currently classified in OCI to be reclassified into earnings, creating increased variability in the Companys earnings. These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.Certain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be Normal Purchase Normal Sale, or NPNS. The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that NRG has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on available baseload capacity, internal forecasts of sales and generation and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment, and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax AssetsAs of December 31, 2011, NRG had a valuation allowance of $83 million. This amount is comprised of foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $71 million, foreign capital loss carryforwards of approximately $1 million and U.S. domestic state NOLs of $11 million. In assessing the recoverability of NRGs deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon earnings in foreign jurisdictions. NRG continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in other jurisdictions. Considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. NRG is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including operations located in Germany and Australia. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2007. With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2003. The Companys significant foreign operations are also no longer subject to examination by local jurisdictions for years prior to 2004.96Table of ContentsEvaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other Than Temporary Decline in ValueIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, or ASC 360, NRG evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are:Significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset;Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;Adverse business climate;Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;Current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; andChange in the Companys intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long term power pool prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Companys estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material.For assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value under ASC 360, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held for sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. NRG considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence of such information, the Company may consider prices of similar assets, consult with brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. NRG will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability weights a range of possible outcomes. The use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in the Companys estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material.NRG is also required to evaluate its equity method and cost method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired. ASC 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures, or ASC 323, provides the accounting requirements for these investments. The standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under ASC 323 is whether the value is considered an "other than a temporary" decline in value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under ASC 323 involves the same uncertainties as described for long lived assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with ASC 360. Similarly, the estimates that NRG makes with respect to its equity and cost method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which the Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of ASC 360, NRG would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other than temporary decline in value under ASC 323.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsAt December 31, 2011, NRG reported goodwill of $1.9 billion, consisting of $1.7 billion in its Texas operating segment, or NRG Texas, that is associated with the acquisition of Texas Genco in 2006, and $144 million and $29 million in its corporate operating segment that is associated with the acquisition of Green Mountain Energy in November 2010 and Energy Plus in September 2011, respectively. The Company has also recorded intangible assets in connection with its business acquisitions, measured primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. See Item 15 Note 3, Business Acquisitions and Dispositions, and Note 11, Goodwill and Other Intangibles, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.97Table of ContentsThe Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805, and ASC 350, to account for its goodwill and intangible assets. Under these standards, the Company amortizes all finite lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. However, goodwill and all intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairments at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the Companys operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In 2011, NRG adopted the provisions of ASU 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment, or ASU 2011 08, which allows the consideration of qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, goodwill impairment is determined utilizing a two step process. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, where necessary, the Companys goodwill and or intangible asset with indefinite lives will be impaired at that time.The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2011, based on its qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry, and market events and circumstances as well as the overall financial performance subsequent to the November 2010 and September 2011 acquisition dates of the Green Mountain Energy and Energy Plus reporting units, respectively, the Company determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill attributed to these reporting units was less than its carrying amount; as such, the annual two step impairment test was deemed not necessary to be performed for these reporting units for the year ended December 31, 2011.The Company performed step one of the two step impairment test for its Texas reporting unit, NRG Texas, which is at the operating segment level. The Company determined the fair value of this reporting unit using primarily an income approach and then applied an overall market approach reasonableness test to reconcile that fair value with NRGs overall market capitalization. The Company believes the methodology and assumptions used in the valuation are consistent with the views of market participants. Significant inputs to the determination of fair value were as follows:For the three solid fuel baseload plants that drive a majority of the value in the reporting unit, and for the regions Elbow Creek, Langford, Cedar Bayou and South Trent facilities, the Company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to their long term budgets. This approach is consistent with that used to determine fair value in prior years. These budgets are based on the Companys views of power and fuel prices, which consider market prices in the near term and the Companys fundamental view for the longer term as some relevant market prices are illiquid beyond 24 months. Hedging is included to the extent of contracts already in place. Projected generation in the long term budgets is based on managements estimate of supply and demand within the sub markets for each plant and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant;For the reporting units remaining gas plants, the Company applied a market derived earnings multiple to the gas plants aggregate estimated 2011 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. This approach is consistent with that used to determine fair values in prior years; andThe intangible value to NRG Texas for synergies it provides to the Retail Businesses was determined by capitalizing estimated annual collateral charge and supply cost savings. Under step one, if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. Under the income approach described above, the Company estimated the fair value of NRG Texas invested capital to exceed its carrying value by approximately 12% at December 31, 2011. The Company also evaluated various market derived data including market research forecasts, recent merger and acquisition activity and earnings multiples, and together with its estimate of fair value, concluded that NRG Texass goodwill is not impaired at December 31, 2011.98Table of ContentsTo reconcile the fair value determined under the income approach with NRGs market capitalization, the Company considered historical and future budgeted earnings measures to estimate the average percentage of total company value represented by NRG Texas, and applied this percentage to an adjusted business enterprise value of NRG. To derive this adjusted business enterprise value, the Company applied a range of control premiums based on recent market transactions to the business enterprise value of NRG on a non controlling, marketable basis, and also made adjustments for some non operating assets and for some of the significant factors that impact NRG differently from NRG Texas, such as environmental capital expenditures outside of the Texas region on NRGs stock price. The Company also qualitatively considered the impact on its stock price of shorter term market views about forward natural gas prices. The Company was able to reconcile the proportional value of NRG Texas to NRGs market capitalization at a value that would not indicate an impairment.The Companys estimate of fair value under the income approach described above is affected by assumptions about projected power prices, generation, fuel costs, capital expenditure requirements and environmental regulations, and the Company believes that the most significant impact arises from future power prices. The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates power plants. Due to recent downward trends in market natural gas prices, the Company performed a sensitivity scenario by using the quoted natural gas prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, as of December 31, 2011, and changes to the implied heat rate that would support new build of combined cycle gas plant in the Texas markets, coal and transportation charges, variable operations and maintenance costs, and the impact on forecasted generation for the baseload plants during the budget period. Under this sensitivity scenario, the fair value of NRG Texas was 16% below its carrying value at December 31, 2011. While not required, the Company further performed a high level hypothetical step two analysis for this sensitivity scenario. Step two requires an allocation of fair value to the individual asset and liabilities using a hypothetical purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded. Under the hypothetical step two for the sensitivity scenario it was determined that no goodwill impairment was necessary as of December 31, 2011. If long term natural gas prices remain depressed for an extended period of time, the Companys goodwill may become impaired in the future, which would result in a non cash charge, not to exceed $1.7 billion, related to the NRG Texas reporting unit.ContingenciesNRG records a loss contingency when management determines it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Recent Accounting DevelopmentsSee Item 15 Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments.99Table of ContentsItem 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NRG is exposed to several market risks in the Companys normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with the Companys merchant power generation or with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transaction. The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and currency exchange risk. In order to manage these risks the Company uses various fixed price forward purchase and sales contracts, futures and option contracts traded on NYMEX, and swaps and options traded in the over the counter financial markets to:Manage and hedge fixed price purchase and sales commitments;Manage and hedge exposure to variable rate debt obligations;Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices, andHedge fuel requirements for the Companys generating facilities.Commodity Price RiskCommodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices, volatilities, and correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal, oil, and emissions credits. NRG manages the commodity price risk of the Companys merchant generation operations and load serving obligations by entering into various derivative or non derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales and purchases of electricity and fuel. These instruments include forwards, futures, swaps, and option contracts traded on various exchanges, such as NYMEX and Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, as well as over the counter markets. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon managements assessment of market, weather, operation and other factors. While some of the contracts the Company uses to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources, other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices, contract quantities, or both. NRG uses the Companys best estimates to determine the fair value of those derivative contracts. However, it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording mark to market derivative instrument valuation, and such variations could be material.NRG measures the risk of the Companys portfolio using several analytical methods, including sensitivity tests, scenario tests, stress tests, position reports, and Value at Risk, or VaR. NRG uses a Monte Carlo simulation based VaR model to estimate the potential loss in the fair value of the Companys energy assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, load obligations, and bilateral physical and financial transactions. The key assumptions for the Companys VaR model include: (i) lognormal distribution of prices; (ii) one day holding period; (iii) 95% confidence interval; (iv) rolling 36 month forward looking period; and (v) market implied volatilities and historical price correlations. As of December 31, 2011, the VaR for NRGs commodity portfolio, including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions calculated using the VaR model, was $45 million. The following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VaR for NRG for the years ended December 31, 2011, and 2010:(In millions)2011 2010VaR as of December 31,$45 $50For the year ended December 31, Average$60 $54Maximum77 70Minimum44 37Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as VaR, the evolving nature of the competitive markets for electricity and related derivatives, and the seasonality of changes in market prices, the VaR calculation may not capture the full extent of commodity price exposure. As a result, actual changes in the fair value of mark to market energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated VaR, and such changes could have a material impact on the Companys financial results.100Table of Contents In order to provide additional information for comparative purposes to NRGs peers, the Company also uses VaR to estimate the potential loss of derivative financial instruments that are subject to mark to market accounting. These derivative instruments include transactions that were entered into for both asset management and trading purposes. The VaR for the derivative financial instruments calculated using the diversified VaR model as of December 31, 2011, for the entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset management and trading, was $13 million primarily driven by asset backed transactions.Interest Rate RiskNRG is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through the Companys issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument. NRGs risk management policies allow the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations.NRG entered into interest rate swaps, which became effective on April 1, 2011, and are intended to hedge the risks associated with floating interest rates. For the interest rate swaps, the Company will pay its counterparty the equivalent of a fixed interest payment on a predetermined notional value, and NRG receives the monthly equivalent of a floating interest payment based on a 1 month London Inter Bank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, calculated on the same notional value. All interest rate swap payments by NRG and its counterparties are made monthly and the LIBOR is determined in advance of each interest period. The total notional amount of the swaps, which mature on February 1, 2013, is $900 million. In addition to those discussed above, the Companys project subsidiaries enter into interest rate swaps, intended to hedge the risks associated with interest rates on non recourse project level debt. See Item 15 Note 12, Debt and Capital Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information about interest rate swaps of the Companys project subsidiaries. If all of the above swaps had been discontinued on December 31, 2011, the Company would have owed the counterparties $100 million. Based on the investment grade rating of the counterparties, NRG believes its exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by counterparties to its hedge contracts to be insignificant.As part of the CVSR financing, the Company entered into swaptions with a notional value of $686 million in order to hedge the project interest rate risk. If the swaptions were discontinued on December 31, 2011, the counterparty would have owed the Company approximately $27 million.NRG has both long and short term debt instruments that subject the Company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2011, a 1% change in interest rates would result in an $8 million change in interest expense on a rolling twelve month basis.As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of the Companys debt was equal to its carrying value of $9.7 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Companys long term debt by $797 million.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of NRGs activities and in the management of the Companys assets and liabilities. The Company is currently exposed to additional collateral posting if natural gas prices decline primarily due to the long natural gas equivalent position at various exchanges used to hedge NRGs retail supply load obligations. Based on a sensitivity analysis for power and gas positions under marginable contracts, a $1 per MMBtu change in natural gas prices across the term of the marginable contracts would cause a change in margin collateral posted of approximately $123 million as of December 31, 2011 and a 1.25 MMBtu/MWh change in heat rates for heat rate positions would result in a change in margin collateral posted of approximately $68 million as of December 31, 2011. This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated based on portfolio composition and margin related contract provisions as of December 31, 2011.Counterparty Credit RiskCredit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non performance or non payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; (ii) a daily monitoring of counterparties credit limits; (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and (v) the 101Table of Contentsuse of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at NRG to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle. As of December 31, 2011, counterparty credit exposure to a significant portion of the Companys counterparties was $1.2 billion and NRG held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of $261 million resulting in a net exposure of $919 million. Counterparty credit exposure is discounted at the risk free rate. The following table highlights the credit quality and the net counterparty credit exposure by industry sector. Net counterparty credit exposure is defined as the aggregate net asset position for NRG with counterparties where netting is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark to market and NPNS, and non derivative transactions. As of December 31, 2011, the exposure is shown net of collateral held, and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.CategoryNet Exposure (a)(% of Total)Financial institutions57%Utilities, energy merchants, marketers and other39Coal and emissions1ISOs3Total100% CategoryNet Exposure (a)(% of Total)Investment grade70%Non rated (b)27Non Investment grade3Total100%(a)Counterparty credit exposure excludes uranium and coal transportation contracts because of the unavailability of market prices.(b)For non rated counterparties, the majority are related to ISO and municipal public power entities, which are considered investment grade equivalent ratings based on NRGs internal credit ratings. 102Table of ContentsNRG has credit risk exposure to certain wholesale counterparties representing more than 10% of the total net exposure discussed above and the aggregate of credit risk exposure to such counterparties was $265 million. Approximately 89% of NRGs positions relating to this credit risk roll off by the end of 2013. Changes in hedge positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty concentration. Given the credit quality, diversification and term of the exposure in the portfolio, NRG does not anticipate a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations from nonperformance by any of NRGs counterparties. Counterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long term contracts, including California tolling agreements, South Central load obligations, solar PPAs and a coal supply agreement. As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company valued these contracts based on various techniques including but not limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. Based on these valuation techniques, as of December 31, 2011, credit risk exposure to these counterparties is approximately $866 million for the next five years. This amount excludes potential credit exposures for projects with long term PPAs that have not reached commercial operations. Many of these power contracts are with utilities or public power entities that have strong credit quality and specific public utility commission or other regulatory support. In the case of the coal supply agreement, NRG holds a lien against the underlying asset. These factors significantly reduce the risk of loss.Retail Customer Credit Risk NRG is exposed to retail credit risk through its retail electricity providers, which serve C&I customers and the Mass market. Retail credit risk results when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses could be incurred from nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and any in the money forward value. NRG manages retail credit risk through the use of established credit policies that include monitoring of the portfolio, and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements. As of December 31, 2011, the Companys credit exposure to C&I customers was diversified across many customers and various industries, with a significant portion of the exposure with government entities. NRG is also exposed to credit risk relating to its Mass customers, which may result in a write off of bad debt. During 2011, the Company continued to experience improved customer payment behavior, but current economic conditions may affect the Companys customers ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in bad debt expense.Credit Risk Related Contingent Features Certain of the Companys hedging agreements contain provisions that require the Company to post additional collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been deterioration in credit quality, generally termed "adequate assurance" under the agreements, or require the Company to post additional collateral if there were a one notch downgrade in the Companys credit rating. The collateral required for contracts that have adequate assurance clauses that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2011, was $69 million. The collateral required for contracts with credit rating contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2011, was $35 million. The Company is also a party to certain marginable agreements where NRG has a net liability position but the counterparty has not called for the collateral due, which is approximately $15 million as of December 31, 2011.Currency Exchange RiskNRGs foreign earnings and investments may be subject to foreign currency exchange risk, which NRG generally does not hedge. As these earnings and investments are not material to NRGs consolidated results, the Companys foreign currency exposure is limited.103Table of Contents
