Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes beginning on Page 51 and the Five Year Financial Review beginning on Page 23. SUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2001 Compared with 2000 Net income in 2001 was $375 million, up 118%. Results in 2001 included a $13 million gain related to the 1998 sale of NS former motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). Income from continuing operations, which excludes that gain, was $362 million, up 110%. Results in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force, which reduced income from continuing operations by $101 million, or 26 cents per diluted share. Excluding these costs, income from continuing operations increased $89 million, or 33%, in 2001. The improvement resulted from higher income from railway operations, which was up $209 million, or 26%, that more than offset lower nonoperating income, which was down $69 million (see Note 3 on Page 61). Diluted earnings per share were 97 cents, up 116%. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 94 cents, up 109%. Excluding the work force reduction costs in 2000, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 32%. 2000 Compared with 1999 Results for 2000 reflected the first full year of operations over Conrails lines. On June 1, 1999 (the Closing Date), NS railroad subsidiary (Norfolk Southern Railway Company [NSR]) began operating a substantial portion of Conrails properties (substantially all of which comprise NSRs Northern Region) under various agreements with Pennsylvania Lines LLC (PRR), a wholly owned subsidiary of Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC) (see Note 2 on Page 58). As a result, both the railroad route miles operated by NSR and the number of its railroad employees increased by approximately 50% on that date. Results for 1999 reflect five months (January through May) of operating the former Norfolk Southern railroad system and seven months (June through December) of operating the present system, which includes the Northern Region. Results in 1999 were adversely affected by difficulties encountered in the assimilation of the Northern Region into NSRs existing system that resulted in system congestion, an increase in cars on line, increased terminal dwell time and reduced system velocity. These service issues and actions taken to address them increased operating expenses, primarily labor costs and equipment costs, including car hire and locomotive rentals. Moreover, revenues were lower than expected as some customers diverted traffic to other modes of transportation. 26 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Net income in 2000 was $172 million, down 28%. Excluding the $101 million after tax cost of the work force reductions, net income would have been $273 million, up 14%. The increase resulted from gains from the sale of nonoperating properties (see Note 3 on Page 61) and higher income from railway operations, compared with a weak 1999. Diluted earnings per share were 45 cents, down 29%. Excluding the effects of the work force reduction costs, diluted earnings per share were up 13%. DETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Railway Operating Revenues Railway operating revenues were $6.2 billion in both 2001 and 2000, and were $5.2 billion in 1999. Revenues in 1999 include results of operations in the Northern Region for seven months. The following table presents a three year comparison of revenues by market group. RAILWAY OPERATIING REVENUES BY MARKET GROUP ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 Coal $ 1,521 $ 1,435 $ 1,322 General merchandise: Automotive 885 921 746 Chemicals 752 756 641 Metals/construction 674 689 567 Paper/clay/forest 612 630 578 Agriculture/consumer products/government 603 609 539 General merchandise 3,526 3,605 3,071 Intermodal 1,123 1,119 849 Total $ 6,170 $ 6,159 $ 5,242 In 2001, revenues fell for all the general merchandise market groups. However, a 6% increase in coal revenues offset the effects of the lower general merchandise revenues. As shown in the following table, higher revenue yields offset the effects of lower traffic volume. RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUE VARIANCE ANALYSIS Increases (Decreases) ($ in millions) 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 Volume $ (200) $ 779 Revenue per unit/mix 211 138 Total $ 11 $ 917 27 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Revenue per unit increased in all market groups, principally due to rate increases, use of higher capacity equipment and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, revenues increased for all market groups, reflecting a full year of handling Northern Region traffic. Revenues improved for the last seven months, a comparison that fully includes the Northern Region in both years, reflecting recovery of most of the diverted traffic and new business. However, weakness in the economy resulted in lower revenues very late in the year. Revenue per unit improved in most market groups, principally due to the effects of Northern Region traffic and increased rates. About half of the revenue per unit increase for the intermodal market group was attributable to the effects of the consolidation of Triple Crown Services Company (TCS) revenues (see discussion of intermodal revenues below). COAL tonnage increased 2% in 2001 and revenues increased 6%. Revenue per unit increased 6%, a result of rate increases, including lower volume related refunds on export coal shipments, gains in tonnage per car and favorable changes to the mix of traffic (less shorter haul business). Coal, coke and iron ore revenues represented 25% of total railway operating revenues in 2001, and 83% of NS coal shipments originated on lines it operated. In 2000, coal tonnage increased 11%, and revenues increased 9%, reflecting a full year of Northern Region traffic. Revenue per unit declined, a result of a higher proportion of traffic with a shorter length of haul, principally attributable to a full year of Northern Region operations. TOTAL COAL, COKE AND IRON ORE TONNAGE (In millions of tons) 2001 2000 1999 Utility 133 119 108 Export 14 20 18 Domestic metallurgical 20 25 22 Other 11 11 10 Total 178 175 158 Utility coal traffic increased 11% in 2001, reflecting higher demand for coal fired electricity and the effects of very high natural gas prices early in the year. High demand for electricity, a volatile market for natural gas and production problems at a number of large mines in the East late in 2000 combined to increase the demand for coal early in 2001 with a resulting increase in coal prices. Utility coal traffic volume also benefited from the shifting of coal that traditionally would have been bound for export to the domestic market. In 2000, utility coal traffic increased 11%, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations. The effects of expanded operations were somewhat offset by coal production problems at several NS served mines, unanticipated outages at some NS served utility plants, large stockpiles at the beginning of the year and mild summer weather in portions of NS service territory. The near term outlook for utility coal remains positive. U.S. demand for electricity continues to grow rapidly, and coal fired generation remains the cheapest marginal source of electricity. Several underutilized coal fired power plants are making the transition 28 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) from peak only generation to full time generation. In addition, although natural gas prices have returned to more normal levels, the volatility of natural gas prices may improve the long term competitive position of coal fired generation. Phase II of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which imposes more stringent limits on sulfur dioxide emissions, took effect on Jan. 1, 2000. Many of the mines served by NS produce coals that satisfy Phase II requirements. In addition, substantial banks of sulfur dioxide allowances held by many NS served utilities should continue to provide a market for other NS served mines for many years. However, several federal environmental regulatory initiatives continued to be pursued during 2001, including "new source review" for older coal fired plants. Many of the rules that have been promulgated to date are in litigation. If the rules survive litigation and are implemented, they could increase the cost of coal fired generation and potentially adversely affect the value of the sulfur dioxide allowance bank. The Bush Administration rejected in 2001 the Kyoto Protocol and withdrew U.S. participation in that process. If implemented, the proposed Kyoto limits on greenhouse gases could have put additional cost pressures on coal fired generation. The U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto process has renewed interest in building coal fired generation plants. The 1999 decision by a federal district court judge in West Virginia holding that some common mountaintop mining practices in the coal industry are illegal was overturned in April 2001 by the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In January 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the case. Export coal tonnage declined 30% in 2001. The rapid rise of domestic utility coal prices early in the year enticed many foreign market suppliers to place much of their 2001 production in the domestic utility markets. In addition, production difficulties at several large NS served mines and flooding in West Virginia in July significantly reduced the supply of low volatile coal. The combination of these factors resulted in most of the decline in shipments of export coal. Steam coal exported through Baltimore declined 32%, and export metallurgical coals through Norfolk declined by 30%. Demand for steam coal to export strengthened in the last half of 2001; however, the strong U.S. demand limited NS participation in this market. Demand for coking coal to export continued to soften, as steel production moved from traditional NS markets in Europe to Asia, which in recent years has been supplied by Australian or Canadian coals. In 2000, export coal tonnage increased 8%, a result of a full year of access to Baltimore through the Northern Region, mitigated by lower tonnage through Norfolk. Several additional factors also adversely affected export coal traffic volume. Delayed settlements between buyers and sellers in the spring postponed shipments of some export tonnage. Foreign buyers ultimately intended to purchase additional U.S. metallurgical coal, but production capacity available for export had been diminished by two years of dramatically lower prices. Toward the end of 2000, production difficulties at several large NS served mines significantly reduced tonnage available for export. Limited supplies overall prevented other coal producers from providing substitute coal. Export coal tonnage is expected to continue to be limited by supply and subject to the fluctuations of the world market. While the consolidation of Australian producers should help stabilize that supply channel, new Australian production could displace U.S. 29 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) volumes to Europe absent any increase in demand. Moreover, Chinese participation in Pacific Rim markets could displace Australian coals there and force that tonnage to Europe. Domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic decreased 18% in 2001, due to a decline in the market for domestic steel. The softening economy and an increase in steel imports drastically cut blast furnace production, sharply reducing the demand for coking coal, iron ore and coke. The increase in imported steel also resulted in lower prices that put pressure on the U.S. steel industry and led to plant closures and bankruptcies that included some NS customers. In 2000, domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic increased 17%, due to a full year of Northern Region operations. In addition, increased production in the first half of the year and gains in NS market share contributed to the higher traffic. However, the softening economy and increased steel imports diminished blast furnace production rates, sharply reducing demand for raw materials. Domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic is expected to continue to suffer from the decline in demand for domestically produced steel. However, the United States has applied a tariff on imported coke, which has reduced its entry to the U.S. market. Moreover, the U.S. International Trade Commission has recommended that President Bush take similar action on imported steel. But long term demand is expected to continue to decline, due to advanced technologies that allow production of steel using less coke. Other coal traffic, principally steam coal shipped to manufacturing plants, increased 6% in 2001 and 4% in 2000. The gain in 2001 resulted from new and increased business from industrial customers. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of handling Northern Region traffic; however, this was mitigated by the loss of some traffic to competitors. COAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $1,521 $1,435 $1,322 Revenues increased $86 million, or 6%, in 2001, primarily due to increased utility coal traffic volume and higher revenue per unit. This group includes utility coal, export coal, domestic metallurgical coal and industrial coal, coke and iron ore. GENERAL MERCHANDISE traffic volume (carloads) decreased 7% in 2001, and revenues decreased 2%, principally due to the effects of the weak economy. In 2000, traffic volume increased 15%, and revenues increased 17%, reflecting a full year of operating the Northern Region. 30 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Automotive traffic volume decreased 10%, and revenues declined 4% in 2001, principally due to a 10% drop in vehicle production. Revenue per unit increased 7%, principally due to rate increases, efficiencies gained from the redesign of the mixing center network and use of higher capacity equipment. In 2000, automotive traffic volume increased 13%, and revenues increased 23%, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations, record vehicle production and the recapture of business diverted because of service issues after the Closing Date. The carload increase was less than the revenue increase principally due to the effects of a redesign of the mixing center network. This redesign improves vehicle velocity through the network and includes changes in traffic flows that resulted in a decline in carloads, with no corresponding decrease in revenues. Ford Motor Company, NS largest customer, has announced potential reductions in vehicle production which could affect NS volumes. However, automotive revenues in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those of 2001, as light vehicle production is predicted to be flat. AUTOMOTIVE (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 885 $ 921 $ 746 Revenues decreased $36 million, or 4%, in 2001, due to a 10% drop in traffic volume. Revenue per unit increased, principally due to rate increases and improved efficiency. This group includes finished vehicles for BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Isuzu, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saab, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Mercedes Benz and Toyota. Chemicals traffic volume decreased 5%, and revenues decreased 1% in 2001. The weak economy depressed shipments of petroleum, plastics, industrial and miscellaneous chemicals. These declines were partially offset by new business through NS Thoroughbred Bulk Transfer (TBT) facilities that handle chemicals and bulk commodities for customers not located on NS served lines. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and a favorable change in the mix of traffic (more longer haul moves). In 2000, chemicals traffic volume increased 15%, and revenues increased 18%, due to a full year of Northern Region operations and the return of traffic that had been diverted because of service issues after the Closing Date. Shipments of miscellaneous chemicals, chlorine, caustic soda and plastics continued to rebound, but sulfur carloads were down due to weak fertilizer markets. Chemicals shipments continued to increase through NS TBT facilities. Chemicals revenues are expected to continue to be adversely affected until the economy recovers. However, NS expects to benefit from new business and improved yields. 31 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) CHEMICALS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 752 $ 756 $ 641 Revenues decreased $4 million, or 1%, in 2001, due to lower traffic volumes that resulted from the weak economy. This group includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes and municipal wastes. Metals and construction traffic volume decreased 7%, and revenues declined 2% in 2001, reflecting weakness in the steel and construction industries. The steel industry recession, which began in 2000, has resulted in excess capacity and the closing of numerous steel mills. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, metals and construction traffic volume increased 29%, and revenues increased 22%, reflecting a full year of operations over the expanded system. Revenue per unit declined, largely due to a change in the mix of traffic. Metals traffic benefited from increased shipments of sheet steel, imported slab steel and ferrous scrap; however, this was tempered by a significant slowdown in the steel industry in the last half of the year. Construction traffic benefited from continued strength in housing starts and highway construction. Metals and construction revenues are expected to suffer from the effects of a continued softness in the steel market. However, increased highway construction in NS service area is expected to mitigate the drop in metals demand. METALS AND CONSTRUCTION (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 674 $ 689 $ 567 Revenues decreased $15 million, or 2%, in 2001, principally due to weakness in the steel industry. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. This group includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks and minerals. Paper, clay and forest products traffic volume declined 8%, and revenues decreased 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Paper shipments were adversely affected by reduced production at many NS served paper mills, a result of sluggish newspaper advertising and soft demand for paper. Lumber traffic began the year weak, 32 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) improved in late summer, but softened late in the year due to short term weakness in housing starts. Revenue per unit increased principally due to higher rates. In 2000, paper, clay and forest products traffic volume increased 5%, and revenues increased 9%, principally due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations. Consolidation in the paper industry and a weakening paper market in the second half of the year contributed to lower carloads during the summer months and into the fall. Weak demand for paper production inputs, such as scrap paper and wood pulp, was tempered by stronger demand for newsprint and printing paper. Paper, clay and forest products revenues are expected to continue to be adversely affected by weak demand in 2002, due to continued consolidations and little anticipated capacity expansion through 2003. NS is pursuing new business using MODALGISTICS(SM), its supply chain focused business unit formed in February 2001. PAPER, CLAY AND FOREST PRODUCTS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 612 $ 630 $ 578 Revenues decreased $18 million, or 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Revenue per unit benefited from higher rates. This group includes lumber and wood products, pulpboard and paper products, woodfibers, woodpulp, scrap paper and clay. NS serves 66 paper mills, 105 paper distribution centers and more than 100 lumber reload centers. Agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume decreased 3%, and revenues declined 1% in 2001, primarily due to reduced shipments of fertilizer. This decline was due to soft farm demand, record high natural gas prices early in the year (which curtailed production of certain fertilizers) and increased imports. This was mitigated by traffic volume increases for grain, flour, wheat and canned goods. The revenue per unit increase was primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume increased 7%, and revenues increased 13%, due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region traffic and modest growth in the Southeast markets. Rate increases and more longer haul (higher revenue per unit) traffic also contributed to the revenue increase. Grain traffic benefited from new shuttle train service that improved service to new and expanded Southeast feed mills. In addition, traffic increased for Midwest grain and sweeteners and consumer goods from the West. Agriculture, consumer products and government revenues in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those of 2001. Continued weakness in the fertilizer market is expected to offset gains in the Southeast feed markets and new business. 33 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) AGRICULTURE, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND GOVERNMENT (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 603 $ 609 $ 539 Revenues decreased $6 million, or 1%, in 2001, principally due to soft farm demand, depressed fertilizer production and increased imports. This group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizers, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products and items for the military. INTERMODAL traffic volume decreased 1%, but revenues increased slightly in 2001. Domestic traffic volume was up in the first half of the year, but demand increasingly weakened as the year progressed, which eroded NS base of traffic. New business supported by the opening of three new terminals and other initiatives mitigated the effects of the weakened economy. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew slightly as U.S. imports slowed with the economy. TCS traffic volume increased 1% despite economic conditions, as it continued to benefit from reliable, trucklike service. Intermodal revenue per unit dropped later in the year, reflecting the expiration of fuel surcharges that were implemented late in 2000 and the introduction of new shorter haul business. In 2000, intermodal traffic volume increased 18%, and revenues increased 32%, primarily due to a full year of Northern Region traffic and the consolidation of TCS revenues (see Note 2 on Page 58). About half of the improvement in revenue per unit resulted from the effects of consolidating TCS. Prior to June 1, 1999, NS revenues included only the amounts for rail services it performed under contract to TCS, but NS volume included most TCS units. Also contributing to the revenue per unit improvement were rate increases throughout the year on domestic business and the implementation of fuel surcharges later in the year. In addition, increased demand, new business and improved service contributed to the gains, as major customers, including UPS, JB Hunt, Hub Group and Maersk, increased volumes. Despite weak demand in the first quarter and the loss in December 1999 of a major customer, NS had regained its market share by the second quarter. Domestic and premium business volumes benefited from service improvements and expansion initiatives. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew 5%, notwithstanding the loss of business from a major customer. TCS traffic increased 3%, as it recovered from service shortcomings after the Closing Date. Intermodal revenues are expected to benefit from continued improvements in service and the terminal capacity added in 2001. 34 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) INTERMODAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 1,123 $ 1,119 $ 849 Revenues increased $4 million in 2001, despite a 1% drop in traffic volume. This group handles trailers, domestic and international containers, TCS equipment and equipment for intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers and other shippers. Railway Operating Expenses Railway operating expenses decreased 7% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. Expenses in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force. Excluding these costs, railway operating expenses decreased 4% in 2001, while carloads dropped 3%; and increased 19% in 2000 on carloads that were 15% higher. The higher expense increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and sharply higher diesel fuel prices. The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, was 83.7% in 2001, compared with 87.0% in 2000 (excluding the work force reduction costs, which increased the ratio 2.7 percentage points) and 86.3% in 1999. The decline in the 2001 ratio reflected the increase in revenue per unit as well as reduced expenses that resulted from gains in efficiency. The increase in the 2000 ratio reflected the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the sharp increase in diesel fuel prices, which more than offset the absence of the significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues after the Closing Date. In addition, the ratio was adversely affected by a change in traffic mix (more resource intensive traffic, such as automotive and intermodal) and the new traffic in the Northern Region, coupled with the decrease in export coal traffic. 35 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications. RAILWAY OPERATING EXPENSES Increases (Decreases) ($ in millions) 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 Compensation and benefits * $ (220) $ 379 Materials, services and rents (1) 171 Conrail rents and services (57) 167 Depreciation 11 28 Diesel fuel (66) 223 Casualties and other claims 1 4 Other (31) 30 Total $ (363) $1,002 * Includes $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Compensation and benefits represented 39% of total railway operating expenses and decreased 10% in 2001, but increased 20% in 2000. Both comparisons reflect the $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Excluding those costs, compensation and benefits decreased 3% in 2001, but increased 12% in 2000. The 3% decline in 2001 reflected savings attributable to the reduced size of the work force. These savings were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees, higher incentive compensation and reduced pension income. The 12% increase in 2000 was largely attributable to the effects of a full year of expanded operations and higher wages and benefit costs for union employees. These increases were mitigated by higher pension income and the absence of the $49 million incurred in 1999 for the Special Work Incentive Program (SWIP) for union employees in the third quarter of 1999. Pension income was higher in 2000 largely due to the transfer of assets from the Conrail pension plan after the Closing Date. NS has substantial unrecognized gains related to its overfunded pension plan; amortization of these gains will continue to be included in "Compensation and benefits" expenses (see Note 11 on Page 68). The Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll taxes. The phase in calls for a reduction from 16.1% in 2001 to 15.6% in 2002, 14.2% in 2003 and 13.1% in 2004. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated. These changes are expected to result in a $21 million reduction to payroll tax expenses in 2002. The new law allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four year reserve or exceed a six year reserve. 36 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Materials, services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses decreased slightly in 2001, but increased 13% in 2000. In 2001, the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services, including expenses for software, consulting and legal fees. The increase in 2000 was mostly attributable to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the consolidation of TCS and was mitigated by the absence of significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 11% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases. The 2000 increase was principally due to the effects of a full year of expanded operations but was mitigated by a favorable comparison for the last seven months, as expenses in 1999 were high due to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Locomotive and equipment repair costs increased in 2001, principally due to renewed maintenance activity. This trend is expected to continue in 2002, driven by higher expenses for freight car repairs. In 2000, maintenance costs increased, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations; however, the increase was tempered by reduced maintenance activities, a result of cost control efforts. Conrail rents and services, a new category of expense beginning in 1999, arose from the expansion of operations on the Closing Date and amounted to $421 million in 2001, $478 million in 2000 and $311 million in 1999. This item includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRCs operation of the Shared Assets Areas. Also included is NS equity in Conrails net earnings since the Closing Date, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between NS investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2 on Page 58). The decline in 2001 reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see "Conrails Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity," below). Expenses in 2000 included a full year of operations over Conrails lines, compared with seven months in 1999. Depreciation expense was up 2% in 2001 and 6% in 2000. Increases in both years were due to property additions, reflecting substantial levels of capital spending (see Note 1, "Properties," on Page 57 for NS depreciation policy). A periodic review of depreciation rates is being finalized, and rates are expected to be somewhat lower. 37 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Diesel fuel expenses decreased 14% in 2001, but increased 87% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in 2001 include $8 million related to the hedging program initiated in the second quarter (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note 16 on Page 77). The increase in 2000 expenses resulted from a 61% rise in the average price per gallon and higher consumption that reflected a full year of Northern Region operations. Casualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased slightly in 2001 and 3% in 2000. The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2001, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 31% of the total employee injury cases settled and 15% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, promotes an adversarial claims environment and produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent. The railroads have been unsuccessful so far in efforts to persuade Congress to replace FELA with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2001, but increased 14% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to lower bad debt costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee relocation expenses. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and higher bad debt expense. Other Income Net Other income net was $99 million in 2001, $168 million in 2000 and $115 million in 1999 (see Note 3 on Page 61). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of certain timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests. This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December. The increase in 2000 reflected the $101 million of gains, mitigated by the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). 38 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2001 was $191 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 31% in 2000 and 32% in 1999. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2001 and 34% in both 2000 and 1999. The effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, both 2000 and 1999 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in 1981. In January 2001, NS received payment from the third party in accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $654 million in 2001, compared with $1.3 billion in 2000 and $533 million in 1999. Results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). Excluding the infusion of cash from this program, operating cash flow declined $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." In 2001, NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $250 million. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital, including an improvement in collection of accounts receivable, a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of bonus payments. The large changes in "Accounts receivable" and "Current liabilities other than debt" in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from the commencement of operations in the Northern Region. In addition, collection of accounts receivable had slowed. NS working capital deficit was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2000. The increase resulted principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. Part of the working capital deficit at Dec. 31, 2001, arises from a $373 million balance in "Notes and accounts payable to Conrail" that is not expected to be repaid in 2002. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part II, Item 7, "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on Page 44 under the heading "Market Risks and Hedging Activities." 49 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Net income in 2000 was $172 million, down 28%. Excluding the $101 million after tax cost of the work force reductions, net income would have been $273 million, up 14%. The increase resulted from gains from the sale of nonoperating properties (see Note 3 on Page 61) and higher income from railway operations, compared with a weak 1999. Diluted earnings per share were 45 cents, down 29%. Excluding the effects of the work force reduction costs, diluted earnings per share were up 13%. DETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Railway Operating Revenues Railway operating revenues were $6.2 billion in both 2001 and 2000, and were $5.2 billion in 1999. Revenues in 1999 include results of operations in the Northern Region for seven months. The following table presents a three year comparison of revenues by market group. RAILWAY OPERATIING REVENUES BY MARKET GROUP ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 Coal $ 1,521 $ 1,435 $ 1,322 General merchandise: Automotive 885 921 746 Chemicals 752 756 641 Metals/construction 674 689 567 Paper/clay/forest 612 630 578 Agriculture/consumer products/government 603 609 539 General merchandise 3,526 3,605 3,071 Intermodal 1,123 1,119 849 Total $ 6,170 $ 6,159 $ 5,242 In 2001, revenues fell for all the general merchandise market groups. However, a 6% increase in coal revenues offset the effects of the lower general merchandise revenues. As shown in the following table, higher revenue yields offset the effects of lower traffic volume. RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUE VARIANCE ANALYSIS Increases (Decreases) ($ in millions) 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 Volume $ (200) $ 779 Revenue per unit/mix 211 138 Total $ 11 $ 917 27 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Revenue per unit increased in all market groups, principally due to rate increases, use of higher capacity equipment and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, revenues increased for all market groups, reflecting a full year of handling Northern Region traffic. Revenues improved for the last seven months, a comparison that fully includes the Northern Region in both years, reflecting recovery of most of the diverted traffic and new business. However, weakness in the economy resulted in lower revenues very late in the year. Revenue per unit improved in most market groups, principally due to the effects of Northern Region traffic and increased rates. About half of the revenue per unit increase for the intermodal market group was attributable to the effects of the consolidation of Triple Crown Services Company (TCS) revenues (see discussion of intermodal revenues below). COAL tonnage increased 2% in 2001 and revenues increased 6%. Revenue per unit increased 6%, a result of rate increases, including lower volume related refunds on export coal shipments, gains in tonnage per car and favorable changes to the mix of traffic (less shorter haul business). Coal, coke and iron ore revenues represented 25% of total railway operating revenues in 2001, and 83% of NS coal shipments originated on lines it operated. In 2000, coal tonnage increased 11%, and revenues increased 9%, reflecting a full year of Northern Region traffic. Revenue per unit declined, a result of a higher proportion of traffic with a shorter length of haul, principally attributable to a full year of Northern Region operations. TOTAL COAL, COKE AND IRON ORE TONNAGE (In millions of tons) 2001 2000 1999 Utility 133 119 108 Export 14 20 18 Domestic metallurgical 20 25 22 Other 11 11 10 Total 178 175 158 Utility coal traffic increased 11% in 2001, reflecting higher demand for coal fired electricity and the effects of very high natural gas prices early in the year. High demand for electricity, a volatile market for natural gas and production problems at a number of large mines in the East late in 2000 combined to increase the demand for coal early in 2001 with a resulting increase in coal prices. Utility coal traffic volume also benefited from the shifting of coal that traditionally would have been bound for export to the domestic market. In 2000, utility coal traffic increased 11%, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations. The effects of expanded operations were somewhat offset by coal production problems at several NS served mines, unanticipated outages at some NS served utility plants, large stockpiles at the beginning of the year and mild summer weather in portions of NS service territory. The near term outlook for utility coal remains positive. U.S. demand for electricity continues to grow rapidly, and coal fired generation remains the cheapest marginal source of electricity. Several underutilized coal fired power plants are making the transition 28 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) from peak only generation to full time generation. In addition, although natural gas prices have returned to more normal levels, the volatility of natural gas prices may improve the long term competitive position of coal fired generation. Phase II of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which imposes more stringent limits on sulfur dioxide emissions, took effect on Jan. 1, 2000. Many of the mines served by NS produce coals that satisfy Phase II requirements. In addition, substantial banks of sulfur dioxide allowances held by many NS served utilities should continue to provide a market for other NS served mines for many years. However, several federal environmental regulatory initiatives continued to be pursued during 2001, including "new source review" for older coal fired plants. Many of the rules that have been promulgated to date are in litigation. If the rules survive litigation and are implemented, they could increase the cost of coal fired generation and potentially adversely affect the value of the sulfur dioxide allowance bank. The Bush Administration rejected in 2001 the Kyoto Protocol and withdrew U.S. participation in that process. If implemented, the proposed Kyoto limits on greenhouse gases could have put additional cost pressures on coal fired generation. The U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto process has renewed interest in building coal fired generation plants. The 1999 decision by a federal district court judge in West Virginia holding that some common mountaintop mining practices in the coal industry are illegal was overturned in April 2001 by the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In January 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the case. Export coal tonnage declined 30% in 2001. The rapid rise of domestic utility coal prices early in the year enticed many foreign market suppliers to place much of their 2001 production in the domestic utility markets. In addition, production difficulties at several large NS served mines and flooding in West Virginia in July significantly reduced the supply of low volatile coal. The combination of these factors resulted in most of the decline in shipments of export coal. Steam coal exported through Baltimore declined 32%, and export metallurgical coals through Norfolk declined by 30%. Demand for steam coal to export strengthened in the last half of 2001; however, the strong U.S. demand limited NS participation in this market. Demand for coking coal to export continued to soften, as steel production moved from traditional NS markets in Europe to Asia, which in recent years has been supplied by Australian or Canadian coals. In 2000, export coal tonnage increased 8%, a result of a full year of access to Baltimore through the Northern Region, mitigated by lower tonnage through Norfolk. Several additional factors also adversely affected export coal traffic volume. Delayed settlements between buyers and sellers in the spring postponed shipments of some export tonnage. Foreign buyers ultimately intended to purchase additional U.S. metallurgical coal, but production capacity available for export had been diminished by two years of dramatically lower prices. Toward the end of 2000, production difficulties at several large NS served mines significantly reduced tonnage available for export. Limited supplies overall prevented other coal producers from providing substitute coal. Export coal tonnage is expected to continue to be limited by supply and subject to the fluctuations of the world market. While the consolidation of Australian producers should help stabilize that supply channel, new Australian production could displace U.S. 29 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) volumes to Europe absent any increase in demand. Moreover, Chinese participation in Pacific Rim markets could displace Australian coals there and force that tonnage to Europe. Domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic decreased 18% in 2001, due to a decline in the market for domestic steel. The softening economy and an increase in steel imports drastically cut blast furnace production, sharply reducing the demand for coking coal, iron ore and coke. The increase in imported steel also resulted in lower prices that put pressure on the U.S. steel industry and led to plant closures and bankruptcies that included some NS customers. In 2000, domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic increased 17%, due to a full year of Northern Region operations. In addition, increased production in the first half of the year and gains in NS market share contributed to the higher traffic. However, the softening economy and increased steel imports diminished blast furnace production rates, sharply reducing demand for raw materials. Domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic is expected to continue to suffer from the decline in demand for domestically produced steel. However, the United States has applied a tariff on imported coke, which has reduced its entry to the U.S. market. Moreover, the U.S. International Trade Commission has recommended that President Bush take similar action on imported steel. But long term demand is expected to continue to decline, due to advanced technologies that allow production of steel using less coke. Other coal traffic, principally steam coal shipped to manufacturing plants, increased 6% in 2001 and 4% in 2000. The gain in 2001 resulted from new and increased business from industrial customers. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of handling Northern Region traffic; however, this was mitigated by the loss of some traffic to competitors. COAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $1,521 $1,435 $1,322 Revenues increased $86 million, or 6%, in 2001, primarily due to increased utility coal traffic volume and higher revenue per unit. This group includes utility coal, export coal, domestic metallurgical coal and industrial coal, coke and iron ore. GENERAL MERCHANDISE traffic volume (carloads) decreased 7% in 2001, and revenues decreased 2%, principally due to the effects of the weak economy. In 2000, traffic volume increased 15%, and revenues increased 17%, reflecting a full year of operating the Northern Region. 30 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Automotive traffic volume decreased 10%, and revenues declined 4% in 2001, principally due to a 10% drop in vehicle production. Revenue per unit increased 7%, principally due to rate increases, efficiencies gained from the redesign of the mixing center network and use of higher capacity equipment. In 2000, automotive traffic volume increased 13%, and revenues increased 23%, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations, record vehicle production and the recapture of business diverted because of service issues after the Closing Date. The carload increase was less than the revenue increase principally due to the effects of a redesign of the mixing center network. This redesign improves vehicle velocity through the network and includes changes in traffic flows that resulted in a decline in carloads, with no corresponding decrease in revenues. Ford Motor Company, NS largest customer, has announced potential reductions in vehicle production which could affect NS volumes. However, automotive revenues in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those of 2001, as light vehicle production is predicted to be flat. AUTOMOTIVE (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 885 $ 921 $ 746 Revenues decreased $36 million, or 4%, in 2001, due to a 10% drop in traffic volume. Revenue per unit increased, principally due to rate increases and improved efficiency. This group includes finished vehicles for BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Isuzu, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saab, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Mercedes Benz and Toyota. Chemicals traffic volume decreased 5%, and revenues decreased 1% in 2001. The weak economy depressed shipments of petroleum, plastics, industrial and miscellaneous chemicals. These declines were partially offset by new business through NS Thoroughbred Bulk Transfer (TBT) facilities that handle chemicals and bulk commodities for customers not located on NS served lines. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and a favorable change in the mix of traffic (more longer haul moves). In 2000, chemicals traffic volume increased 15%, and revenues increased 18%, due to a full year of Northern Region operations and the return of traffic that had been diverted because of service issues after the Closing Date. Shipments of miscellaneous chemicals, chlorine, caustic soda and plastics continued to rebound, but sulfur carloads were down due to weak fertilizer markets. Chemicals shipments continued to increase through NS TBT facilities. Chemicals revenues are expected to continue to be adversely affected until the economy recovers. However, NS expects to benefit from new business and improved yields. 31 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) CHEMICALS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 752 $ 756 $ 641 Revenues decreased $4 million, or 1%, in 2001, due to lower traffic volumes that resulted from the weak economy. This group includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes and municipal wastes. Metals and construction traffic volume decreased 7%, and revenues declined 2% in 2001, reflecting weakness in the steel and construction industries. The steel industry recession, which began in 2000, has resulted in excess capacity and the closing of numerous steel mills. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, metals and construction traffic volume increased 29%, and revenues increased 22%, reflecting a full year of operations over the expanded system. Revenue per unit declined, largely due to a change in the mix of traffic. Metals traffic benefited from increased shipments of sheet steel, imported slab steel and ferrous scrap; however, this was tempered by a significant slowdown in the steel industry in the last half of the year. Construction traffic benefited from continued strength in housing starts and highway construction. Metals and construction revenues are expected to suffer from the effects of a continued softness in the steel market. However, increased highway construction in NS service area is expected to mitigate the drop in metals demand. METALS AND CONSTRUCTION (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 674 $ 689 $ 567 Revenues decreased $15 million, or 2%, in 2001, principally due to weakness in the steel industry. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. This group includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks and minerals. Paper, clay and forest products traffic volume declined 8%, and revenues decreased 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Paper shipments were adversely affected by reduced production at many NS served paper mills, a result of sluggish newspaper advertising and soft demand for paper. Lumber traffic began the year weak, 32 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) improved in late summer, but softened late in the year due to short term weakness in housing starts. Revenue per unit increased principally due to higher rates. In 2000, paper, clay and forest products traffic volume increased 5%, and revenues increased 9%, principally due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations. Consolidation in the paper industry and a weakening paper market in the second half of the year contributed to lower carloads during the summer months and into the fall. Weak demand for paper production inputs, such as scrap paper and wood pulp, was tempered by stronger demand for newsprint and printing paper. Paper, clay and forest products revenues are expected to continue to be adversely affected by weak demand in 2002, due to continued consolidations and little anticipated capacity expansion through 2003. NS is pursuing new business using MODALGISTICS(SM), its supply chain focused business unit formed in February 2001. PAPER, CLAY AND FOREST PRODUCTS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 612 $ 630 $ 578 Revenues decreased $18 million, or 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Revenue per unit benefited from higher rates. This group includes lumber and wood products, pulpboard and paper products, woodfibers, woodpulp, scrap paper and clay. NS serves 66 paper mills, 105 paper distribution centers and more than 100 lumber reload centers. Agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume decreased 3%, and revenues declined 1% in 2001, primarily due to reduced shipments of fertilizer. This decline was due to soft farm demand, record high natural gas prices early in the year (which curtailed production of certain fertilizers) and increased imports. This was mitigated by traffic volume increases for grain, flour, wheat and canned goods. The revenue per unit increase was primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume increased 7%, and revenues increased 13%, due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region traffic and modest growth in the Southeast markets. Rate increases and more longer haul (higher revenue per unit) traffic also contributed to the revenue increase. Grain traffic benefited from new shuttle train service that improved service to new and expanded Southeast feed mills. In addition, traffic increased for Midwest grain and sweeteners and consumer goods from the West. Agriculture, consumer products and government revenues in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those of 2001. Continued weakness in the fertilizer market is expected to offset gains in the Southeast feed markets and new business. 33 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) AGRICULTURE, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND GOVERNMENT (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 603 $ 609 $ 539 Revenues decreased $6 million, or 1%, in 2001, principally due to soft farm demand, depressed fertilizer production and increased imports. This group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizers, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products and items for the military. INTERMODAL traffic volume decreased 1%, but revenues increased slightly in 2001. Domestic traffic volume was up in the first half of the year, but demand increasingly weakened as the year progressed, which eroded NS base of traffic. New business supported by the opening of three new terminals and other initiatives mitigated the effects of the weakened economy. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew slightly as U.S. imports slowed with the economy. TCS traffic volume increased 1% despite economic conditions, as it continued to benefit from reliable, trucklike service. Intermodal revenue per unit dropped later in the year, reflecting the expiration of fuel surcharges that were implemented late in 2000 and the introduction of new shorter haul business. In 2000, intermodal traffic volume increased 18%, and revenues increased 32%, primarily due to a full year of Northern Region traffic and the consolidation of TCS revenues (see Note 2 on Page 58). About half of the improvement in revenue per unit resulted from the effects of consolidating TCS. Prior to June 1, 1999, NS revenues included only the amounts for rail services it performed under contract to TCS, but NS volume included most TCS units. Also contributing to the revenue per unit improvement were rate increases throughout the year on domestic business and the implementation of fuel surcharges later in the year. In addition, increased demand, new business and improved service contributed to the gains, as major customers, including UPS, JB Hunt, Hub Group and Maersk, increased volumes. Despite weak demand in the first quarter and the loss in December 1999 of a major customer, NS had regained its market share by the second quarter. Domestic and premium business volumes benefited from service improvements and expansion initiatives. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew 5%, notwithstanding the loss of business from a major customer. TCS traffic increased 3%, as it recovered from service shortcomings after the Closing Date. Intermodal revenues are expected to benefit from continued improvements in service and the terminal capacity added in 2001. 34 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) INTERMODAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 1,123 $ 1,119 $ 849 Revenues increased $4 million in 2001, despite a 1% drop in traffic volume. This group handles trailers, domestic and international containers, TCS equipment and equipment for intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers and other shippers. Railway Operating Expenses Railway operating expenses decreased 7% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. Expenses in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force. Excluding these costs, railway operating expenses decreased 4% in 2001, while carloads dropped 3%; and increased 19% in 2000 on carloads that were 15% higher. The higher expense increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and sharply higher diesel fuel prices. The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, was 83.7% in 2001, compared with 87.0% in 2000 (excluding the work force reduction costs, which increased the ratio 2.7 percentage points) and 86.3% in 1999. The decline in the 2001 ratio reflected the increase in revenue per unit as well as reduced expenses that resulted from gains in efficiency. The increase in the 2000 ratio reflected the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the sharp increase in diesel fuel prices, which more than offset the absence of the significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues after the Closing Date. In addition, the ratio was adversely affected by a change in traffic mix (more resource intensive traffic, such as automotive and intermodal) and the new traffic in the Northern Region, coupled with the decrease in export coal traffic. 35 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications. RAILWAY OPERATING EXPENSES Increases (Decreases) ($ in millions) 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 Compensation and benefits * $ (220) $ 379 Materials, services and rents (1) 171 Conrail rents and services (57) 167 Depreciation 11 28 Diesel fuel (66) 223 Casualties and other claims 1 4 Other (31) 30 Total $ (363) $1,002 * Includes $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Compensation and benefits represented 39% of total railway operating expenses and decreased 10% in 2001, but increased 20% in 2000. Both comparisons reflect the $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Excluding those costs, compensation and benefits decreased 3% in 2001, but increased 12% in 2000. The 3% decline in 2001 reflected savings attributable to the reduced size of the work force. These savings were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees, higher incentive compensation and reduced pension income. The 12% increase in 2000 was largely attributable to the effects of a full year of expanded operations and higher wages and benefit costs for union employees. These increases were mitigated by higher pension income and the absence of the $49 million incurred in 1999 for the Special Work Incentive Program (SWIP) for union employees in the third quarter of 1999. Pension income was higher in 2000 largely due to the transfer of assets from the Conrail pension plan after the Closing Date. NS has substantial unrecognized gains related to its overfunded pension plan; amortization of these gains will continue to be included in "Compensation and benefits" expenses (see Note 11 on Page 68). The Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll taxes. The phase in calls for a reduction from 16.1% in 2001 to 15.6% in 2002, 14.2% in 2003 and 13.1% in 2004. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated. These changes are expected to result in a $21 million reduction to payroll tax expenses in 2002. The new law allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four year reserve or exceed a six year reserve. 36 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Materials, services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses decreased slightly in 2001, but increased 13% in 2000. In 2001, the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services, including expenses for software, consulting and legal fees. The increase in 2000 was mostly attributable to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the consolidation of TCS and was mitigated by the absence of significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 11% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases. The 2000 increase was principally due to the effects of a full year of expanded operations but was mitigated by a favorable comparison for the last seven months, as expenses in 1999 were high due to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Locomotive and equipment repair costs increased in 2001, principally due to renewed maintenance activity. This trend is expected to continue in 2002, driven by higher expenses for freight car repairs. In 2000, maintenance costs increased, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations; however, the increase was tempered by reduced maintenance activities, a result of cost control efforts. Conrail rents and services, a new category of expense beginning in 1999, arose from the expansion of operations on the Closing Date and amounted to $421 million in 2001, $478 million in 2000 and $311 million in 1999. This item includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRCs operation of the Shared Assets Areas. Also included is NS equity in Conrails net earnings since the Closing Date, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between NS investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2 on Page 58). The decline in 2001 reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see "Conrails Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity," below). Expenses in 2000 included a full year of operations over Conrails lines, compared with seven months in 1999. Depreciation expense was up 2% in 2001 and 6% in 2000. Increases in both years were due to property additions, reflecting substantial levels of capital spending (see Note 1, "Properties," on Page 57 for NS depreciation policy). A periodic review of depreciation rates is being finalized, and rates are expected to be somewhat lower. 37 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Diesel fuel expenses decreased 14% in 2001, but increased 87% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in 2001 include $8 million related to the hedging program initiated in the second quarter (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note 16 on Page 77). The increase in 2000 expenses resulted from a 61% rise in the average price per gallon and higher consumption that reflected a full year of Northern Region operations. Casualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased slightly in 2001 and 3% in 2000. The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2001, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 31% of the total employee injury cases settled and 15% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, promotes an adversarial claims environment and produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent. The railroads have been unsuccessful so far in efforts to persuade Congress to replace FELA with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2001, but increased 14% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to lower bad debt costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee relocation expenses. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and higher bad debt expense. Other Income Net Other income net was $99 million in 2001, $168 million in 2000 and $115 million in 1999 (see Note 3 on Page 61). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of certain timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests. This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December. The increase in 2000 reflected the $101 million of gains, mitigated by the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). 38 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2001 was $191 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 31% in 2000 and 32% in 1999. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2001 and 34% in both 2000 and 1999. The effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, both 2000 and 1999 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in 1981. In January 2001, NS received payment from the third party in accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $654 million in 2001, compared with $1.3 billion in 2000 and $533 million in 1999. Results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). Excluding the infusion of cash from this program, operating cash flow declined $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." In 2001, NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $250 million. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital, including an improvement in collection of accounts receivable, a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of bonus payments. The large changes in "Accounts receivable" and "Current liabilities other than debt" in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from the commencement of operations in the Northern Region. In addition, collection of accounts receivable had slowed. NS working capital deficit was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2000. The increase resulted principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. Part of the working capital deficit at Dec. 31, 2001, arises from a $373 million balance in "Notes and accounts payable to Conrail" that is not expected to be repaid in 2002. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part II, Item 7, "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on Page 44 under the heading "Market Risks and Hedging Activities." 49 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Revenue per unit increased in all market groups, principally due to rate increases, use of higher capacity equipment and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, revenues increased for all market groups, reflecting a full year of handling Northern Region traffic. Revenues improved for the last seven months, a comparison that fully includes the Northern Region in both years, reflecting recovery of most of the diverted traffic and new business. However, weakness in the economy resulted in lower revenues very late in the year. Revenue per unit improved in most market groups, principally due to the effects of Northern Region traffic and increased rates. About half of the revenue per unit increase for the intermodal market group was attributable to the effects of the consolidation of Triple Crown Services Company (TCS) revenues (see discussion of intermodal revenues below). COAL tonnage increased 2% in 2001 and revenues increased 6%. Revenue per unit increased 6%, a result of rate increases, including lower volume related refunds on export coal shipments, gains in tonnage per car and favorable changes to the mix of traffic (less shorter haul business). Coal, coke and iron ore revenues represented 25% of total railway operating revenues in 2001, and 83% of NS coal shipments originated on lines it operated. In 2000, coal tonnage increased 11%, and revenues increased 9%, reflecting a full year of Northern Region traffic. Revenue per unit declined, a result of a higher proportion of traffic with a shorter length of haul, principally attributable to a full year of Northern Region operations. TOTAL COAL, COKE AND IRON ORE TONNAGE (In millions of tons) 2001 2000 1999 Utility 133 119 108 Export 14 20 18 Domestic metallurgical 20 25 22 Other 11 11 10 Total 178 175 158 Utility coal traffic increased 11% in 2001, reflecting higher demand for coal fired electricity and the effects of very high natural gas prices early in the year. High demand for electricity, a volatile market for natural gas and production problems at a number of large mines in the East late in 2000 combined to increase the demand for coal early in 2001 with a resulting increase in coal prices. Utility coal traffic volume also benefited from the shifting of coal that traditionally would have been bound for export to the domestic market. In 2000, utility coal traffic increased 11%, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations. The effects of expanded operations were somewhat offset by coal production problems at several NS served mines, unanticipated outages at some NS served utility plants, large stockpiles at the beginning of the year and mild summer weather in portions of NS service territory. The near term outlook for utility coal remains positive. U.S. demand for electricity continues to grow rapidly, and coal fired generation remains the cheapest marginal source of electricity. Several underutilized coal fired power plants are making the transition 28 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) from peak only generation to full time generation. In addition, although natural gas prices have returned to more normal levels, the volatility of natural gas prices may improve the long term competitive position of coal fired generation. Phase II of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which imposes more stringent limits on sulfur dioxide emissions, took effect on Jan. 1, 2000. Many of the mines served by NS produce coals that satisfy Phase II requirements. In addition, substantial banks of sulfur dioxide allowances held by many NS served utilities should continue to provide a market for other NS served mines for many years. However, several federal environmental regulatory initiatives continued to be pursued during 2001, including "new source review" for older coal fired plants. Many of the rules that have been promulgated to date are in litigation. If the rules survive litigation and are implemented, they could increase the cost of coal fired generation and potentially adversely affect the value of the sulfur dioxide allowance bank. The Bush Administration rejected in 2001 the Kyoto Protocol and withdrew U.S. participation in that process. If implemented, the proposed Kyoto limits on greenhouse gases could have put additional cost pressures on coal fired generation. The U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto process has renewed interest in building coal fired generation plants. The 1999 decision by a federal district court judge in West Virginia holding that some common mountaintop mining practices in the coal industry are illegal was overturned in April 2001 by the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In January 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the case. Export coal tonnage declined 30% in 2001. The rapid rise of domestic utility coal prices early in the year enticed many foreign market suppliers to place much of their 2001 production in the domestic utility markets. In addition, production difficulties at several large NS served mines and flooding in West Virginia in July significantly reduced the supply of low volatile coal. The combination of these factors resulted in most of the decline in shipments of export coal. Steam coal exported through Baltimore declined 32%, and export metallurgical coals through Norfolk declined by 30%. Demand for steam coal to export strengthened in the last half of 2001; however, the strong U.S. demand limited NS participation in this market. Demand for coking coal to export continued to soften, as steel production moved from traditional NS markets in Europe to Asia, which in recent years has been supplied by Australian or Canadian coals. In 2000, export coal tonnage increased 8%, a result of a full year of access to Baltimore through the Northern Region, mitigated by lower tonnage through Norfolk. Several additional factors also adversely affected export coal traffic volume. Delayed settlements between buyers and sellers in the spring postponed shipments of some export tonnage. Foreign buyers ultimately intended to purchase additional U.S. metallurgical coal, but production capacity available for export had been diminished by two years of dramatically lower prices. Toward the end of 2000, production difficulties at several large NS served mines significantly reduced tonnage available for export. Limited supplies overall prevented other coal producers from providing substitute coal. Export coal tonnage is expected to continue to be limited by supply and subject to the fluctuations of the world market. While the consolidation of Australian producers should help stabilize that supply channel, new Australian production could displace U.S. 29 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) volumes to Europe absent any increase in demand. Moreover, Chinese participation in Pacific Rim markets could displace Australian coals there and force that tonnage to Europe. Domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic decreased 18% in 2001, due to a decline in the market for domestic steel. The softening economy and an increase in steel imports drastically cut blast furnace production, sharply reducing the demand for coking coal, iron ore and coke. The increase in imported steel also resulted in lower prices that put pressure on the U.S. steel industry and led to plant closures and bankruptcies that included some NS customers. In 2000, domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic increased 17%, due to a full year of Northern Region operations. In addition, increased production in the first half of the year and gains in NS market share contributed to the higher traffic. However, the softening economy and increased steel imports diminished blast furnace production rates, sharply reducing demand for raw materials. Domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic is expected to continue to suffer from the decline in demand for domestically produced steel. However, the United States has applied a tariff on imported coke, which has reduced its entry to the U.S. market. Moreover, the U.S. International Trade Commission has recommended that President Bush take similar action on imported steel. But long term demand is expected to continue to decline, due to advanced technologies that allow production of steel using less coke. Other coal traffic, principally steam coal shipped to manufacturing plants, increased 6% in 2001 and 4% in 2000. The gain in 2001 resulted from new and increased business from industrial customers. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of handling Northern Region traffic; however, this was mitigated by the loss of some traffic to competitors. COAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $1,521 $1,435 $1,322 Revenues increased $86 million, or 6%, in 2001, primarily due to increased utility coal traffic volume and higher revenue per unit. This group includes utility coal, export coal, domestic metallurgical coal and industrial coal, coke and iron ore. GENERAL MERCHANDISE traffic volume (carloads) decreased 7% in 2001, and revenues decreased 2%, principally due to the effects of the weak economy. In 2000, traffic volume increased 15%, and revenues increased 17%, reflecting a full year of operating the Northern Region. 30 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Automotive traffic volume decreased 10%, and revenues declined 4% in 2001, principally due to a 10% drop in vehicle production. Revenue per unit increased 7%, principally due to rate increases, efficiencies gained from the redesign of the mixing center network and use of higher capacity equipment. In 2000, automotive traffic volume increased 13%, and revenues increased 23%, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations, record vehicle production and the recapture of business diverted because of service issues after the Closing Date. The carload increase was less than the revenue increase principally due to the effects of a redesign of the mixing center network. This redesign improves vehicle velocity through the network and includes changes in traffic flows that resulted in a decline in carloads, with no corresponding decrease in revenues. Ford Motor Company, NS largest customer, has announced potential reductions in vehicle production which could affect NS volumes. However, automotive revenues in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those of 2001, as light vehicle production is predicted to be flat. AUTOMOTIVE (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 885 $ 921 $ 746 Revenues decreased $36 million, or 4%, in 2001, due to a 10% drop in traffic volume. Revenue per unit increased, principally due to rate increases and improved efficiency. This group includes finished vehicles for BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Isuzu, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saab, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Mercedes Benz and Toyota. Chemicals traffic volume decreased 5%, and revenues decreased 1% in 2001. The weak economy depressed shipments of petroleum, plastics, industrial and miscellaneous chemicals. These declines were partially offset by new business through NS Thoroughbred Bulk Transfer (TBT) facilities that handle chemicals and bulk commodities for customers not located on NS served lines. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and a favorable change in the mix of traffic (more longer haul moves). In 2000, chemicals traffic volume increased 15%, and revenues increased 18%, due to a full year of Northern Region operations and the return of traffic that had been diverted because of service issues after the Closing Date. Shipments of miscellaneous chemicals, chlorine, caustic soda and plastics continued to rebound, but sulfur carloads were down due to weak fertilizer markets. Chemicals shipments continued to increase through NS TBT facilities. Chemicals revenues are expected to continue to be adversely affected until the economy recovers. However, NS expects to benefit from new business and improved yields. 31 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) CHEMICALS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 752 $ 756 $ 641 Revenues decreased $4 million, or 1%, in 2001, due to lower traffic volumes that resulted from the weak economy. This group includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes and municipal wastes. Metals and construction traffic volume decreased 7%, and revenues declined 2% in 2001, reflecting weakness in the steel and construction industries. The steel industry recession, which began in 2000, has resulted in excess capacity and the closing of numerous steel mills. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, metals and construction traffic volume increased 29%, and revenues increased 22%, reflecting a full year of operations over the expanded system. Revenue per unit declined, largely due to a change in the mix of traffic. Metals traffic benefited from increased shipments of sheet steel, imported slab steel and ferrous scrap; however, this was tempered by a significant slowdown in the steel industry in the last half of the year. Construction traffic benefited from continued strength in housing starts and highway construction. Metals and construction revenues are expected to suffer from the effects of a continued softness in the steel market. However, increased highway construction in NS service area is expected to mitigate the drop in metals demand. METALS AND CONSTRUCTION (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 674 $ 689 $ 567 Revenues decreased $15 million, or 2%, in 2001, principally due to weakness in the steel industry. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. This group includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks and minerals. Paper, clay and forest products traffic volume declined 8%, and revenues decreased 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Paper shipments were adversely affected by reduced production at many NS served paper mills, a result of sluggish newspaper advertising and soft demand for paper. Lumber traffic began the year weak, 32 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) improved in late summer, but softened late in the year due to short term weakness in housing starts. Revenue per unit increased principally due to higher rates. In 2000, paper, clay and forest products traffic volume increased 5%, and revenues increased 9%, principally due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations. Consolidation in the paper industry and a weakening paper market in the second half of the year contributed to lower carloads during the summer months and into the fall. Weak demand for paper production inputs, such as scrap paper and wood pulp, was tempered by stronger demand for newsprint and printing paper. Paper, clay and forest products revenues are expected to continue to be adversely affected by weak demand in 2002, due to continued consolidations and little anticipated capacity expansion through 2003. NS is pursuing new business using MODALGISTICS(SM), its supply chain focused business unit formed in February 2001. PAPER, CLAY AND FOREST PRODUCTS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 612 $ 630 $ 578 Revenues decreased $18 million, or 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Revenue per unit benefited from higher rates. This group includes lumber and wood products, pulpboard and paper products, woodfibers, woodpulp, scrap paper and clay. NS serves 66 paper mills, 105 paper distribution centers and more than 100 lumber reload centers. Agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume decreased 3%, and revenues declined 1% in 2001, primarily due to reduced shipments of fertilizer. This decline was due to soft farm demand, record high natural gas prices early in the year (which curtailed production of certain fertilizers) and increased imports. This was mitigated by traffic volume increases for grain, flour, wheat and canned goods. The revenue per unit increase was primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume increased 7%, and revenues increased 13%, due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region traffic and modest growth in the Southeast markets. Rate increases and more longer haul (higher revenue per unit) traffic also contributed to the revenue increase. Grain traffic benefited from new shuttle train service that improved service to new and expanded Southeast feed mills. In addition, traffic increased for Midwest grain and sweeteners and consumer goods from the West. Agriculture, consumer products and government revenues in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those of 2001. Continued weakness in the fertilizer market is expected to offset gains in the Southeast feed markets and new business. 33 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) AGRICULTURE, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND GOVERNMENT (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 603 $ 609 $ 539 Revenues decreased $6 million, or 1%, in 2001, principally due to soft farm demand, depressed fertilizer production and increased imports. This group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizers, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products and items for the military. INTERMODAL traffic volume decreased 1%, but revenues increased slightly in 2001. Domestic traffic volume was up in the first half of the year, but demand increasingly weakened as the year progressed, which eroded NS base of traffic. New business supported by the opening of three new terminals and other initiatives mitigated the effects of the weakened economy. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew slightly as U.S. imports slowed with the economy. TCS traffic volume increased 1% despite economic conditions, as it continued to benefit from reliable, trucklike service. Intermodal revenue per unit dropped later in the year, reflecting the expiration of fuel surcharges that were implemented late in 2000 and the introduction of new shorter haul business. In 2000, intermodal traffic volume increased 18%, and revenues increased 32%, primarily due to a full year of Northern Region traffic and the consolidation of TCS revenues (see Note 2 on Page 58). About half of the improvement in revenue per unit resulted from the effects of consolidating TCS. Prior to June 1, 1999, NS revenues included only the amounts for rail services it performed under contract to TCS, but NS volume included most TCS units. Also contributing to the revenue per unit improvement were rate increases throughout the year on domestic business and the implementation of fuel surcharges later in the year. In addition, increased demand, new business and improved service contributed to the gains, as major customers, including UPS, JB Hunt, Hub Group and Maersk, increased volumes. Despite weak demand in the first quarter and the loss in December 1999 of a major customer, NS had regained its market share by the second quarter. Domestic and premium business volumes benefited from service improvements and expansion initiatives. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew 5%, notwithstanding the loss of business from a major customer. TCS traffic increased 3%, as it recovered from service shortcomings after the Closing Date. Intermodal revenues are expected to benefit from continued improvements in service and the terminal capacity added in 2001. 34 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) INTERMODAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 1,123 $ 1,119 $ 849 Revenues increased $4 million in 2001, despite a 1% drop in traffic volume. This group handles trailers, domestic and international containers, TCS equipment and equipment for intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers and other shippers. Railway Operating Expenses Railway operating expenses decreased 7% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. Expenses in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force. Excluding these costs, railway operating expenses decreased 4% in 2001, while carloads dropped 3%; and increased 19% in 2000 on carloads that were 15% higher. The higher expense increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and sharply higher diesel fuel prices. The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, was 83.7% in 2001, compared with 87.0% in 2000 (excluding the work force reduction costs, which increased the ratio 2.7 percentage points) and 86.3% in 1999. The decline in the 2001 ratio reflected the increase in revenue per unit as well as reduced expenses that resulted from gains in efficiency. The increase in the 2000 ratio reflected the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the sharp increase in diesel fuel prices, which more than offset the absence of the significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues after the Closing Date. In addition, the ratio was adversely affected by a change in traffic mix (more resource intensive traffic, such as automotive and intermodal) and the new traffic in the Northern Region, coupled with the decrease in export coal traffic. 35 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications. RAILWAY OPERATING EXPENSES Increases (Decreases) ($ in millions) 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 Compensation and benefits * $ (220) $ 379 Materials, services and rents (1) 171 Conrail rents and services (57) 167 Depreciation 11 28 Diesel fuel (66) 223 Casualties and other claims 1 4 Other (31) 30 Total $ (363) $1,002 * Includes $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Compensation and benefits represented 39% of total railway operating expenses and decreased 10% in 2001, but increased 20% in 2000. Both comparisons reflect the $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Excluding those costs, compensation and benefits decreased 3% in 2001, but increased 12% in 2000. The 3% decline in 2001 reflected savings attributable to the reduced size of the work force. These savings were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees, higher incentive compensation and reduced pension income. The 12% increase in 2000 was largely attributable to the effects of a full year of expanded operations and higher wages and benefit costs for union employees. These increases were mitigated by higher pension income and the absence of the $49 million incurred in 1999 for the Special Work Incentive Program (SWIP) for union employees in the third quarter of 1999. Pension income was higher in 2000 largely due to the transfer of assets from the Conrail pension plan after the Closing Date. NS has substantial unrecognized gains related to its overfunded pension plan; amortization of these gains will continue to be included in "Compensation and benefits" expenses (see Note 11 on Page 68). The Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll taxes. The phase in calls for a reduction from 16.1% in 2001 to 15.6% in 2002, 14.2% in 2003 and 13.1% in 2004. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated. These changes are expected to result in a $21 million reduction to payroll tax expenses in 2002. The new law allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four year reserve or exceed a six year reserve. 36 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Materials, services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses decreased slightly in 2001, but increased 13% in 2000. In 2001, the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services, including expenses for software, consulting and legal fees. The increase in 2000 was mostly attributable to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the consolidation of TCS and was mitigated by the absence of significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 11% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases. The 2000 increase was principally due to the effects of a full year of expanded operations but was mitigated by a favorable comparison for the last seven months, as expenses in 1999 were high due to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Locomotive and equipment repair costs increased in 2001, principally due to renewed maintenance activity. This trend is expected to continue in 2002, driven by higher expenses for freight car repairs. In 2000, maintenance costs increased, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations; however, the increase was tempered by reduced maintenance activities, a result of cost control efforts. Conrail rents and services, a new category of expense beginning in 1999, arose from the expansion of operations on the Closing Date and amounted to $421 million in 2001, $478 million in 2000 and $311 million in 1999. This item includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRCs operation of the Shared Assets Areas. Also included is NS equity in Conrails net earnings since the Closing Date, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between NS investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2 on Page 58). The decline in 2001 reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see "Conrails Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity," below). Expenses in 2000 included a full year of operations over Conrails lines, compared with seven months in 1999. Depreciation expense was up 2% in 2001 and 6% in 2000. Increases in both years were due to property additions, reflecting substantial levels of capital spending (see Note 1, "Properties," on Page 57 for NS depreciation policy). A periodic review of depreciation rates is being finalized, and rates are expected to be somewhat lower. 37 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Diesel fuel expenses decreased 14% in 2001, but increased 87% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in 2001 include $8 million related to the hedging program initiated in the second quarter (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note 16 on Page 77). The increase in 2000 expenses resulted from a 61% rise in the average price per gallon and higher consumption that reflected a full year of Northern Region operations. Casualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased slightly in 2001 and 3% in 2000. The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2001, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 31% of the total employee injury cases settled and 15% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, promotes an adversarial claims environment and produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent. The railroads have been unsuccessful so far in efforts to persuade Congress to replace FELA with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2001, but increased 14% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to lower bad debt costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee relocation expenses. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and higher bad debt expense. Other Income Net Other income net was $99 million in 2001, $168 million in 2000 and $115 million in 1999 (see Note 3 on Page 61). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of certain timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests. This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December. The increase in 2000 reflected the $101 million of gains, mitigated by the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). 38 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2001 was $191 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 31% in 2000 and 32% in 1999. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2001 and 34% in both 2000 and 1999. The effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, both 2000 and 1999 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in 1981. In January 2001, NS received payment from the third party in accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $654 million in 2001, compared with $1.3 billion in 2000 and $533 million in 1999. Results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). Excluding the infusion of cash from this program, operating cash flow declined $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." In 2001, NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $250 million. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital, including an improvement in collection of accounts receivable, a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of bonus payments. The large changes in "Accounts receivable" and "Current liabilities other than debt" in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from the commencement of operations in the Northern Region. In addition, collection of accounts receivable had slowed. NS working capital deficit was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2000. The increase resulted principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. Part of the working capital deficit at Dec. 31, 2001, arises from a $373 million balance in "Notes and accounts payable to Conrail" that is not expected to be repaid in 2002. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7.

The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part II, Item 7, "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on Page 44 under the heading "Market Risks and Hedging Activities." 49 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) from peak only generation to full time generation. In addition, although natural gas prices have returned to more normal levels, the volatility of natural gas prices may improve the long term competitive position of coal fired generation. Phase II of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which imposes more stringent limits on sulfur dioxide emissions, took effect on Jan. 1, 2000. Many of the mines served by NS produce coals that satisfy Phase II requirements. In addition, substantial banks of sulfur dioxide allowances held by many NS served utilities should continue to provide a market for other NS served mines for many years. However, several federal environmental regulatory initiatives continued to be pursued during 2001, including "new source review" for older coal fired plants. Many of the rules that have been promulgated to date are in litigation. If the rules survive litigation and are implemented, they could increase the cost of coal fired generation and potentially adversely affect the value of the sulfur dioxide allowance bank. The Bush Administration rejected in 2001 the Kyoto Protocol and withdrew U.S. participation in that process. If implemented, the proposed Kyoto limits on greenhouse gases could have put additional cost pressures on coal fired generation. The U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto process has renewed interest in building coal fired generation plants. The 1999 decision by a federal district court judge in West Virginia holding that some common mountaintop mining practices in the coal industry are illegal was overturned in April 2001 by the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In January 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the case. Export coal tonnage declined 30% in 2001. The rapid rise of domestic utility coal prices early in the year enticed many foreign market suppliers to place much of their 2001 production in the domestic utility markets. In addition, production difficulties at several large NS served mines and flooding in West Virginia in July significantly reduced the supply of low volatile coal. The combination of these factors resulted in most of the decline in shipments of export coal. Steam coal exported through Baltimore declined 32%, and export metallurgical coals through Norfolk declined by 30%. Demand for steam coal to export strengthened in the last half of 2001; however, the strong U.S. demand limited NS participation in this market. Demand for coking coal to export continued to soften, as steel production moved from traditional NS markets in Europe to Asia, which in recent years has been supplied by Australian or Canadian coals. In 2000, export coal tonnage increased 8%, a result of a full year of access to Baltimore through the Northern Region, mitigated by lower tonnage through Norfolk. Several additional factors also adversely affected export coal traffic volume. Delayed settlements between buyers and sellers in the spring postponed shipments of some export tonnage. Foreign buyers ultimately intended to purchase additional U.S. metallurgical coal, but production capacity available for export had been diminished by two years of dramatically lower prices. Toward the end of 2000, production difficulties at several large NS served mines significantly reduced tonnage available for export. Limited supplies overall prevented other coal producers from providing substitute coal. Export coal tonnage is expected to continue to be limited by supply and subject to the fluctuations of the world market. While the consolidation of Australian producers should help stabilize that supply channel, new Australian production could displace U.S. 29 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) volumes to Europe absent any increase in demand. Moreover, Chinese participation in Pacific Rim markets could displace Australian coals there and force that tonnage to Europe. Domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic decreased 18% in 2001, due to a decline in the market for domestic steel. The softening economy and an increase in steel imports drastically cut blast furnace production, sharply reducing the demand for coking coal, iron ore and coke. The increase in imported steel also resulted in lower prices that put pressure on the U.S. steel industry and led to plant closures and bankruptcies that included some NS customers. In 2000, domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic increased 17%, due to a full year of Northern Region operations. In addition, increased production in the first half of the year and gains in NS market share contributed to the higher traffic. However, the softening economy and increased steel imports diminished blast furnace production rates, sharply reducing demand for raw materials. Domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic is expected to continue to suffer from the decline in demand for domestically produced steel. However, the United States has applied a tariff on imported coke, which has reduced its entry to the U.S. market. Moreover, the U.S. International Trade Commission has recommended that President Bush take similar action on imported steel. But long term demand is expected to continue to decline, due to advanced technologies that allow production of steel using less coke. Other coal traffic, principally steam coal shipped to manufacturing plants, increased 6% in 2001 and 4% in 2000. The gain in 2001 resulted from new and increased business from industrial customers. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of handling Northern Region traffic; however, this was mitigated by the loss of some traffic to competitors. COAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $1,521 $1,435 $1,322 Revenues increased $86 million, or 6%, in 2001, primarily due to increased utility coal traffic volume and higher revenue per unit. This group includes utility coal, export coal, domestic metallurgical coal and industrial coal, coke and iron ore. GENERAL MERCHANDISE traffic volume (carloads) decreased 7% in 2001, and revenues decreased 2%, principally due to the effects of the weak economy. In 2000, traffic volume increased 15%, and revenues increased 17%, reflecting a full year of operating the Northern Region. 30 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Automotive traffic volume decreased 10%, and revenues declined 4% in 2001, principally due to a 10% drop in vehicle production. Revenue per unit increased 7%, principally due to rate increases, efficiencies gained from the redesign of the mixing center network and use of higher capacity equipment. In 2000, automotive traffic volume increased 13%, and revenues increased 23%, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations, record vehicle production and the recapture of business diverted because of service issues after the Closing Date. The carload increase was less than the revenue increase principally due to the effects of a redesign of the mixing center network. This redesign improves vehicle velocity through the network and includes changes in traffic flows that resulted in a decline in carloads, with no corresponding decrease in revenues. Ford Motor Company, NS largest customer, has announced potential reductions in vehicle production which could affect NS volumes. However, automotive revenues in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those of 2001, as light vehicle production is predicted to be flat. AUTOMOTIVE (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 885 $ 921 $ 746 Revenues decreased $36 million, or 4%, in 2001, due to a 10% drop in traffic volume. Revenue per unit increased, principally due to rate increases and improved efficiency. This group includes finished vehicles for BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Isuzu, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saab, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Mercedes Benz and Toyota. Chemicals traffic volume decreased 5%, and revenues decreased 1% in 2001. The weak economy depressed shipments of petroleum, plastics, industrial and miscellaneous chemicals. These declines were partially offset by new business through NS Thoroughbred Bulk Transfer (TBT) facilities that handle chemicals and bulk commodities for customers not located on NS served lines. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and a favorable change in the mix of traffic (more longer haul moves). In 2000, chemicals traffic volume increased 15%, and revenues increased 18%, due to a full year of Northern Region operations and the return of traffic that had been diverted because of service issues after the Closing Date. Shipments of miscellaneous chemicals, chlorine, caustic soda and plastics continued to rebound, but sulfur carloads were down due to weak fertilizer markets. Chemicals shipments continued to increase through NS TBT facilities. Chemicals revenues are expected to continue to be adversely affected until the economy recovers. However, NS expects to benefit from new business and improved yields. 31 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) CHEMICALS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 752 $ 756 $ 641 Revenues decreased $4 million, or 1%, in 2001, due to lower traffic volumes that resulted from the weak economy. This group includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes and municipal wastes. Metals and construction traffic volume decreased 7%, and revenues declined 2% in 2001, reflecting weakness in the steel and construction industries. The steel industry recession, which began in 2000, has resulted in excess capacity and the closing of numerous steel mills. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, metals and construction traffic volume increased 29%, and revenues increased 22%, reflecting a full year of operations over the expanded system. Revenue per unit declined, largely due to a change in the mix of traffic. Metals traffic benefited from increased shipments of sheet steel, imported slab steel and ferrous scrap; however, this was tempered by a significant slowdown in the steel industry in the last half of the year. Construction traffic benefited from continued strength in housing starts and highway construction. Metals and construction revenues are expected to suffer from the effects of a continued softness in the steel market. However, increased highway construction in NS service area is expected to mitigate the drop in metals demand. METALS AND CONSTRUCTION (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 674 $ 689 $ 567 Revenues decreased $15 million, or 2%, in 2001, principally due to weakness in the steel industry. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. This group includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks and minerals. Paper, clay and forest products traffic volume declined 8%, and revenues decreased 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Paper shipments were adversely affected by reduced production at many NS served paper mills, a result of sluggish newspaper advertising and soft demand for paper. Lumber traffic began the year weak, 32 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) improved in late summer, but softened late in the year due to short term weakness in housing starts. Revenue per unit increased principally due to higher rates. In 2000, paper, clay and forest products traffic volume increased 5%, and revenues increased 9%, principally due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations. Consolidation in the paper industry and a weakening paper market in the second half of the year contributed to lower carloads during the summer months and into the fall. Weak demand for paper production inputs, such as scrap paper and wood pulp, was tempered by stronger demand for newsprint and printing paper. Paper, clay and forest products revenues are expected to continue to be adversely affected by weak demand in 2002, due to continued consolidations and little anticipated capacity expansion through 2003. NS is pursuing new business using MODALGISTICS(SM), its supply chain focused business unit formed in February 2001. PAPER, CLAY AND FOREST PRODUCTS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 612 $ 630 $ 578 Revenues decreased $18 million, or 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Revenue per unit benefited from higher rates. This group includes lumber and wood products, pulpboard and paper products, woodfibers, woodpulp, scrap paper and clay. NS serves 66 paper mills, 105 paper distribution centers and more than 100 lumber reload centers. Agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume decreased 3%, and revenues declined 1% in 2001, primarily due to reduced shipments of fertilizer. This decline was due to soft farm demand, record high natural gas prices early in the year (which curtailed production of certain fertilizers) and increased imports. This was mitigated by traffic volume increases for grain, flour, wheat and canned goods. The revenue per unit increase was primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume increased 7%, and revenues increased 13%, due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region traffic and modest growth in the Southeast markets. Rate increases and more longer haul (higher revenue per unit) traffic also contributed to the revenue increase. Grain traffic benefited from new shuttle train service that improved service to new and expanded Southeast feed mills. In addition, traffic increased for Midwest grain and sweeteners and consumer goods from the West. Agriculture, consumer products and government revenues in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those of 2001. Continued weakness in the fertilizer market is expected to offset gains in the Southeast feed markets and new business. 33 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) AGRICULTURE, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND GOVERNMENT (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 603 $ 609 $ 539 Revenues decreased $6 million, or 1%, in 2001, principally due to soft farm demand, depressed fertilizer production and increased imports. This group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizers, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products and items for the military. INTERMODAL traffic volume decreased 1%, but revenues increased slightly in 2001. Domestic traffic volume was up in the first half of the year, but demand increasingly weakened as the year progressed, which eroded NS base of traffic. New business supported by the opening of three new terminals and other initiatives mitigated the effects of the weakened economy. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew slightly as U.S. imports slowed with the economy. TCS traffic volume increased 1% despite economic conditions, as it continued to benefit from reliable, trucklike service. Intermodal revenue per unit dropped later in the year, reflecting the expiration of fuel surcharges that were implemented late in 2000 and the introduction of new shorter haul business. In 2000, intermodal traffic volume increased 18%, and revenues increased 32%, primarily due to a full year of Northern Region traffic and the consolidation of TCS revenues (see Note 2 on Page 58). About half of the improvement in revenue per unit resulted from the effects of consolidating TCS. Prior to June 1, 1999, NS revenues included only the amounts for rail services it performed under contract to TCS, but NS volume included most TCS units. Also contributing to the revenue per unit improvement were rate increases throughout the year on domestic business and the implementation of fuel surcharges later in the year. In addition, increased demand, new business and improved service contributed to the gains, as major customers, including UPS, JB Hunt, Hub Group and Maersk, increased volumes. Despite weak demand in the first quarter and the loss in December 1999 of a major customer, NS had regained its market share by the second quarter. Domestic and premium business volumes benefited from service improvements and expansion initiatives. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew 5%, notwithstanding the loss of business from a major customer. TCS traffic increased 3%, as it recovered from service shortcomings after the Closing Date. Intermodal revenues are expected to benefit from continued improvements in service and the terminal capacity added in 2001. 34 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) INTERMODAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 1,123 $ 1,119 $ 849 Revenues increased $4 million in 2001, despite a 1% drop in traffic volume. This group handles trailers, domestic and international containers, TCS equipment and equipment for intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers and other shippers. Railway Operating Expenses Railway operating expenses decreased 7% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. Expenses in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force. Excluding these costs, railway operating expenses decreased 4% in 2001, while carloads dropped 3%; and increased 19% in 2000 on carloads that were 15% higher. The higher expense increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and sharply higher diesel fuel prices. The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, was 83.7% in 2001, compared with 87.0% in 2000 (excluding the work force reduction costs, which increased the ratio 2.7 percentage points) and 86.3% in 1999. The decline in the 2001 ratio reflected the increase in revenue per unit as well as reduced expenses that resulted from gains in efficiency. The increase in the 2000 ratio reflected the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the sharp increase in diesel fuel prices, which more than offset the absence of the significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues after the Closing Date. In addition, the ratio was adversely affected by a change in traffic mix (more resource intensive traffic, such as automotive and intermodal) and the new traffic in the Northern Region, coupled with the decrease in export coal traffic. 35 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications. RAILWAY OPERATING EXPENSES Increases (Decreases) ($ in millions) 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 Compensation and benefits * $ (220) $ 379 Materials, services and rents (1) 171 Conrail rents and services (57) 167 Depreciation 11 28 Diesel fuel (66) 223 Casualties and other claims 1 4 Other (31) 30 Total $ (363) $1,002 * Includes $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Compensation and benefits represented 39% of total railway operating expenses and decreased 10% in 2001, but increased 20% in 2000. Both comparisons reflect the $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Excluding those costs, compensation and benefits decreased 3% in 2001, but increased 12% in 2000. The 3% decline in 2001 reflected savings attributable to the reduced size of the work force. These savings were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees, higher incentive compensation and reduced pension income. The 12% increase in 2000 was largely attributable to the effects of a full year of expanded operations and higher wages and benefit costs for union employees. These increases were mitigated by higher pension income and the absence of the $49 million incurred in 1999 for the Special Work Incentive Program (SWIP) for union employees in the third quarter of 1999. Pension income was higher in 2000 largely due to the transfer of assets from the Conrail pension plan after the Closing Date. NS has substantial unrecognized gains related to its overfunded pension plan; amortization of these gains will continue to be included in "Compensation and benefits" expenses (see Note 11 on Page 68). The Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll taxes. The phase in calls for a reduction from 16.1% in 2001 to 15.6% in 2002, 14.2% in 2003 and 13.1% in 2004. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated. These changes are expected to result in a $21 million reduction to payroll tax expenses in 2002. The new law allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four year reserve or exceed a six year reserve. 36 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Materials, services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses decreased slightly in 2001, but increased 13% in 2000. In 2001, the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services, including expenses for software, consulting and legal fees. The increase in 2000 was mostly attributable to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the consolidation of TCS and was mitigated by the absence of significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 11% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases. The 2000 increase was principally due to the effects of a full year of expanded operations but was mitigated by a favorable comparison for the last seven months, as expenses in 1999 were high due to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Locomotive and equipment repair costs increased in 2001, principally due to renewed maintenance activity. This trend is expected to continue in 2002, driven by higher expenses for freight car repairs. In 2000, maintenance costs increased, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations; however, the increase was tempered by reduced maintenance activities, a result of cost control efforts. Conrail rents and services, a new category of expense beginning in 1999, arose from the expansion of operations on the Closing Date and amounted to $421 million in 2001, $478 million in 2000 and $311 million in 1999. This item includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRCs operation of the Shared Assets Areas. Also included is NS equity in Conrails net earnings since the Closing Date, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between NS investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2 on Page 58). The decline in 2001 reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see "Conrails Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity," below). Expenses in 2000 included a full year of operations over Conrails lines, compared with seven months in 1999. Depreciation expense was up 2% in 2001 and 6% in 2000. Increases in both years were due to property additions, reflecting substantial levels of capital spending (see Note 1, "Properties," on Page 57 for NS depreciation policy). A periodic review of depreciation rates is being finalized, and rates are expected to be somewhat lower. 37 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Diesel fuel expenses decreased 14% in 2001, but increased 87% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in 2001 include $8 million related to the hedging program initiated in the second quarter (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note 16 on Page 77). The increase in 2000 expenses resulted from a 61% rise in the average price per gallon and higher consumption that reflected a full year of Northern Region operations. Casualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased slightly in 2001 and 3% in 2000. The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2001, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 31% of the total employee injury cases settled and 15% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, promotes an adversarial claims environment and produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent. The railroads have been unsuccessful so far in efforts to persuade Congress to replace FELA with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2001, but increased 14% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to lower bad debt costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee relocation expenses. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and higher bad debt expense. Other Income Net Other income net was $99 million in 2001, $168 million in 2000 and $115 million in 1999 (see Note 3 on Page 61). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of certain timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests. This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December. The increase in 2000 reflected the $101 million of gains, mitigated by the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). 38 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2001 was $191 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 31% in 2000 and 32% in 1999. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2001 and 34% in both 2000 and 1999. The effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, both 2000 and 1999 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in 1981. In January 2001, NS received payment from the third party in accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $654 million in 2001, compared with $1.3 billion in 2000 and $533 million in 1999. Results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). Excluding the infusion of cash from this program, operating cash flow declined $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." In 2001, NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $250 million. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital, including an improvement in collection of accounts receivable, a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of bonus payments. The large changes in "Accounts receivable" and "Current liabilities other than debt" in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from the commencement of operations in the Northern Region. In addition, collection of accounts receivable had slowed. NS working capital deficit was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2000. The increase resulted principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. Part of the working capital deficit at Dec. 31, 2001, arises from a $373 million balance in "Notes and accounts payable to Conrail" that is not expected to be repaid in 2002. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part II, Item 7, "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on Page 44 under the heading "Market Risks and Hedging Activities." 49 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) volumes to Europe absent any increase in demand. Moreover, Chinese participation in Pacific Rim markets could displace Australian coals there and force that tonnage to Europe. Domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic decreased 18% in 2001, due to a decline in the market for domestic steel. The softening economy and an increase in steel imports drastically cut blast furnace production, sharply reducing the demand for coking coal, iron ore and coke. The increase in imported steel also resulted in lower prices that put pressure on the U.S. steel industry and led to plant closures and bankruptcies that included some NS customers. In 2000, domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic increased 17%, due to a full year of Northern Region operations. In addition, increased production in the first half of the year and gains in NS market share contributed to the higher traffic. However, the softening economy and increased steel imports diminished blast furnace production rates, sharply reducing demand for raw materials. Domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic is expected to continue to suffer from the decline in demand for domestically produced steel. However, the United States has applied a tariff on imported coke, which has reduced its entry to the U.S. market. Moreover, the U.S. International Trade Commission has recommended that President Bush take similar action on imported steel. But long term demand is expected to continue to decline, due to advanced technologies that allow production of steel using less coke. Other coal traffic, principally steam coal shipped to manufacturing plants, increased 6% in 2001 and 4% in 2000. The gain in 2001 resulted from new and increased business from industrial customers. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of handling Northern Region traffic; however, this was mitigated by the loss of some traffic to competitors. COAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $1,521 $1,435 $1,322 Revenues increased $86 million, or 6%, in 2001, primarily due to increased utility coal traffic volume and higher revenue per unit. This group includes utility coal, export coal, domestic metallurgical coal and industrial coal, coke and iron ore. GENERAL MERCHANDISE traffic volume (carloads) decreased 7% in 2001, and revenues decreased 2%, principally due to the effects of the weak economy. In 2000, traffic volume increased 15%, and revenues increased 17%, reflecting a full year of operating the Northern Region. 30 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Automotive traffic volume decreased 10%, and revenues declined 4% in 2001, principally due to a 10% drop in vehicle production. Revenue per unit increased 7%, principally due to rate increases, efficiencies gained from the redesign of the mixing center network and use of higher capacity equipment. In 2000, automotive traffic volume increased 13%, and revenues increased 23%, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations, record vehicle production and the recapture of business diverted because of service issues after the Closing Date. The carload increase was less than the revenue increase principally due to the effects of a redesign of the mixing center network. This redesign improves vehicle velocity through the network and includes changes in traffic flows that resulted in a decline in carloads, with no corresponding decrease in revenues. Ford Motor Company, NS largest customer, has announced potential reductions in vehicle production which could affect NS volumes. However, automotive revenues in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those of 2001, as light vehicle production is predicted to be flat. AUTOMOTIVE (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 885 $ 921 $ 746 Revenues decreased $36 million, or 4%, in 2001, due to a 10% drop in traffic volume. Revenue per unit increased, principally due to rate increases and improved efficiency. This group includes finished vehicles for BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Isuzu, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saab, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Mercedes Benz and Toyota. Chemicals traffic volume decreased 5%, and revenues decreased 1% in 2001. The weak economy depressed shipments of petroleum, plastics, industrial and miscellaneous chemicals. These declines were partially offset by new business through NS Thoroughbred Bulk Transfer (TBT) facilities that handle chemicals and bulk commodities for customers not located on NS served lines. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and a favorable change in the mix of traffic (more longer haul moves). In 2000, chemicals traffic volume increased 15%, and revenues increased 18%, due to a full year of Northern Region operations and the return of traffic that had been diverted because of service issues after the Closing Date. Shipments of miscellaneous chemicals, chlorine, caustic soda and plastics continued to rebound, but sulfur carloads were down due to weak fertilizer markets. Chemicals shipments continued to increase through NS TBT facilities. Chemicals revenues are expected to continue to be adversely affected until the economy recovers. However, NS expects to benefit from new business and improved yields. 31 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) CHEMICALS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 752 $ 756 $ 641 Revenues decreased $4 million, or 1%, in 2001, due to lower traffic volumes that resulted from the weak economy. This group includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes and municipal wastes. Metals and construction traffic volume decreased 7%, and revenues declined 2% in 2001, reflecting weakness in the steel and construction industries. The steel industry recession, which began in 2000, has resulted in excess capacity and the closing of numerous steel mills. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, metals and construction traffic volume increased 29%, and revenues increased 22%, reflecting a full year of operations over the expanded system. Revenue per unit declined, largely due to a change in the mix of traffic. Metals traffic benefited from increased shipments of sheet steel, imported slab steel and ferrous scrap; however, this was tempered by a significant slowdown in the steel industry in the last half of the year. Construction traffic benefited from continued strength in housing starts and highway construction. Metals and construction revenues are expected to suffer from the effects of a continued softness in the steel market. However, increased highway construction in NS service area is expected to mitigate the drop in metals demand. METALS AND CONSTRUCTION (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 674 $ 689 $ 567 Revenues decreased $15 million, or 2%, in 2001, principally due to weakness in the steel industry. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. This group includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks and minerals. Paper, clay and forest products traffic volume declined 8%, and revenues decreased 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Paper shipments were adversely affected by reduced production at many NS served paper mills, a result of sluggish newspaper advertising and soft demand for paper. Lumber traffic began the year weak, 32 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) improved in late summer, but softened late in the year due to short term weakness in housing starts. Revenue per unit increased principally due to higher rates. In 2000, paper, clay and forest products traffic volume increased 5%, and revenues increased 9%, principally due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations. Consolidation in the paper industry and a weakening paper market in the second half of the year contributed to lower carloads during the summer months and into the fall. Weak demand for paper production inputs, such as scrap paper and wood pulp, was tempered by stronger demand for newsprint and printing paper. Paper, clay and forest products revenues are expected to continue to be adversely affected by weak demand in 2002, due to continued consolidations and little anticipated capacity expansion through 2003. NS is pursuing new business using MODALGISTICS(SM), its supply chain focused business unit formed in February 2001. PAPER, CLAY AND FOREST PRODUCTS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 612 $ 630 $ 578 Revenues decreased $18 million, or 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Revenue per unit benefited from higher rates. This group includes lumber and wood products, pulpboard and paper products, woodfibers, woodpulp, scrap paper and clay. NS serves 66 paper mills, 105 paper distribution centers and more than 100 lumber reload centers. Agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume decreased 3%, and revenues declined 1% in 2001, primarily due to reduced shipments of fertilizer. This decline was due to soft farm demand, record high natural gas prices early in the year (which curtailed production of certain fertilizers) and increased imports. This was mitigated by traffic volume increases for grain, flour, wheat and canned goods. The revenue per unit increase was primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume increased 7%, and revenues increased 13%, due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region traffic and modest growth in the Southeast markets. Rate increases and more longer haul (higher revenue per unit) traffic also contributed to the revenue increase. Grain traffic benefited from new shuttle train service that improved service to new and expanded Southeast feed mills. In addition, traffic increased for Midwest grain and sweeteners and consumer goods from the West. Agriculture, consumer products and government revenues in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those of 2001. Continued weakness in the fertilizer market is expected to offset gains in the Southeast feed markets and new business. 33 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) AGRICULTURE, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND GOVERNMENT (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 603 $ 609 $ 539 Revenues decreased $6 million, or 1%, in 2001, principally due to soft farm demand, depressed fertilizer production and increased imports. This group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizers, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products and items for the military. INTERMODAL traffic volume decreased 1%, but revenues increased slightly in 2001. Domestic traffic volume was up in the first half of the year, but demand increasingly weakened as the year progressed, which eroded NS base of traffic. New business supported by the opening of three new terminals and other initiatives mitigated the effects of the weakened economy. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew slightly as U.S. imports slowed with the economy. TCS traffic volume increased 1% despite economic conditions, as it continued to benefit from reliable, trucklike service. Intermodal revenue per unit dropped later in the year, reflecting the expiration of fuel surcharges that were implemented late in 2000 and the introduction of new shorter haul business. In 2000, intermodal traffic volume increased 18%, and revenues increased 32%, primarily due to a full year of Northern Region traffic and the consolidation of TCS revenues (see Note 2 on Page 58). About half of the improvement in revenue per unit resulted from the effects of consolidating TCS. Prior to June 1, 1999, NS revenues included only the amounts for rail services it performed under contract to TCS, but NS volume included most TCS units. Also contributing to the revenue per unit improvement were rate increases throughout the year on domestic business and the implementation of fuel surcharges later in the year. In addition, increased demand, new business and improved service contributed to the gains, as major customers, including UPS, JB Hunt, Hub Group and Maersk, increased volumes. Despite weak demand in the first quarter and the loss in December 1999 of a major customer, NS had regained its market share by the second quarter. Domestic and premium business volumes benefited from service improvements and expansion initiatives. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew 5%, notwithstanding the loss of business from a major customer. TCS traffic increased 3%, as it recovered from service shortcomings after the Closing Date. Intermodal revenues are expected to benefit from continued improvements in service and the terminal capacity added in 2001. 34 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) INTERMODAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 1,123 $ 1,119 $ 849 Revenues increased $4 million in 2001, despite a 1% drop in traffic volume. This group handles trailers, domestic and international containers, TCS equipment and equipment for intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers and other shippers. Railway Operating Expenses Railway operating expenses decreased 7% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. Expenses in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force. Excluding these costs, railway operating expenses decreased 4% in 2001, while carloads dropped 3%; and increased 19% in 2000 on carloads that were 15% higher. The higher expense increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and sharply higher diesel fuel prices. The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, was 83.7% in 2001, compared with 87.0% in 2000 (excluding the work force reduction costs, which increased the ratio 2.7 percentage points) and 86.3% in 1999. The decline in the 2001 ratio reflected the increase in revenue per unit as well as reduced expenses that resulted from gains in efficiency. The increase in the 2000 ratio reflected the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the sharp increase in diesel fuel prices, which more than offset the absence of the significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues after the Closing Date. In addition, the ratio was adversely affected by a change in traffic mix (more resource intensive traffic, such as automotive and intermodal) and the new traffic in the Northern Region, coupled with the decrease in export coal traffic. 35 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications. RAILWAY OPERATING EXPENSES Increases (Decreases) ($ in millions) 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 Compensation and benefits * $ (220) $ 379 Materials, services and rents (1) 171 Conrail rents and services (57) 167 Depreciation 11 28 Diesel fuel (66) 223 Casualties and other claims 1 4 Other (31) 30 Total $ (363) $1,002 * Includes $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Compensation and benefits represented 39% of total railway operating expenses and decreased 10% in 2001, but increased 20% in 2000. Both comparisons reflect the $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Excluding those costs, compensation and benefits decreased 3% in 2001, but increased 12% in 2000. The 3% decline in 2001 reflected savings attributable to the reduced size of the work force. These savings were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees, higher incentive compensation and reduced pension income. The 12% increase in 2000 was largely attributable to the effects of a full year of expanded operations and higher wages and benefit costs for union employees. These increases were mitigated by higher pension income and the absence of the $49 million incurred in 1999 for the Special Work Incentive Program (SWIP) for union employees in the third quarter of 1999. Pension income was higher in 2000 largely due to the transfer of assets from the Conrail pension plan after the Closing Date. NS has substantial unrecognized gains related to its overfunded pension plan; amortization of these gains will continue to be included in "Compensation and benefits" expenses (see Note 11 on Page 68). The Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll taxes. The phase in calls for a reduction from 16.1% in 2001 to 15.6% in 2002, 14.2% in 2003 and 13.1% in 2004. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated. These changes are expected to result in a $21 million reduction to payroll tax expenses in 2002. The new law allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four year reserve or exceed a six year reserve. 36 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Materials, services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses decreased slightly in 2001, but increased 13% in 2000. In 2001, the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services, including expenses for software, consulting and legal fees. The increase in 2000 was mostly attributable to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the consolidation of TCS and was mitigated by the absence of significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 11% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases. The 2000 increase was principally due to the effects of a full year of expanded operations but was mitigated by a favorable comparison for the last seven months, as expenses in 1999 were high due to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Locomotive and equipment repair costs increased in 2001, principally due to renewed maintenance activity. This trend is expected to continue in 2002, driven by higher expenses for freight car repairs. In 2000, maintenance costs increased, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations; however, the increase was tempered by reduced maintenance activities, a result of cost control efforts. Conrail rents and services, a new category of expense beginning in 1999, arose from the expansion of operations on the Closing Date and amounted to $421 million in 2001, $478 million in 2000 and $311 million in 1999. This item includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRCs operation of the Shared Assets Areas. Also included is NS equity in Conrails net earnings since the Closing Date, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between NS investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2 on Page 58). The decline in 2001 reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see "Conrails Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity," below). Expenses in 2000 included a full year of operations over Conrails lines, compared with seven months in 1999. Depreciation expense was up 2% in 2001 and 6% in 2000. Increases in both years were due to property additions, reflecting substantial levels of capital spending (see Note 1, "Properties," on Page 57 for NS depreciation policy). A periodic review of depreciation rates is being finalized, and rates are expected to be somewhat lower. 37 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Diesel fuel expenses decreased 14% in 2001, but increased 87% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in 2001 include $8 million related to the hedging program initiated in the second quarter (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note 16 on Page 77). The increase in 2000 expenses resulted from a 61% rise in the average price per gallon and higher consumption that reflected a full year of Northern Region operations. Casualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased slightly in 2001 and 3% in 2000. The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2001, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 31% of the total employee injury cases settled and 15% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, promotes an adversarial claims environment and produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent. The railroads have been unsuccessful so far in efforts to persuade Congress to replace FELA with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2001, but increased 14% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to lower bad debt costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee relocation expenses. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and higher bad debt expense. Other Income Net Other income net was $99 million in 2001, $168 million in 2000 and $115 million in 1999 (see Note 3 on Page 61). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of certain timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests. This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December. The increase in 2000 reflected the $101 million of gains, mitigated by the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). 38 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2001 was $191 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 31% in 2000 and 32% in 1999. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2001 and 34% in both 2000 and 1999. The effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, both 2000 and 1999 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in 1981. In January 2001, NS received payment from the third party in accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $654 million in 2001, compared with $1.3 billion in 2000 and $533 million in 1999. Results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). Excluding the infusion of cash from this program, operating cash flow declined $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." In 2001, NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $250 million. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital, including an improvement in collection of accounts receivable, a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of bonus payments. The large changes in "Accounts receivable" and "Current liabilities other than debt" in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from the commencement of operations in the Northern Region. In addition, collection of accounts receivable had slowed. NS working capital deficit was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2000. The increase resulted principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. Part of the working capital deficit at Dec. 31, 2001, arises from a $373 million balance in "Notes and accounts payable to Conrail" that is not expected to be repaid in 2002. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part II, Item 7, "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on Page 44 under the heading "Market Risks and Hedging Activities." 49 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Automotive traffic volume decreased 10%, and revenues declined 4% in 2001, principally due to a 10% drop in vehicle production. Revenue per unit increased 7%, principally due to rate increases, efficiencies gained from the redesign of the mixing center network and use of higher capacity equipment. In 2000, automotive traffic volume increased 13%, and revenues increased 23%, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations, record vehicle production and the recapture of business diverted because of service issues after the Closing Date. The carload increase was less than the revenue increase principally due to the effects of a redesign of the mixing center network. This redesign improves vehicle velocity through the network and includes changes in traffic flows that resulted in a decline in carloads, with no corresponding decrease in revenues. Ford Motor Company, NS largest customer, has announced potential reductions in vehicle production which could affect NS volumes. However, automotive revenues in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those of 2001, as light vehicle production is predicted to be flat. AUTOMOTIVE (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 885 $ 921 $ 746 Revenues decreased $36 million, or 4%, in 2001, due to a 10% drop in traffic volume. Revenue per unit increased, principally due to rate increases and improved efficiency. This group includes finished vehicles for BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Isuzu, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saab, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Mercedes Benz and Toyota. Chemicals traffic volume decreased 5%, and revenues decreased 1% in 2001. The weak economy depressed shipments of petroleum, plastics, industrial and miscellaneous chemicals. These declines were partially offset by new business through NS Thoroughbred Bulk Transfer (TBT) facilities that handle chemicals and bulk commodities for customers not located on NS served lines. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and a favorable change in the mix of traffic (more longer haul moves). In 2000, chemicals traffic volume increased 15%, and revenues increased 18%, due to a full year of Northern Region operations and the return of traffic that had been diverted because of service issues after the Closing Date. Shipments of miscellaneous chemicals, chlorine, caustic soda and plastics continued to rebound, but sulfur carloads were down due to weak fertilizer markets. Chemicals shipments continued to increase through NS TBT facilities. Chemicals revenues are expected to continue to be adversely affected until the economy recovers. However, NS expects to benefit from new business and improved yields. 31 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) CHEMICALS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 752 $ 756 $ 641 Revenues decreased $4 million, or 1%, in 2001, due to lower traffic volumes that resulted from the weak economy. This group includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes and municipal wastes. Metals and construction traffic volume decreased 7%, and revenues declined 2% in 2001, reflecting weakness in the steel and construction industries. The steel industry recession, which began in 2000, has resulted in excess capacity and the closing of numerous steel mills. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, metals and construction traffic volume increased 29%, and revenues increased 22%, reflecting a full year of operations over the expanded system. Revenue per unit declined, largely due to a change in the mix of traffic. Metals traffic benefited from increased shipments of sheet steel, imported slab steel and ferrous scrap; however, this was tempered by a significant slowdown in the steel industry in the last half of the year. Construction traffic benefited from continued strength in housing starts and highway construction. Metals and construction revenues are expected to suffer from the effects of a continued softness in the steel market. However, increased highway construction in NS service area is expected to mitigate the drop in metals demand. METALS AND CONSTRUCTION (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 674 $ 689 $ 567 Revenues decreased $15 million, or 2%, in 2001, principally due to weakness in the steel industry. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. This group includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks and minerals. Paper, clay and forest products traffic volume declined 8%, and revenues decreased 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Paper shipments were adversely affected by reduced production at many NS served paper mills, a result of sluggish newspaper advertising and soft demand for paper. Lumber traffic began the year weak, 32 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) improved in late summer, but softened late in the year due to short term weakness in housing starts. Revenue per unit increased principally due to higher rates. In 2000, paper, clay and forest products traffic volume increased 5%, and revenues increased 9%, principally due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations. Consolidation in the paper industry and a weakening paper market in the second half of the year contributed to lower carloads during the summer months and into the fall. Weak demand for paper production inputs, such as scrap paper and wood pulp, was tempered by stronger demand for newsprint and printing paper. Paper, clay and forest products revenues are expected to continue to be adversely affected by weak demand in 2002, due to continued consolidations and little anticipated capacity expansion through 2003. NS is pursuing new business using MODALGISTICS(SM), its supply chain focused business unit formed in February 2001. PAPER, CLAY AND FOREST PRODUCTS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 612 $ 630 $ 578 Revenues decreased $18 million, or 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Revenue per unit benefited from higher rates. This group includes lumber and wood products, pulpboard and paper products, woodfibers, woodpulp, scrap paper and clay. NS serves 66 paper mills, 105 paper distribution centers and more than 100 lumber reload centers. Agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume decreased 3%, and revenues declined 1% in 2001, primarily due to reduced shipments of fertilizer. This decline was due to soft farm demand, record high natural gas prices early in the year (which curtailed production of certain fertilizers) and increased imports. This was mitigated by traffic volume increases for grain, flour, wheat and canned goods. The revenue per unit increase was primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume increased 7%, and revenues increased 13%, due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region traffic and modest growth in the Southeast markets. Rate increases and more longer haul (higher revenue per unit) traffic also contributed to the revenue increase. Grain traffic benefited from new shuttle train service that improved service to new and expanded Southeast feed mills. In addition, traffic increased for Midwest grain and sweeteners and consumer goods from the West. Agriculture, consumer products and government revenues in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those of 2001. Continued weakness in the fertilizer market is expected to offset gains in the Southeast feed markets and new business. 33 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) AGRICULTURE, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND GOVERNMENT (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 603 $ 609 $ 539 Revenues decreased $6 million, or 1%, in 2001, principally due to soft farm demand, depressed fertilizer production and increased imports. This group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizers, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products and items for the military. INTERMODAL traffic volume decreased 1%, but revenues increased slightly in 2001. Domestic traffic volume was up in the first half of the year, but demand increasingly weakened as the year progressed, which eroded NS base of traffic. New business supported by the opening of three new terminals and other initiatives mitigated the effects of the weakened economy. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew slightly as U.S. imports slowed with the economy. TCS traffic volume increased 1% despite economic conditions, as it continued to benefit from reliable, trucklike service. Intermodal revenue per unit dropped later in the year, reflecting the expiration of fuel surcharges that were implemented late in 2000 and the introduction of new shorter haul business. In 2000, intermodal traffic volume increased 18%, and revenues increased 32%, primarily due to a full year of Northern Region traffic and the consolidation of TCS revenues (see Note 2 on Page 58). About half of the improvement in revenue per unit resulted from the effects of consolidating TCS. Prior to June 1, 1999, NS revenues included only the amounts for rail services it performed under contract to TCS, but NS volume included most TCS units. Also contributing to the revenue per unit improvement were rate increases throughout the year on domestic business and the implementation of fuel surcharges later in the year. In addition, increased demand, new business and improved service contributed to the gains, as major customers, including UPS, JB Hunt, Hub Group and Maersk, increased volumes. Despite weak demand in the first quarter and the loss in December 1999 of a major customer, NS had regained its market share by the second quarter. Domestic and premium business volumes benefited from service improvements and expansion initiatives. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew 5%, notwithstanding the loss of business from a major customer. TCS traffic increased 3%, as it recovered from service shortcomings after the Closing Date. Intermodal revenues are expected to benefit from continued improvements in service and the terminal capacity added in 2001. 34 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) INTERMODAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 1,123 $ 1,119 $ 849 Revenues increased $4 million in 2001, despite a 1% drop in traffic volume. This group handles trailers, domestic and international containers, TCS equipment and equipment for intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers and other shippers. Railway Operating Expenses Railway operating expenses decreased 7% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. Expenses in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force. Excluding these costs, railway operating expenses decreased 4% in 2001, while carloads dropped 3%; and increased 19% in 2000 on carloads that were 15% higher. The higher expense increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and sharply higher diesel fuel prices. The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, was 83.7% in 2001, compared with 87.0% in 2000 (excluding the work force reduction costs, which increased the ratio 2.7 percentage points) and 86.3% in 1999. The decline in the 2001 ratio reflected the increase in revenue per unit as well as reduced expenses that resulted from gains in efficiency. The increase in the 2000 ratio reflected the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the sharp increase in diesel fuel prices, which more than offset the absence of the significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues after the Closing Date. In addition, the ratio was adversely affected by a change in traffic mix (more resource intensive traffic, such as automotive and intermodal) and the new traffic in the Northern Region, coupled with the decrease in export coal traffic. 35 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications. RAILWAY OPERATING EXPENSES Increases (Decreases) ($ in millions) 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 Compensation and benefits * $ (220) $ 379 Materials, services and rents (1) 171 Conrail rents and services (57) 167 Depreciation 11 28 Diesel fuel (66) 223 Casualties and other claims 1 4 Other (31) 30 Total $ (363) $1,002 * Includes $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Compensation and benefits represented 39% of total railway operating expenses and decreased 10% in 2001, but increased 20% in 2000. Both comparisons reflect the $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Excluding those costs, compensation and benefits decreased 3% in 2001, but increased 12% in 2000. The 3% decline in 2001 reflected savings attributable to the reduced size of the work force. These savings were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees, higher incentive compensation and reduced pension income. The 12% increase in 2000 was largely attributable to the effects of a full year of expanded operations and higher wages and benefit costs for union employees. These increases were mitigated by higher pension income and the absence of the $49 million incurred in 1999 for the Special Work Incentive Program (SWIP) for union employees in the third quarter of 1999. Pension income was higher in 2000 largely due to the transfer of assets from the Conrail pension plan after the Closing Date. NS has substantial unrecognized gains related to its overfunded pension plan; amortization of these gains will continue to be included in "Compensation and benefits" expenses (see Note 11 on Page 68). The Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll taxes. The phase in calls for a reduction from 16.1% in 2001 to 15.6% in 2002, 14.2% in 2003 and 13.1% in 2004. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated. These changes are expected to result in a $21 million reduction to payroll tax expenses in 2002. The new law allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four year reserve or exceed a six year reserve. 36 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Materials, services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses decreased slightly in 2001, but increased 13% in 2000. In 2001, the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services, including expenses for software, consulting and legal fees. The increase in 2000 was mostly attributable to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the consolidation of TCS and was mitigated by the absence of significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 11% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases. The 2000 increase was principally due to the effects of a full year of expanded operations but was mitigated by a favorable comparison for the last seven months, as expenses in 1999 were high due to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Locomotive and equipment repair costs increased in 2001, principally due to renewed maintenance activity. This trend is expected to continue in 2002, driven by higher expenses for freight car repairs. In 2000, maintenance costs increased, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations; however, the increase was tempered by reduced maintenance activities, a result of cost control efforts. Conrail rents and services, a new category of expense beginning in 1999, arose from the expansion of operations on the Closing Date and amounted to $421 million in 2001, $478 million in 2000 and $311 million in 1999. This item includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRCs operation of the Shared Assets Areas. Also included is NS equity in Conrails net earnings since the Closing Date, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between NS investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2 on Page 58). The decline in 2001 reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see "Conrails Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity," below). Expenses in 2000 included a full year of operations over Conrails lines, compared with seven months in 1999. Depreciation expense was up 2% in 2001 and 6% in 2000. Increases in both years were due to property additions, reflecting substantial levels of capital spending (see Note 1, "Properties," on Page 57 for NS depreciation policy). A periodic review of depreciation rates is being finalized, and rates are expected to be somewhat lower. 37 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Diesel fuel expenses decreased 14% in 2001, but increased 87% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in 2001 include $8 million related to the hedging program initiated in the second quarter (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note 16 on Page 77). The increase in 2000 expenses resulted from a 61% rise in the average price per gallon and higher consumption that reflected a full year of Northern Region operations. Casualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased slightly in 2001 and 3% in 2000. The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2001, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 31% of the total employee injury cases settled and 15% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, promotes an adversarial claims environment and produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent. The railroads have been unsuccessful so far in efforts to persuade Congress to replace FELA with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2001, but increased 14% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to lower bad debt costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee relocation expenses. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and higher bad debt expense. Other Income Net Other income net was $99 million in 2001, $168 million in 2000 and $115 million in 1999 (see Note 3 on Page 61). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of certain timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests. This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December. The increase in 2000 reflected the $101 million of gains, mitigated by the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). 38 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2001 was $191 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 31% in 2000 and 32% in 1999. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2001 and 34% in both 2000 and 1999. The effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, both 2000 and 1999 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in 1981. In January 2001, NS received payment from the third party in accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $654 million in 2001, compared with $1.3 billion in 2000 and $533 million in 1999. Results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). Excluding the infusion of cash from this program, operating cash flow declined $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." In 2001, NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $250 million. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital, including an improvement in collection of accounts receivable, a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of bonus payments. The large changes in "Accounts receivable" and "Current liabilities other than debt" in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from the commencement of operations in the Northern Region. In addition, collection of accounts receivable had slowed. NS working capital deficit was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2000. The increase resulted principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. Part of the working capital deficit at Dec. 31, 2001, arises from a $373 million balance in "Notes and accounts payable to Conrail" that is not expected to be repaid in 2002. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) CHEMICALS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 752 $ 756 $ 641 Revenues decreased $4 million, or 1%, in 2001, due to lower traffic volumes that resulted from the weak economy. This group includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes and municipal wastes. Metals and construction traffic volume decreased 7%, and revenues declined 2% in 2001, reflecting weakness in the steel and construction industries. The steel industry recession, which began in 2000, has resulted in excess capacity and the closing of numerous steel mills. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, metals and construction traffic volume increased 29%, and revenues increased 22%, reflecting a full year of operations over the expanded system. Revenue per unit declined, largely due to a change in the mix of traffic. Metals traffic benefited from increased shipments of sheet steel, imported slab steel and ferrous scrap; however, this was tempered by a significant slowdown in the steel industry in the last half of the year. Construction traffic benefited from continued strength in housing starts and highway construction. Metals and construction revenues are expected to suffer from the effects of a continued softness in the steel market. However, increased highway construction in NS service area is expected to mitigate the drop in metals demand. METALS AND CONSTRUCTION (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 674 $ 689 $ 567 Revenues decreased $15 million, or 2%, in 2001, principally due to weakness in the steel industry. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. This group includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks and minerals. Paper, clay and forest products traffic volume declined 8%, and revenues decreased 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Paper shipments were adversely affected by reduced production at many NS served paper mills, a result of sluggish newspaper advertising and soft demand for paper. Lumber traffic began the year weak, 32 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) improved in late summer, but softened late in the year due to short term weakness in housing starts. Revenue per unit increased principally due to higher rates. In 2000, paper, clay and forest products traffic volume increased 5%, and revenues increased 9%, principally due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations. Consolidation in the paper industry and a weakening paper market in the second half of the year contributed to lower carloads during the summer months and into the fall. Weak demand for paper production inputs, such as scrap paper and wood pulp, was tempered by stronger demand for newsprint and printing paper. Paper, clay and forest products revenues are expected to continue to be adversely affected by weak demand in 2002, due to continued consolidations and little anticipated capacity expansion through 2003. NS is pursuing new business using MODALGISTICS(SM), its supply chain focused business unit formed in February 2001. PAPER, CLAY AND FOREST PRODUCTS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 612 $ 630 $ 578 Revenues decreased $18 million, or 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Revenue per unit benefited from higher rates. This group includes lumber and wood products, pulpboard and paper products, woodfibers, woodpulp, scrap paper and clay. NS serves 66 paper mills, 105 paper distribution centers and more than 100 lumber reload centers. Agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume decreased 3%, and revenues declined 1% in 2001, primarily due to reduced shipments of fertilizer. This decline was due to soft farm demand, record high natural gas prices early in the year (which curtailed production of certain fertilizers) and increased imports. This was mitigated by traffic volume increases for grain, flour, wheat and canned goods. The revenue per unit increase was primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume increased 7%, and revenues increased 13%, due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region traffic and modest growth in the Southeast markets. Rate increases and more longer haul (higher revenue per unit) traffic also contributed to the revenue increase. Grain traffic benefited from new shuttle train service that improved service to new and expanded Southeast feed mills. In addition, traffic increased for Midwest grain and sweeteners and consumer goods from the West. Agriculture, consumer products and government revenues in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those of 2001. Continued weakness in the fertilizer market is expected to offset gains in the Southeast feed markets and new business. 33 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) AGRICULTURE, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND GOVERNMENT (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 603 $ 609 $ 539 Revenues decreased $6 million, or 1%, in 2001, principally due to soft farm demand, depressed fertilizer production and increased imports. This group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizers, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products and items for the military. INTERMODAL traffic volume decreased 1%, but revenues increased slightly in 2001. Domestic traffic volume was up in the first half of the year, but demand increasingly weakened as the year progressed, which eroded NS base of traffic. New business supported by the opening of three new terminals and other initiatives mitigated the effects of the weakened economy. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew slightly as U.S. imports slowed with the economy. TCS traffic volume increased 1% despite economic conditions, as it continued to benefit from reliable, trucklike service. Intermodal revenue per unit dropped later in the year, reflecting the expiration of fuel surcharges that were implemented late in 2000 and the introduction of new shorter haul business. In 2000, intermodal traffic volume increased 18%, and revenues increased 32%, primarily due to a full year of Northern Region traffic and the consolidation of TCS revenues (see Note 2 on Page 58). About half of the improvement in revenue per unit resulted from the effects of consolidating TCS. Prior to June 1, 1999, NS revenues included only the amounts for rail services it performed under contract to TCS, but NS volume included most TCS units. Also contributing to the revenue per unit improvement were rate increases throughout the year on domestic business and the implementation of fuel surcharges later in the year. In addition, increased demand, new business and improved service contributed to the gains, as major customers, including UPS, JB Hunt, Hub Group and Maersk, increased volumes. Despite weak demand in the first quarter and the loss in December 1999 of a major customer, NS had regained its market share by the second quarter. Domestic and premium business volumes benefited from service improvements and expansion initiatives. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew 5%, notwithstanding the loss of business from a major customer. TCS traffic increased 3%, as it recovered from service shortcomings after the Closing Date. Intermodal revenues are expected to benefit from continued improvements in service and the terminal capacity added in 2001. 34 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) INTERMODAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 1,123 $ 1,119 $ 849 Revenues increased $4 million in 2001, despite a 1% drop in traffic volume. This group handles trailers, domestic and international containers, TCS equipment and equipment for intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers and other shippers. Railway Operating Expenses Railway operating expenses decreased 7% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. Expenses in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force. Excluding these costs, railway operating expenses decreased 4% in 2001, while carloads dropped 3%; and increased 19% in 2000 on carloads that were 15% higher. The higher expense increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and sharply higher diesel fuel prices. The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, was 83.7% in 2001, compared with 87.0% in 2000 (excluding the work force reduction costs, which increased the ratio 2.7 percentage points) and 86.3% in 1999. The decline in the 2001 ratio reflected the increase in revenue per unit as well as reduced expenses that resulted from gains in efficiency. The increase in the 2000 ratio reflected the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the sharp increase in diesel fuel prices, which more than offset the absence of the significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues after the Closing Date. In addition, the ratio was adversely affected by a change in traffic mix (more resource intensive traffic, such as automotive and intermodal) and the new traffic in the Northern Region, coupled with the decrease in export coal traffic. 35 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications. RAILWAY OPERATING EXPENSES Increases (Decreases) ($ in millions) 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 Compensation and benefits * $ (220) $ 379 Materials, services and rents (1) 171 Conrail rents and services (57) 167 Depreciation 11 28 Diesel fuel (66) 223 Casualties and other claims 1 4 Other (31) 30 Total $ (363) $1,002 * Includes $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Compensation and benefits represented 39% of total railway operating expenses and decreased 10% in 2001, but increased 20% in 2000. Both comparisons reflect the $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Excluding those costs, compensation and benefits decreased 3% in 2001, but increased 12% in 2000. The 3% decline in 2001 reflected savings attributable to the reduced size of the work force. These savings were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees, higher incentive compensation and reduced pension income. The 12% increase in 2000 was largely attributable to the effects of a full year of expanded operations and higher wages and benefit costs for union employees. These increases were mitigated by higher pension income and the absence of the $49 million incurred in 1999 for the Special Work Incentive Program (SWIP) for union employees in the third quarter of 1999. Pension income was higher in 2000 largely due to the transfer of assets from the Conrail pension plan after the Closing Date. NS has substantial unrecognized gains related to its overfunded pension plan; amortization of these gains will continue to be included in "Compensation and benefits" expenses (see Note 11 on Page 68). The Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll taxes. The phase in calls for a reduction from 16.1% in 2001 to 15.6% in 2002, 14.2% in 2003 and 13.1% in 2004. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated. These changes are expected to result in a $21 million reduction to payroll tax expenses in 2002. The new law allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four year reserve or exceed a six year reserve. 36 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Materials, services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses decreased slightly in 2001, but increased 13% in 2000. In 2001, the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services, including expenses for software, consulting and legal fees. The increase in 2000 was mostly attributable to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the consolidation of TCS and was mitigated by the absence of significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 11% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases. The 2000 increase was principally due to the effects of a full year of expanded operations but was mitigated by a favorable comparison for the last seven months, as expenses in 1999 were high due to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Locomotive and equipment repair costs increased in 2001, principally due to renewed maintenance activity. This trend is expected to continue in 2002, driven by higher expenses for freight car repairs. In 2000, maintenance costs increased, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations; however, the increase was tempered by reduced maintenance activities, a result of cost control efforts. Conrail rents and services, a new category of expense beginning in 1999, arose from the expansion of operations on the Closing Date and amounted to $421 million in 2001, $478 million in 2000 and $311 million in 1999. This item includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRCs operation of the Shared Assets Areas. Also included is NS equity in Conrails net earnings since the Closing Date, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between NS investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2 on Page 58). The decline in 2001 reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see "Conrails Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity," below). Expenses in 2000 included a full year of operations over Conrails lines, compared with seven months in 1999. Depreciation expense was up 2% in 2001 and 6% in 2000. Increases in both years were due to property additions, reflecting substantial levels of capital spending (see Note 1, "Properties," on Page 57 for NS depreciation policy). A periodic review of depreciation rates is being finalized, and rates are expected to be somewhat lower. 37 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Diesel fuel expenses decreased 14% in 2001, but increased 87% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in 2001 include $8 million related to the hedging program initiated in the second quarter (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note 16 on Page 77). The increase in 2000 expenses resulted from a 61% rise in the average price per gallon and higher consumption that reflected a full year of Northern Region operations. Casualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased slightly in 2001 and 3% in 2000. The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2001, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 31% of the total employee injury cases settled and 15% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, promotes an adversarial claims environment and produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent. The railroads have been unsuccessful so far in efforts to persuade Congress to replace FELA with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2001, but increased 14% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to lower bad debt costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee relocation expenses. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and higher bad debt expense. Other Income Net Other income net was $99 million in 2001, $168 million in 2000 and $115 million in 1999 (see Note 3 on Page 61). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of certain timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests. This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December. The increase in 2000 reflected the $101 million of gains, mitigated by the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). 38 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2001 was $191 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 31% in 2000 and 32% in 1999. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2001 and 34% in both 2000 and 1999. The effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, both 2000 and 1999 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in 1981. In January 2001, NS received payment from the third party in accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $654 million in 2001, compared with $1.3 billion in 2000 and $533 million in 1999. Results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). Excluding the infusion of cash from this program, operating cash flow declined $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." In 2001, NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $250 million. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital, including an improvement in collection of accounts receivable, a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of bonus payments. The large changes in "Accounts receivable" and "Current liabilities other than debt" in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from the commencement of operations in the Northern Region. In addition, collection of accounts receivable had slowed. NS working capital deficit was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2000. The increase resulted principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. Part of the working capital deficit at Dec. 31, 2001, arises from a $373 million balance in "Notes and accounts payable to Conrail" that is not expected to be repaid in 2002. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part II, Item 7, "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on Page 44 under the heading "Market Risks and Hedging Activities." 49 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) improved in late summer, but softened late in the year due to short term weakness in housing starts. Revenue per unit increased principally due to higher rates. In 2000, paper, clay and forest products traffic volume increased 5%, and revenues increased 9%, principally due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations. Consolidation in the paper industry and a weakening paper market in the second half of the year contributed to lower carloads during the summer months and into the fall. Weak demand for paper production inputs, such as scrap paper and wood pulp, was tempered by stronger demand for newsprint and printing paper. Paper, clay and forest products revenues are expected to continue to be adversely affected by weak demand in 2002, due to continued consolidations and little anticipated capacity expansion through 2003. NS is pursuing new business using MODALGISTICS(SM), its supply chain focused business unit formed in February 2001. PAPER, CLAY AND FOREST PRODUCTS (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 612 $ 630 $ 578 Revenues decreased $18 million, or 3%, in 2001, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Revenue per unit benefited from higher rates. This group includes lumber and wood products, pulpboard and paper products, woodfibers, woodpulp, scrap paper and clay. NS serves 66 paper mills, 105 paper distribution centers and more than 100 lumber reload centers. Agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume decreased 3%, and revenues declined 1% in 2001, primarily due to reduced shipments of fertilizer. This decline was due to soft farm demand, record high natural gas prices early in the year (which curtailed production of certain fertilizers) and increased imports. This was mitigated by traffic volume increases for grain, flour, wheat and canned goods. The revenue per unit increase was primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2000, agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume increased 7%, and revenues increased 13%, due to the effects of a full year of Northern Region traffic and modest growth in the Southeast markets. Rate increases and more longer haul (higher revenue per unit) traffic also contributed to the revenue increase. Grain traffic benefited from new shuttle train service that improved service to new and expanded Southeast feed mills. In addition, traffic increased for Midwest grain and sweeteners and consumer goods from the West. Agriculture, consumer products and government revenues in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those of 2001. Continued weakness in the fertilizer market is expected to offset gains in the Southeast feed markets and new business. 33 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) AGRICULTURE, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND GOVERNMENT (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 603 $ 609 $ 539 Revenues decreased $6 million, or 1%, in 2001, principally due to soft farm demand, depressed fertilizer production and increased imports. This group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizers, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products and items for the military. INTERMODAL traffic volume decreased 1%, but revenues increased slightly in 2001. Domestic traffic volume was up in the first half of the year, but demand increasingly weakened as the year progressed, which eroded NS base of traffic. New business supported by the opening of three new terminals and other initiatives mitigated the effects of the weakened economy. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew slightly as U.S. imports slowed with the economy. TCS traffic volume increased 1% despite economic conditions, as it continued to benefit from reliable, trucklike service. Intermodal revenue per unit dropped later in the year, reflecting the expiration of fuel surcharges that were implemented late in 2000 and the introduction of new shorter haul business. In 2000, intermodal traffic volume increased 18%, and revenues increased 32%, primarily due to a full year of Northern Region traffic and the consolidation of TCS revenues (see Note 2 on Page 58). About half of the improvement in revenue per unit resulted from the effects of consolidating TCS. Prior to June 1, 1999, NS revenues included only the amounts for rail services it performed under contract to TCS, but NS volume included most TCS units. Also contributing to the revenue per unit improvement were rate increases throughout the year on domestic business and the implementation of fuel surcharges later in the year. In addition, increased demand, new business and improved service contributed to the gains, as major customers, including UPS, JB Hunt, Hub Group and Maersk, increased volumes. Despite weak demand in the first quarter and the loss in December 1999 of a major customer, NS had regained its market share by the second quarter. Domestic and premium business volumes benefited from service improvements and expansion initiatives. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew 5%, notwithstanding the loss of business from a major customer. TCS traffic increased 3%, as it recovered from service shortcomings after the Closing Date. Intermodal revenues are expected to benefit from continued improvements in service and the terminal capacity added in 2001. 34 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) INTERMODAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 1,123 $ 1,119 $ 849 Revenues increased $4 million in 2001, despite a 1% drop in traffic volume. This group handles trailers, domestic and international containers, TCS equipment and equipment for intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers and other shippers. Railway Operating Expenses Railway operating expenses decreased 7% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. Expenses in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force. Excluding these costs, railway operating expenses decreased 4% in 2001, while carloads dropped 3%; and increased 19% in 2000 on carloads that were 15% higher. The higher expense increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and sharply higher diesel fuel prices. The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, was 83.7% in 2001, compared with 87.0% in 2000 (excluding the work force reduction costs, which increased the ratio 2.7 percentage points) and 86.3% in 1999. The decline in the 2001 ratio reflected the increase in revenue per unit as well as reduced expenses that resulted from gains in efficiency. The increase in the 2000 ratio reflected the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the sharp increase in diesel fuel prices, which more than offset the absence of the significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues after the Closing Date. In addition, the ratio was adversely affected by a change in traffic mix (more resource intensive traffic, such as automotive and intermodal) and the new traffic in the Northern Region, coupled with the decrease in export coal traffic. 35 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications. RAILWAY OPERATING EXPENSES Increases (Decreases) ($ in millions) 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 Compensation and benefits * $ (220) $ 379 Materials, services and rents (1) 171 Conrail rents and services (57) 167 Depreciation 11 28 Diesel fuel (66) 223 Casualties and other claims 1 4 Other (31) 30 Total $ (363) $1,002 * Includes $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Compensation and benefits represented 39% of total railway operating expenses and decreased 10% in 2001, but increased 20% in 2000. Both comparisons reflect the $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Excluding those costs, compensation and benefits decreased 3% in 2001, but increased 12% in 2000. The 3% decline in 2001 reflected savings attributable to the reduced size of the work force. These savings were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees, higher incentive compensation and reduced pension income. The 12% increase in 2000 was largely attributable to the effects of a full year of expanded operations and higher wages and benefit costs for union employees. These increases were mitigated by higher pension income and the absence of the $49 million incurred in 1999 for the Special Work Incentive Program (SWIP) for union employees in the third quarter of 1999. Pension income was higher in 2000 largely due to the transfer of assets from the Conrail pension plan after the Closing Date. NS has substantial unrecognized gains related to its overfunded pension plan; amortization of these gains will continue to be included in "Compensation and benefits" expenses (see Note 11 on Page 68). The Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll taxes. The phase in calls for a reduction from 16.1% in 2001 to 15.6% in 2002, 14.2% in 2003 and 13.1% in 2004. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated. These changes are expected to result in a $21 million reduction to payroll tax expenses in 2002. The new law allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four year reserve or exceed a six year reserve. 36 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Materials, services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses decreased slightly in 2001, but increased 13% in 2000. In 2001, the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services, including expenses for software, consulting and legal fees. The increase in 2000 was mostly attributable to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the consolidation of TCS and was mitigated by the absence of significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 11% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases. The 2000 increase was principally due to the effects of a full year of expanded operations but was mitigated by a favorable comparison for the last seven months, as expenses in 1999 were high due to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Locomotive and equipment repair costs increased in 2001, principally due to renewed maintenance activity. This trend is expected to continue in 2002, driven by higher expenses for freight car repairs. In 2000, maintenance costs increased, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations; however, the increase was tempered by reduced maintenance activities, a result of cost control efforts. Conrail rents and services, a new category of expense beginning in 1999, arose from the expansion of operations on the Closing Date and amounted to $421 million in 2001, $478 million in 2000 and $311 million in 1999. This item includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRCs operation of the Shared Assets Areas. Also included is NS equity in Conrails net earnings since the Closing Date, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between NS investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2 on Page 58). The decline in 2001 reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see "Conrails Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity," below). Expenses in 2000 included a full year of operations over Conrails lines, compared with seven months in 1999. Depreciation expense was up 2% in 2001 and 6% in 2000. Increases in both years were due to property additions, reflecting substantial levels of capital spending (see Note 1, "Properties," on Page 57 for NS depreciation policy). A periodic review of depreciation rates is being finalized, and rates are expected to be somewhat lower. 37 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Diesel fuel expenses decreased 14% in 2001, but increased 87% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in 2001 include $8 million related to the hedging program initiated in the second quarter (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note 16 on Page 77). The increase in 2000 expenses resulted from a 61% rise in the average price per gallon and higher consumption that reflected a full year of Northern Region operations. Casualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased slightly in 2001 and 3% in 2000. The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2001, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 31% of the total employee injury cases settled and 15% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, promotes an adversarial claims environment and produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent. The railroads have been unsuccessful so far in efforts to persuade Congress to replace FELA with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2001, but increased 14% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to lower bad debt costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee relocation expenses. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and higher bad debt expense. Other Income Net Other income net was $99 million in 2001, $168 million in 2000 and $115 million in 1999 (see Note 3 on Page 61). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of certain timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests. This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December. The increase in 2000 reflected the $101 million of gains, mitigated by the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). 38 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2001 was $191 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 31% in 2000 and 32% in 1999. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2001 and 34% in both 2000 and 1999. The effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, both 2000 and 1999 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in 1981. In January 2001, NS received payment from the third party in accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $654 million in 2001, compared with $1.3 billion in 2000 and $533 million in 1999. Results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). Excluding the infusion of cash from this program, operating cash flow declined $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." In 2001, NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $250 million. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital, including an improvement in collection of accounts receivable, a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of bonus payments. The large changes in "Accounts receivable" and "Current liabilities other than debt" in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from the commencement of operations in the Northern Region. In addition, collection of accounts receivable had slowed. NS working capital deficit was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2000. The increase resulted principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. Part of the working capital deficit at Dec. 31, 2001, arises from a $373 million balance in "Notes and accounts payable to Conrail" that is not expected to be repaid in 2002. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) AGRICULTURE, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND GOVERNMENT (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 603 $ 609 $ 539 Revenues decreased $6 million, or 1%, in 2001, principally due to soft farm demand, depressed fertilizer production and increased imports. This group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizers, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products and items for the military. INTERMODAL traffic volume decreased 1%, but revenues increased slightly in 2001. Domestic traffic volume was up in the first half of the year, but demand increasingly weakened as the year progressed, which eroded NS base of traffic. New business supported by the opening of three new terminals and other initiatives mitigated the effects of the weakened economy. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew slightly as U.S. imports slowed with the economy. TCS traffic volume increased 1% despite economic conditions, as it continued to benefit from reliable, trucklike service. Intermodal revenue per unit dropped later in the year, reflecting the expiration of fuel surcharges that were implemented late in 2000 and the introduction of new shorter haul business. In 2000, intermodal traffic volume increased 18%, and revenues increased 32%, primarily due to a full year of Northern Region traffic and the consolidation of TCS revenues (see Note 2 on Page 58). About half of the improvement in revenue per unit resulted from the effects of consolidating TCS. Prior to June 1, 1999, NS revenues included only the amounts for rail services it performed under contract to TCS, but NS volume included most TCS units. Also contributing to the revenue per unit improvement were rate increases throughout the year on domestic business and the implementation of fuel surcharges later in the year. In addition, increased demand, new business and improved service contributed to the gains, as major customers, including UPS, JB Hunt, Hub Group and Maersk, increased volumes. Despite weak demand in the first quarter and the loss in December 1999 of a major customer, NS had regained its market share by the second quarter. Domestic and premium business volumes benefited from service improvements and expansion initiatives. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, grew 5%, notwithstanding the loss of business from a major customer. TCS traffic increased 3%, as it recovered from service shortcomings after the Closing Date. Intermodal revenues are expected to benefit from continued improvements in service and the terminal capacity added in 2001. 34 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) INTERMODAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 1,123 $ 1,119 $ 849 Revenues increased $4 million in 2001, despite a 1% drop in traffic volume. This group handles trailers, domestic and international containers, TCS equipment and equipment for intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers and other shippers. Railway Operating Expenses Railway operating expenses decreased 7% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. Expenses in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force. Excluding these costs, railway operating expenses decreased 4% in 2001, while carloads dropped 3%; and increased 19% in 2000 on carloads that were 15% higher. The higher expense increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and sharply higher diesel fuel prices. The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, was 83.7% in 2001, compared with 87.0% in 2000 (excluding the work force reduction costs, which increased the ratio 2.7 percentage points) and 86.3% in 1999. The decline in the 2001 ratio reflected the increase in revenue per unit as well as reduced expenses that resulted from gains in efficiency. The increase in the 2000 ratio reflected the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the sharp increase in diesel fuel prices, which more than offset the absence of the significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues after the Closing Date. In addition, the ratio was adversely affected by a change in traffic mix (more resource intensive traffic, such as automotive and intermodal) and the new traffic in the Northern Region, coupled with the decrease in export coal traffic. 35 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications. RAILWAY OPERATING EXPENSES Increases (Decreases) ($ in millions) 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 Compensation and benefits * $ (220) $ 379 Materials, services and rents (1) 171 Conrail rents and services (57) 167 Depreciation 11 28 Diesel fuel (66) 223 Casualties and other claims 1 4 Other (31) 30 Total $ (363) $1,002 * Includes $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Compensation and benefits represented 39% of total railway operating expenses and decreased 10% in 2001, but increased 20% in 2000. Both comparisons reflect the $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Excluding those costs, compensation and benefits decreased 3% in 2001, but increased 12% in 2000. The 3% decline in 2001 reflected savings attributable to the reduced size of the work force. These savings were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees, higher incentive compensation and reduced pension income. The 12% increase in 2000 was largely attributable to the effects of a full year of expanded operations and higher wages and benefit costs for union employees. These increases were mitigated by higher pension income and the absence of the $49 million incurred in 1999 for the Special Work Incentive Program (SWIP) for union employees in the third quarter of 1999. Pension income was higher in 2000 largely due to the transfer of assets from the Conrail pension plan after the Closing Date. NS has substantial unrecognized gains related to its overfunded pension plan; amortization of these gains will continue to be included in "Compensation and benefits" expenses (see Note 11 on Page 68). The Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll taxes. The phase in calls for a reduction from 16.1% in 2001 to 15.6% in 2002, 14.2% in 2003 and 13.1% in 2004. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated. These changes are expected to result in a $21 million reduction to payroll tax expenses in 2002. The new law allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four year reserve or exceed a six year reserve. 36 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Materials, services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses decreased slightly in 2001, but increased 13% in 2000. In 2001, the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services, including expenses for software, consulting and legal fees. The increase in 2000 was mostly attributable to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the consolidation of TCS and was mitigated by the absence of significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 11% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases. The 2000 increase was principally due to the effects of a full year of expanded operations but was mitigated by a favorable comparison for the last seven months, as expenses in 1999 were high due to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Locomotive and equipment repair costs increased in 2001, principally due to renewed maintenance activity. This trend is expected to continue in 2002, driven by higher expenses for freight car repairs. In 2000, maintenance costs increased, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations; however, the increase was tempered by reduced maintenance activities, a result of cost control efforts. Conrail rents and services, a new category of expense beginning in 1999, arose from the expansion of operations on the Closing Date and amounted to $421 million in 2001, $478 million in 2000 and $311 million in 1999. This item includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRCs operation of the Shared Assets Areas. Also included is NS equity in Conrails net earnings since the Closing Date, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between NS investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2 on Page 58). The decline in 2001 reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see "Conrails Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity," below). Expenses in 2000 included a full year of operations over Conrails lines, compared with seven months in 1999. Depreciation expense was up 2% in 2001 and 6% in 2000. Increases in both years were due to property additions, reflecting substantial levels of capital spending (see Note 1, "Properties," on Page 57 for NS depreciation policy). A periodic review of depreciation rates is being finalized, and rates are expected to be somewhat lower. 37 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Diesel fuel expenses decreased 14% in 2001, but increased 87% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in 2001 include $8 million related to the hedging program initiated in the second quarter (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note 16 on Page 77). The increase in 2000 expenses resulted from a 61% rise in the average price per gallon and higher consumption that reflected a full year of Northern Region operations. Casualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased slightly in 2001 and 3% in 2000. The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2001, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 31% of the total employee injury cases settled and 15% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, promotes an adversarial claims environment and produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent. The railroads have been unsuccessful so far in efforts to persuade Congress to replace FELA with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2001, but increased 14% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to lower bad debt costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee relocation expenses. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and higher bad debt expense. Other Income Net Other income net was $99 million in 2001, $168 million in 2000 and $115 million in 1999 (see Note 3 on Page 61). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of certain timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests. This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December. The increase in 2000 reflected the $101 million of gains, mitigated by the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). 38 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2001 was $191 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 31% in 2000 and 32% in 1999. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2001 and 34% in both 2000 and 1999. The effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, both 2000 and 1999 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in 1981. In January 2001, NS received payment from the third party in accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $654 million in 2001, compared with $1.3 billion in 2000 and $533 million in 1999. Results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). Excluding the infusion of cash from this program, operating cash flow declined $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." In 2001, NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $250 million. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital, including an improvement in collection of accounts receivable, a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of bonus payments. The large changes in "Accounts receivable" and "Current liabilities other than debt" in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from the commencement of operations in the Northern Region. In addition, collection of accounts receivable had slowed. NS working capital deficit was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2000. The increase resulted principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. Part of the working capital deficit at Dec. 31, 2001, arises from a $373 million balance in "Notes and accounts payable to Conrail" that is not expected to be repaid in 2002. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7.

(continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part II, Item 7, "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on Page 44 under the heading "Market Risks and Hedging Activities." 49 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) INTERMODAL (Shown as a graph in the Annual Report to Stockholders) (millions) 2001 2000 1999 $ 1,123 $ 1,119 $ 849 Revenues increased $4 million in 2001, despite a 1% drop in traffic volume. This group handles trailers, domestic and international containers, TCS equipment and equipment for intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers and other shippers. Railway Operating Expenses Railway operating expenses decreased 7% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. Expenses in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force. Excluding these costs, railway operating expenses decreased 4% in 2001, while carloads dropped 3%; and increased 19% in 2000 on carloads that were 15% higher. The higher expense increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and sharply higher diesel fuel prices. The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, was 83.7% in 2001, compared with 87.0% in 2000 (excluding the work force reduction costs, which increased the ratio 2.7 percentage points) and 86.3% in 1999. The decline in the 2001 ratio reflected the increase in revenue per unit as well as reduced expenses that resulted from gains in efficiency. The increase in the 2000 ratio reflected the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the sharp increase in diesel fuel prices, which more than offset the absence of the significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues after the Closing Date. In addition, the ratio was adversely affected by a change in traffic mix (more resource intensive traffic, such as automotive and intermodal) and the new traffic in the Northern Region, coupled with the decrease in export coal traffic. 35 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications. RAILWAY OPERATING EXPENSES Increases (Decreases) ($ in millions) 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 Compensation and benefits * $ (220) $ 379 Materials, services and rents (1) 171 Conrail rents and services (57) 167 Depreciation 11 28 Diesel fuel (66) 223 Casualties and other claims 1 4 Other (31) 30 Total $ (363) $1,002 * Includes $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Compensation and benefits represented 39% of total railway operating expenses and decreased 10% in 2001, but increased 20% in 2000. Both comparisons reflect the $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Excluding those costs, compensation and benefits decreased 3% in 2001, but increased 12% in 2000. The 3% decline in 2001 reflected savings attributable to the reduced size of the work force. These savings were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees, higher incentive compensation and reduced pension income. The 12% increase in 2000 was largely attributable to the effects of a full year of expanded operations and higher wages and benefit costs for union employees. These increases were mitigated by higher pension income and the absence of the $49 million incurred in 1999 for the Special Work Incentive Program (SWIP) for union employees in the third quarter of 1999. Pension income was higher in 2000 largely due to the transfer of assets from the Conrail pension plan after the Closing Date. NS has substantial unrecognized gains related to its overfunded pension plan; amortization of these gains will continue to be included in "Compensation and benefits" expenses (see Note 11 on Page 68). The Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll taxes. The phase in calls for a reduction from 16.1% in 2001 to 15.6% in 2002, 14.2% in 2003 and 13.1% in 2004. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated. These changes are expected to result in a $21 million reduction to payroll tax expenses in 2002. The new law allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four year reserve or exceed a six year reserve. 36 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Materials, services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses decreased slightly in 2001, but increased 13% in 2000. In 2001, the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services, including expenses for software, consulting and legal fees. The increase in 2000 was mostly attributable to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the consolidation of TCS and was mitigated by the absence of significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 11% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases. The 2000 increase was principally due to the effects of a full year of expanded operations but was mitigated by a favorable comparison for the last seven months, as expenses in 1999 were high due to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Locomotive and equipment repair costs increased in 2001, principally due to renewed maintenance activity. This trend is expected to continue in 2002, driven by higher expenses for freight car repairs. In 2000, maintenance costs increased, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations; however, the increase was tempered by reduced maintenance activities, a result of cost control efforts. Conrail rents and services, a new category of expense beginning in 1999, arose from the expansion of operations on the Closing Date and amounted to $421 million in 2001, $478 million in 2000 and $311 million in 1999. This item includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRCs operation of the Shared Assets Areas. Also included is NS equity in Conrails net earnings since the Closing Date, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between NS investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2 on Page 58). The decline in 2001 reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see "Conrails Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity," below). Expenses in 2000 included a full year of operations over Conrails lines, compared with seven months in 1999. Depreciation expense was up 2% in 2001 and 6% in 2000. Increases in both years were due to property additions, reflecting substantial levels of capital spending (see Note 1, "Properties," on Page 57 for NS depreciation policy). A periodic review of depreciation rates is being finalized, and rates are expected to be somewhat lower. 37 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Diesel fuel expenses decreased 14% in 2001, but increased 87% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in 2001 include $8 million related to the hedging program initiated in the second quarter (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note 16 on Page 77). The increase in 2000 expenses resulted from a 61% rise in the average price per gallon and higher consumption that reflected a full year of Northern Region operations. Casualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased slightly in 2001 and 3% in 2000. The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2001, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 31% of the total employee injury cases settled and 15% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, promotes an adversarial claims environment and produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent. The railroads have been unsuccessful so far in efforts to persuade Congress to replace FELA with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2001, but increased 14% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to lower bad debt costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee relocation expenses. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and higher bad debt expense. Other Income Net Other income net was $99 million in 2001, $168 million in 2000 and $115 million in 1999 (see Note 3 on Page 61). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of certain timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests. This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December. The increase in 2000 reflected the $101 million of gains, mitigated by the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). 38 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2001 was $191 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 31% in 2000 and 32% in 1999. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2001 and 34% in both 2000 and 1999. The effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, both 2000 and 1999 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in 1981. In January 2001, NS received payment from the third party in accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $654 million in 2001, compared with $1.3 billion in 2000 and $533 million in 1999. Results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). Excluding the infusion of cash from this program, operating cash flow declined $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." In 2001, NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $250 million. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital, including an improvement in collection of accounts receivable, a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of bonus payments. The large changes in "Accounts receivable" and "Current liabilities other than debt" in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from the commencement of operations in the Northern Region. In addition, collection of accounts receivable had slowed. NS working capital deficit was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2000. The increase resulted principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. Part of the working capital deficit at Dec. 31, 2001, arises from a $373 million balance in "Notes and accounts payable to Conrail" that is not expected to be repaid in 2002. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part II, Item 7, "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on Page 44 under the heading "Market Risks and Hedging Activities." 49 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications. RAILWAY OPERATING EXPENSES Increases (Decreases) ($ in millions) 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 Compensation and benefits * $ (220) $ 379 Materials, services and rents (1) 171 Conrail rents and services (57) 167 Depreciation 11 28 Diesel fuel (66) 223 Casualties and other claims 1 4 Other (31) 30 Total $ (363) $1,002 * Includes $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Compensation and benefits represented 39% of total railway operating expenses and decreased 10% in 2001, but increased 20% in 2000. Both comparisons reflect the $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Excluding those costs, compensation and benefits decreased 3% in 2001, but increased 12% in 2000. The 3% decline in 2001 reflected savings attributable to the reduced size of the work force. These savings were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees, higher incentive compensation and reduced pension income. The 12% increase in 2000 was largely attributable to the effects of a full year of expanded operations and higher wages and benefit costs for union employees. These increases were mitigated by higher pension income and the absence of the $49 million incurred in 1999 for the Special Work Incentive Program (SWIP) for union employees in the third quarter of 1999. Pension income was higher in 2000 largely due to the transfer of assets from the Conrail pension plan after the Closing Date. NS has substantial unrecognized gains related to its overfunded pension plan; amortization of these gains will continue to be included in "Compensation and benefits" expenses (see Note 11 on Page 68). The Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll taxes. The phase in calls for a reduction from 16.1% in 2001 to 15.6% in 2002, 14.2% in 2003 and 13.1% in 2004. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated. These changes are expected to result in a $21 million reduction to payroll tax expenses in 2002. The new law allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four year reserve or exceed a six year reserve. 36 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Materials, services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses decreased slightly in 2001, but increased 13% in 2000. In 2001, the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services, including expenses for software, consulting and legal fees. The increase in 2000 was mostly attributable to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the consolidation of TCS and was mitigated by the absence of significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 11% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases. The 2000 increase was principally due to the effects of a full year of expanded operations but was mitigated by a favorable comparison for the last seven months, as expenses in 1999 were high due to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Locomotive and equipment repair costs increased in 2001, principally due to renewed maintenance activity. This trend is expected to continue in 2002, driven by higher expenses for freight car repairs. In 2000, maintenance costs increased, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations; however, the increase was tempered by reduced maintenance activities, a result of cost control efforts. Conrail rents and services, a new category of expense beginning in 1999, arose from the expansion of operations on the Closing Date and amounted to $421 million in 2001, $478 million in 2000 and $311 million in 1999. This item includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRCs operation of the Shared Assets Areas. Also included is NS equity in Conrails net earnings since the Closing Date, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between NS investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2 on Page 58). The decline in 2001 reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see "Conrails Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity," below). Expenses in 2000 included a full year of operations over Conrails lines, compared with seven months in 1999. Depreciation expense was up 2% in 2001 and 6% in 2000. Increases in both years were due to property additions, reflecting substantial levels of capital spending (see Note 1, "Properties," on Page 57 for NS depreciation policy). A periodic review of depreciation rates is being finalized, and rates are expected to be somewhat lower. 37 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Diesel fuel expenses decreased 14% in 2001, but increased 87% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in 2001 include $8 million related to the hedging program initiated in the second quarter (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note 16 on Page 77). The increase in 2000 expenses resulted from a 61% rise in the average price per gallon and higher consumption that reflected a full year of Northern Region operations. Casualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased slightly in 2001 and 3% in 2000. The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2001, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 31% of the total employee injury cases settled and 15% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, promotes an adversarial claims environment and produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent. The railroads have been unsuccessful so far in efforts to persuade Congress to replace FELA with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2001, but increased 14% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to lower bad debt costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee relocation expenses. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and higher bad debt expense. Other Income Net Other income net was $99 million in 2001, $168 million in 2000 and $115 million in 1999 (see Note 3 on Page 61). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of certain timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests. This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December. The increase in 2000 reflected the $101 million of gains, mitigated by the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). 38 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2001 was $191 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 31% in 2000 and 32% in 1999. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2001 and 34% in both 2000 and 1999. The effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, both 2000 and 1999 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in 1981. In January 2001, NS received payment from the third party in accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $654 million in 2001, compared with $1.3 billion in 2000 and $533 million in 1999. Results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). Excluding the infusion of cash from this program, operating cash flow declined $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." In 2001, NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $250 million. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital, including an improvement in collection of accounts receivable, a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of bonus payments. The large changes in "Accounts receivable" and "Current liabilities other than debt" in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from the commencement of operations in the Northern Region. In addition, collection of accounts receivable had slowed. NS working capital deficit was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2000. The increase resulted principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. Part of the working capital deficit at Dec. 31, 2001, arises from a $373 million balance in "Notes and accounts payable to Conrail" that is not expected to be repaid in 2002. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part II, Item 7, "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on Page 44 under the heading "Market Risks and Hedging Activities." 49 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Materials, services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses decreased slightly in 2001, but increased 13% in 2000. In 2001, the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services, including expenses for software, consulting and legal fees. The increase in 2000 was mostly attributable to the effects of a full year of Northern Region operations and the consolidation of TCS and was mitigated by the absence of significant costs incurred in 1999 related to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 11% in 2001, but increased 22% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases. The 2000 increase was principally due to the effects of a full year of expanded operations but was mitigated by a favorable comparison for the last seven months, as expenses in 1999 were high due to the service issues encountered after the Closing Date. Locomotive and equipment repair costs increased in 2001, principally due to renewed maintenance activity. This trend is expected to continue in 2002, driven by higher expenses for freight car repairs. In 2000, maintenance costs increased, reflecting a full year of Northern Region operations; however, the increase was tempered by reduced maintenance activities, a result of cost control efforts. Conrail rents and services, a new category of expense beginning in 1999, arose from the expansion of operations on the Closing Date and amounted to $421 million in 2001, $478 million in 2000 and $311 million in 1999. This item includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRCs operation of the Shared Assets Areas. Also included is NS equity in Conrails net earnings since the Closing Date, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between NS investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2 on Page 58). The decline in 2001 reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see "Conrails Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity," below). Expenses in 2000 included a full year of operations over Conrails lines, compared with seven months in 1999. Depreciation expense was up 2% in 2001 and 6% in 2000. Increases in both years were due to property additions, reflecting substantial levels of capital spending (see Note 1, "Properties," on Page 57 for NS depreciation policy). A periodic review of depreciation rates is being finalized, and rates are expected to be somewhat lower. 37 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Diesel fuel expenses decreased 14% in 2001, but increased 87% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in 2001 include $8 million related to the hedging program initiated in the second quarter (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note 16 on Page 77). The increase in 2000 expenses resulted from a 61% rise in the average price per gallon and higher consumption that reflected a full year of Northern Region operations. Casualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased slightly in 2001 and 3% in 2000. The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2001, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 31% of the total employee injury cases settled and 15% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, promotes an adversarial claims environment and produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent. The railroads have been unsuccessful so far in efforts to persuade Congress to replace FELA with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2001, but increased 14% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to lower bad debt costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee relocation expenses. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and higher bad debt expense. Other Income Net Other income net was $99 million in 2001, $168 million in 2000 and $115 million in 1999 (see Note 3 on Page 61). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of certain timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests. This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December. The increase in 2000 reflected the $101 million of gains, mitigated by the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). 38 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2001 was $191 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 31% in 2000 and 32% in 1999. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2001 and 34% in both 2000 and 1999. The effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, both 2000 and 1999 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in 1981. In January 2001, NS received payment from the third party in accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $654 million in 2001, compared with $1.3 billion in 2000 and $533 million in 1999. Results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). Excluding the infusion of cash from this program, operating cash flow declined $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." In 2001, NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $250 million. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital, including an improvement in collection of accounts receivable, a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of bonus payments. The large changes in "Accounts receivable" and "Current liabilities other than debt" in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from the commencement of operations in the Northern Region. In addition, collection of accounts receivable had slowed. NS working capital deficit was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2000. The increase resulted principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. Part of the working capital deficit at Dec. 31, 2001, arises from a $373 million balance in "Notes and accounts payable to Conrail" that is not expected to be repaid in 2002. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part II, Item 7, "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on Page 44 under the heading "Market Risks and Hedging Activities." 49 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Diesel fuel expenses decreased 14% in 2001, but increased 87% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in 2001 include $8 million related to the hedging program initiated in the second quarter (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note 16 on Page 77). The increase in 2000 expenses resulted from a 61% rise in the average price per gallon and higher consumption that reflected a full year of Northern Region operations. Casualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased slightly in 2001 and 3% in 2000. The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2001, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 31% of the total employee injury cases settled and 15% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, promotes an adversarial claims environment and produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent. The railroads have been unsuccessful so far in efforts to persuade Congress to replace FELA with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2001, but increased 14% in 2000. The decline in 2001 was principally due to lower bad debt costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee relocation expenses. The increase in 2000 reflected a full year of Northern Region operations and higher bad debt expense. Other Income Net Other income net was $99 million in 2001, $168 million in 2000 and $115 million in 1999 (see Note 3 on Page 61). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of certain timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests. This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December. The increase in 2000 reflected the $101 million of gains, mitigated by the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). 38 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2001 was $191 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 31% in 2000 and 32% in 1999. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2001 and 34% in both 2000 and 1999. The effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, both 2000 and 1999 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in 1981. In January 2001, NS received payment from the third party in accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $654 million in 2001, compared with $1.3 billion in 2000 and $533 million in 1999. Results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). Excluding the infusion of cash from this program, operating cash flow declined $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." In 2001, NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $250 million. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital, including an improvement in collection of accounts receivable, a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of bonus payments. The large changes in "Accounts receivable" and "Current liabilities other than debt" in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from the commencement of operations in the Northern Region. In addition, collection of accounts receivable had slowed. NS working capital deficit was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2000. The increase resulted principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. Part of the working capital deficit at Dec. 31, 2001, arises from a $373 million balance in "Notes and accounts payable to Conrail" that is not expected to be repaid in 2002. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part II, Item 7, "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on Page 44 under the heading "Market Risks and Hedging Activities." 49 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2001 was $191 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 31% in 2000 and 32% in 1999. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2001 and 34% in both 2000 and 1999. The effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, both 2000 and 1999 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in 1981. In January 2001, NS received payment from the third party in accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17 on Page 79). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $654 million in 2001, compared with $1.3 billion in 2000 and $533 million in 1999. Results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis (see Note 5 on Page 63). Excluding the infusion of cash from this program, operating cash flow declined $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." In 2001, NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $250 million. The improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital, including an improvement in collection of accounts receivable, a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of bonus payments. The large changes in "Accounts receivable" and "Current liabilities other than debt" in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from the commencement of operations in the Northern Region. In addition, collection of accounts receivable had slowed. NS working capital deficit was $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2000. The increase resulted principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. Part of the working capital deficit at Dec. 31, 2001, arises from a $373 million balance in "Notes and accounts payable to Conrail" that is not expected to be repaid in 2002. 39 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2001, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $345 million to $468 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $300 million to $402 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8 on Page 65); however, any reduction in its credit rating could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2002 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. NS contractual obligations related to its long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases and agreements with CRC are as follows: 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,632 $ 605 $ 705 $ 706 $ 5,616 Operating leases 890 113 172 117 488 Agreements with CRC 775 27 62 68 618 Total $ 9,297 $ 745 $ 939 $ 891 $ 6,722 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2 on Page 58. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. 2003 2005 2007 and ($ in millions) Total 2002 2004 2006 Subsequent Long term debt and capital leases $ 705 $ 35 $ 62 $ 48 $ 560 Operating leases 369 36 61 64 208 Total $ 1,074 $ 71 $ 123 $ 112 $ 768 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5 on Page 63) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9 on Page 67). 40 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers. The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision. Cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001, but decreased slightly in 2000. Property additions were up 2% in 2001, following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of significant locomotive purchases, as fleet additions were accomplished by operating lease. Investing activities in 1999 included approximately $140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance than in 2000. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($ in millions) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Road $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 $ 599 Equipment 233 146 349 442 306 Other property 8 28 4 6 24 Total $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $1,060 $ 929 Capital expenditures increased 2% in 2001, but decreased 20% in 2000. Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. The decline in 2000 reflected lower capital expenditures for locomotives as a result of the operating lease. In both years, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure that is expected to be completed in 2002 (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below). 41 Item 7.

The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The information required by this item is included in Part II, Item 7, "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on Page 44 under the heading "Market Risks and Hedging Activities." 49 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) TRACK STRUCTURE STATISTICS (CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Track miles of rail installed 254 390 403 429 451 Miles of track surfaced 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 4,703 New crossties installed (millions) 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 2.2 AVERAGE AGE OF OWNED RAILWAY EQUIPMENT (Years) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 Freight cars 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 23.0 Locomotives 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 15.3 Retired locomotives 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 23.3 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2 on Page 58), which comprises 16% of the freight car fleet and 27% of the locomotive fleet. The higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic. The 1998 decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older units in anticipation of the Closing Date. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. For 2002, NS has budgeted $705 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects, of which $366 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. NS issued in February 2002 debt secured by the locomotives. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $151 million, and reflects the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities included loan transactions with a PRR subsidiary that resulted in net borrowings of $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The substantial net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to Conrail) at year end was 55.6% in 2001 and 56.7% in 2000. NS currently has in place a new $1 billion, five year credit facility, which replaced the facility that would have expired in May 2002. The new agreement provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants similar to the old 42 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) facility (see Note 8 on Page 65). In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand 47 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

In addition, NS has issued only $250 million of debt under its $1 billion shelf registration that became effective in April 2001. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Through May 31, 1999, Conrails results of operations include freight line haul revenues and related expenses. After the Closing Date, June 1, 1999, its results reflect its new structure and operations (see Note 2 on Page 58). Currently, Conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees and rents from NSR and CSXT. The composition of Conrails operating expenses also changed. Conrails net income was $174 million in 2001, compared with $170 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999 (see Note 2 on Page 58). Results in 1999 included $180 million of expenses ($121 million after taxes), principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based on an actuarial valuation, to adjust certain litigation and environmental liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by CSX. Excluding the effects of these items, net income would have been $147 million in 1999. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. The 2000 increase reflected a $37 million after tax gain from a property sale and the absence of significant transition related expenses. Conrails operating revenues were $903 million in 2001, $985 million in 2000 and $2.2 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 resulted from lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary, the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2000 was attributable to the change in operations. Conrails operating expenses were $639 million in 2001, $749 million in 2000 and $2.0 billion in 1999. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. The decrease in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence of the $180 million of expenses discussed above and $60 million of transition related expenses (principally technology integration costs and employee stay bonuses). Conrails cash provided by operations increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001, but decreased $34 million, or 9%, in 2000. The 2001 increase was principally due to a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. The 2000 reduction reflected the change in operations and payment of one time items owed to NSR and CSXT. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $61 million in 2001 and $318 million in 2000. Capital expenditures totaled $47 million in 2001 and $220 million in 2000. Conrail had working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, compared with $85 million at Dec. 31, 2000, including $687 million and $323 million, respectively, of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, 43 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999. NS other comprehensive loss for 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity on Page 55, included $41 million for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13 on Page 74). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), is codeveloping fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has recently experienced a severe downturn. During the second quarter, one of T Cubeds codevelopers filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. This codeveloper owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on joint projects; however, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that such amounts ultimately will be realized. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. Management expects to prevail in this litigation. The ability to collect a judgment against the codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC, may be limited due to its declining financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." To date, based on the known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and, accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6 on Page 63). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of NSR employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. One labor organization has initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants. Management believes, based on known facts and circumstances, including the availability of legal defenses, that the amount of liability for these claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter. Labor Agreements Approximately 85 percent of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements 44 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $44 million in 2001, $21 million in 2000 and $17 million in 1999.

The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation.

A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7.

The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely. Forward Looking Statements This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results. Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, which represents about 4,400 NS employees, and with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which represents about 5,000 NS employees. In addition, a tentative national agreement (subject to ratification) has been reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents about 7,000 NS employees. The tentative national agreement reached with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 1,000 NS employees, was not ratified. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS operating expenses for 2001. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2001, through swap transactions and advance purchases, NS has hedged approximately 40% of expected 2002 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 70 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase NS liability related to the swaps by approximately $15 million. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. Of NS total debt outstanding (see Note 8 on Page 65), all is fixed rate debt, except for most capital leases, $250 million of notes due in 2003 and $174 million of equipment obligations. As a result, NS debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled $675 million at Dec. 31, 2001. A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $7 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7.1%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2001, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.8%, and the average receive rate was 7.1%. During 2001, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $3 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. 45 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Environmental Matters NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably. Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the balance sheet and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million in 2001, $11 million in 2000 and $12 million in 1999, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be comparable to those in 2001. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001, and $36 million at Dec. 31, 2000 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2001, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $17 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 126 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present and future is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be 46 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (continued) estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncement In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Statement No. 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. Statement No. 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. NS adoption of Statement No. 144, effective Jan. 1, 2002, did not have a material effect on its financial statements. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain competitive in this evolving environment.
