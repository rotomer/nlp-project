Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and the Five Year Financial Review. SUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2002 Compared with 2001 Net income was $460 million in 2002, up $85 million, or 23%. Results in 2001 included a $13 million gain from discontinued operations related to the 1998 sale of NS former motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17). Excluding that gain from 2001s results, net income was up $98 million, or 27%, in 2002. The improvement was primarily the result of a $151 million, or 15%, increase in income from railway operations. Diluted earnings per share were $1.18, up 22%. Excluding the discontinued operations gain, diluted earnings per share increased 26%. 2001 Compared with 2000 Net income in 2001 was $375 million, up 118%. Income from continuing operations, which excludes the $13 million discontinued operations gain, was $362 million, up 110%. Results in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force, which reduced income from continuing operations by $101 million, or 26 cents per diluted share. Excluding these costs, income from continuing operations increased $89 million, or 33%, in 2001. The improvement resulted from higher income from railway operations, which was up $209 million, or 26%, that more than offset lower nonoperating income, which was down $69 million (see Note 3). Diluted earnings per share were 97 cents, up 116%. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 94 cents, up 109%. Excluding the work force reduction costs in 2000, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 32%. DETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Railway Operating Revenues Railway operating revenues were $6.3 billion in 2002, and $6.2 billion in both 2001 and 2000. The following table presents a three year comparison of revenues by market group. K16 Revenues by Market Group 2002 2001 2000 ($ in millions) Coal $ 1,441 $ 1,521 $ 1,435 General merchandise: Automotive 961 885 921 Chemicals 769 752 756 Metals/construction 692 674 689 Agriculture/consumer products/ government 623 603 609 Paper/clay/forest 603 612 630 General merchandise  3,648  3,526  3,605 Intermodal 1,181 1,123 1,119 Total $ 6,270 $ 6,170 $ 6,159 In 2002, revenues increased 2%, as a 3% rise in general merchandise revenues coupled with a 5% improvement in intermodal revenues offset a 5% decline in coal revenues. All but one of the general merchandise market groups (paper, clay and forest products) posted increases over 2001. As shown in the following table, most of the revenue improvement was the result of higher traffic volumes. The favorable revenue per unit/mix variance was driven by higher average revenue per unit, offset in part by the effects of unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic. Revenue Variance Analysis Increases (Decreases) 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 ($ in millions) Volume $ 89 $ (200) Revenue per unit/mix 11 211 Total $ 100 $ 11 In 2001, revenues fell for all the general merchandise market groups. However, a 6% increase in coal revenues offset the effects of the lower general merchandise revenues. Revenue per unit increased in all market groups, principally due to rate increases, use of higher capacity equipment and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. COAL tonnage decreased 4% in 2002 and revenues declined 5%. Revenue per unit declined slightly, reflecting unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic (more shorter haul business) that offset the effects of rate increases and gains in tonnage per car. Coal, coke and iron ore represented 23% of total railway operating revenues in 2002, and 84% of NS coal shipments originated on lines it operates. In 2001, coal tonnage increased 2%, and revenues improved 6%. Revenue per unit increased 6%, a result of rate increases, including lower volume related refunds on export coal shipments, gains in tonnage per car and favorable changes in the mix of traffic (less shorter haul business). K17 Total Coal, Coke and Iron Ore Tonnage 2002 2001 2000 (In millions of tons) Utility 128 133 119 Export 11 14 20 Domestic metallurgical 21 20 25 Other 10 11 11 Total 170 178 175 Utility coal tonnage decreased 3% in 2002, a result of lower demand that reflected the weak economy, high coal stockpile levels entering the year, mild temperatures in the first quarter, reduced stockpile targets set by utility companies and increased generation from new natural gas fired plants. Licensing requirements for these new plants resulted in additional generation that temporarily displaced coal fired generation. In 2001, utility coal traffic increased 11%, reflecting higher demand for coal fired electricity and the effects of very high natural gas prices early in the year. High demand for coal, a volatile market for natural gas and production problems at a number of large mines in the East late in 2000 combined to increase demand somewhat early in 2001 with a resulting increase in coal prices. Utility coal traffic volume also benefited somewhat from the shifting of coal that traditionally would have been bound for export to the domestic market. Two of NS utility customers, Duke Energy (Duke) and Carolina Power and Light (CP&L), have filed rate reasonableness complaints at the Surface Transportation Board (STB) alleging that the NS tariff rates for the transportation of coal to their solely served power plants are unreasonable. NS is disputing these allegations. Since January 1, 2002, in the case of Duke and since April 1, 2002, in the case of CP&L, NS has been billing and collecting amounts from the customers based on the challenged tariff rates. Management expects that the resolution of these cases, which is anticipated to occur in 2003, will not have a material effect on NS financial statements. The near term outlook for utility coal remains positive. Coal fired generation remains the lowest cost marginal source of electricity. Coal plant generation should continue to track the U.S. economy, and management expects that utilities will use coal fired plants to meet increased demand because of coals low cost. As always, demand will be influenced by the weather. In addition, while the price of natural gas can affect demand for utility coal, its higher price and volatility may improve the long term competitive position of coal fired generation. Phase II of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which imposed more stringent limits on sulfur dioxide emissions, took effect on Jan. 1, 2000. Many of the mines served by NS produce coals that satisfy Phase II requirements. In addition, substantial banks of sulfur dioxide allowances held by many NS served utilities, as well as implementation of sulfur dioxide emission control systems at many NS served plants, should continue to provide a market for other NS served mines. While the Phase II impact on NS utility coal has been minimal, there are a number of other evolving environmental issues that have the potential to increase or ease cost pressures on the utility coal market, depending upon their outcome. These include a potential new national energy policy, proposed multi pollutant legislation, a proposed new rule concerning "new source review," the impending mercury emissions standard and the fate of U.S. participation in the Kyoto Protocol. K18 Although impending developments with these environmental issues could potentially increase cost pressures on coal fired generation, the outlook remains positive for maintaining coals position in the power generation mix for regions served by NS. However, different developments with these issues could actually ease cost pressures on coal fired generation, further strengthening coals position. The 1999 decision by a federal district court judge in West Virginia holding that some common mountaintop mining practices in the coal industry are illegal was overturned in April 2001 by the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In January 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the case. In May 2002, the same district court judge made a similar ruling in a different case in which NS had again intervened. In January 2003, this ruling also was overturned by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Export coal tonnage declined 18% in 2002. Steam coal exports through Baltimore declined 4%, and export metallurgical coals through Norfolk declined 22%. During the first half of 2002, demand for U.S. coal was soft as international buyers focused their purchases toward other, lower priced sources. Market uncertainty resulted in late contract settlements and delayed shipments. Late in 2002, demand for U.S. coking coals increased, reflecting a shift in the market as exports from China, Australia and Poland declined. As a result, shipments through Norfolk increased in the fourth quarter. In 2001, export coal tonnage decreased 30%. The rapid rise of domestic utility coal prices early in the year enticed many foreign market suppliers to place much of their 2001 production in the domestic utility markets. In addition, production difficulties at several large NS served mines and flooding in West Virginia in July significantly reduced the supply of low volatility coal. The combination of these factors resulted in most of the decline in shipments of export coal. Steam coal exports through Baltimore declined 32%, and export metallurgical coals through Norfolk declined by 30%. Demand for steam coal to export strengthened in the last half of 2001; however, strong U.S. demand limited NS participation in this market. Demand for coking coal to export continued to soften, as steel production moved from traditional NS markets in Europe to Asia, which in recent years has been supplied by Australian or Canadian coals. It is expected that export coal tonnage will continue to be limited by supply and subject to the fluctuations of the world market. The increase in demand for U.S. coals seen in the fourth quarter of 2002 has continued into the first quarter of 2003, and early indications are that these market forces should remain in place as contracts are settled in the spring for the coming year. Should these market forces continue, U.S. coal export volumes could recover somewhat. However, the inherent volatility and uncertainties in this market make predictions especially vulnerable. Domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore tonnage increased 5% in 2002, reflecting higher U.S. steel production that was aided by the imported steel tariff program implemented in 2002. In addition, continued strong vehicle production resulted in demand for steel. In 2001, domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore tonnage decreased 18% due to a decline in the market for domestic steel. The softening economy and an increase in steel imports drastically cut blast furnace production, sharply reducing the demand for coking coal, iron ore and coke. The increase in imported steel also resulted in lower prices that put pressure on the U.S. steel industry and led to plant closures and bankruptcies that included some NS customers. Domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore traffic is expected to continue to experience modest gains during the two year life of the import tariffs. However, long term demand is expected to decline, reflecting advanced technologies that allow production of steel using less coke. K19 Other coal tonnage, principally steam coal shipped to manufacturing plants, decreased 14% in 2002, but increased 6% in 2001. The decline in 2002 was primarily the result of the weak economy. The gain in 2001 resulted from new and increased business from industrial customers. GENERAL MERCHANDISE traffic volume (carloads) increased 2% in 2002, and revenues increased 3%, principally due to a 9% improvement in automotive revenues. In 2001, traffic volume decreased 7%, and revenues decreased 2%, reflecting the effects of a weak economy. Automotive traffic volume increased 7%, and revenues increased 9% in 2002, principally due to a rise in vehicle production and new business. Revenue per unit increased 2%, reflecting some pricing improvements, extended length of haul, special ancillary services and the settlement of a disputed charge. In 2001, automotive traffic volume decreased 10%, and revenues declined 4%, principally due to a 10% drop in vehicle production. Revenue per unit increased 7%, principally due to rate increases, efficiencies gained from the redesign of the mixing center network and use of higher capacity equipment. Automotive revenues in 2003 are expected to be lower than those of 2002. Light vehicle production is predicted to be down slightly, and NS largest automotive customer has announced a 5% decrease in first quarter 2003 production. Chemicals traffic volume increased slightly, and revenues increased 2% in 2002. Higher traffic volume for plastics and a small increase for miscellaneous chemicals offset a decline for petroleum products. Demand for plastics was supported by increases in light vehicle production and housing starts. Traffic volume also benefited from increased shipments through NS Thoroughbred Bulk Transfer (TBT) facilities that handle chemicals and bulk commodities for customers not located on NS served lines. Revenue per unit increased as a result of a favorable change in the mix of traffic (more higher rated business) and market driven rate increases. In 2001, chemicals traffic volume decreased 5%, and revenues decreased 1%. The weak economy depressed shipments of petroleum, plastics, industrial and miscellaneous chemicals. These declines were partially offset by new business through NS TBT facilities. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and a favorable change in the mix of traffic (more longer haul moves). Chemicals revenues are expected to improve in 2003, supported by a recovering economy, new business and improved revenue per unit. Metals and construction traffic volume increased 2%, and revenues improved 3% in 2002, reflecting improvement in the steel industry, which was aided by the two year imported steel tariff program implemented in 2002. Metals volume benefited from resumption of production at some mills that closed in 2001 and increased volume from new mills. Construction traffic declined, primarily as a result of reductions in highway projects due to state government budget pressures. In 2001, metals and construction traffic volume decreased 7%, and revenues declined 2%, reflecting weakness in the steel and construction industries. The steel industry recession, which began in 2000, resulted in excess capacity and the closing of numerous steel mills. Revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. Metals and construction revenues are expected to continue to benefit from added production along NS lines, although further consolidation in the steel industry is expected. Construction markets may benefit from new business from stone quarries and cement terminals in the Southeast. Agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume decreased slightly in 2002, but revenues increased 3%. Traffic volume increases for corn, food products and beverages largely offset declines for soybeans and feed. Corn volume benefited from increased shipments from the Midwest to K20 drought stricken areas in the East. The increase for food products was primarily the result of new business. Soybean and feed volumes were adversely affected by lower domestic and export demand. Revenue per unit increased because of higher rates, increased length of haul and favorable changes in the mix of traffic. In 2001, agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume decreased 3%, and revenues declined 1%, primarily due to reduced shipments of fertilizer. This decline was due to soft farm demand, record high natural gas prices early in the year (which curtailed production of certain fertilizers) and increased imports. This was mitigated by traffic volume increases for grain, flour and canned goods. The revenue per unit increase was primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of traffic. Agriculture, consumer products and government revenues in 2003 are expected to continue to benefit from higher corn, fertilizer and food product volume. Fertilizer volumes may be favorably affected by the reopening of a large phosphate fertilizer plant. Paper, clay and forest products traffic volume declined 3%, and revenues decreased 1%, in 2002, primarily due to continued weakness in the paper market, especially in the first half of the year. Traffic volume improved later in the year as the paper market strengthened. In addition, NS gained business from conversion of truck shipments to rail and from continued strength in housing starts. Revenue per unit benefited from rate increases and a decline in shorter haul business. In 2001, paper, clay and forest products traffic volume declined 8%, and revenues decreased 3%, primarily due to a weakened paper market. Paper shipments were adversely affected by reduced production at many NS served paper mills, a result of sluggish newspaper advertising and soft demand for paper. Lumber traffic began the year weak, improved in late summer, but softened late in the year due to short term weakness in housing starts. Revenue per unit increased principally due to higher rates. Paper, clay and forest products revenues are expected to improve slightly in 2003 as a result of a recovering economy, service improvements and new business. INTERMODAL traffic volume increased 6%, and revenues increased 5%, in 2002. Volume growth was principally the result of new and improved services that resulted in new business, including the conversion of truck business to rail. International traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, increased 10%, supported by growth in trade activity and new business, including the conversion of over the road traffic. Domestic shipments grew 6%, primarily because of new business gained from the conversion of truck shipments. Triple Crown Services Company (TCS) volume increased 4%. Revenue per unit declined as a result of an increase in shorter haul business and the absence of fuel surcharges that were in place in 2001, which were partially offset by some rate increases. In 2001, intermodal traffic volume decreased 1%, but revenues increased slightly. Domestic traffic volume was up in the first half of the year, but demand increasingly weakened as the year progressed, which eroded NS base of traffic. New business supported by the opening of three new terminals and other initiatives mitigated the effects of the weakened economy. International traffic grew slightly as U.S. imports slowed with the economy. TCS traffic volume increased 1% despite economic conditions, as it continued to provide reliable, trucklike service. Intermodal revenue per unit dropped later in the year, reflecting the expiration of fuel surcharges that were implemented late in 2000 and the introduction of new shorter haul business. In 2003, intermodal revenues are expected to continue to benefit from new business supported by continued improvements in service and conversion of truck traffic to rail. K21 Railway Operating Expenses Railway operating expenses decreased 1% in 2002, while carloads increased 1%. In 2001, railway operating expenses declined 7%. However, expenses in 2000 included $165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force. Excluding these costs, railway operating expenses decreased 4% in 2001, while carloads dropped 3%. The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, was 81.5% in 2002, compared with 83.7% in 2001 and 87% in 2000 (excluding the work force reduction costs, which increased the ratio 2.7 percentage points). Both declines primarily resulted from gains in efficiency, although 2002 also benefited from higher traffic volume, and 2001 benefited from increased revenue per unit. The efficiency gains in 2002 were principally the result of the implementation of a new operating plan that emphasizes adherence to a schedule and reductions in service variability. These improvements came despite a continuing change in the mix of traffic (more resource intensive traffic, such as automotive and intermodal, coupled with the decrease in export coal traffic). The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications. Operating Expense Variances Increases (Decreases) 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 ($ in millions) Compensation and benefits* $ 8 $ (220) Materials, services and rents 13 (1) Conrail rents and services (9) (57) Depreciation 1 11 Diesel fuel (70) (66) Casualties and other claims 28 1 Other (22) (31) Total $ (51) $ (363) * Includes $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Compensation and benefits represented 40% of total railway operating expenses and increased slightly in 2002. Higher wage rates, reduced pension income (see Note 11) and increased health and welfare benefits costs more than offset savings from reduced employment levels and lower payroll taxes (see the discussion of the Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act, below). Medical costs are expected to continue to increase in 2003, a result of higher costs for active employees and an increase in the expected inflation related to postretirement benefits. In 2001, compensation and benefits decreased 10%; however, this comparison reflects the $165 million of work force reduction costs in 2000. Excluding those costs, compensation and benefits decreased 3%, primarily a result of savings attributable to the reduced size of the work force, which were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees, higher incentive compensation and reduced pension income. The Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll taxes. The phase in calls for a reduction from 15.6% in 2002 to 14.2% in 2003 and 13.1% in 2004. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated. These changes resulted in an estimated $21 million reduction in payroll taxes in 2002 and are expected to result in savings of $20 million in 2003, compared with 2002. However, these K22 savings are expected to be offset by an increase in the railroad unemployment tax rate, higher payroll taxes on increased wages and a higher wage base. The new law allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of future Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four year reserve or exceed a six year reserve. Materials, services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses increased 1% in 2002 and decreased slightly in 2001. The increase in 2002 was the result of higher volume related expenses for automotive and intermodal traffic, increased material costs for locomotives, higher expenses for roadway and bridge repairs and increased derailment costs. These higher costs were largely offset by a significant reduction in equipment rents. In 2001, the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services, including expenses for software, consulting and legal fees. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 14% in 2002 and 11% in 2001. The decline in 2002 was principally the result of continued improvement in cycle times, reflecting efficiency gains and, for intermodal equipment, service design and process changes implemented during the year. The decrease in 2001 was primarily due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases. Locomotive repair costs increased in 2002 and 2001, principally due to renewed maintenance activity, which is expected to continue into 2003. Freight car maintenance costs, which were relatively flat in 2002, are also likely to increase in 2003, as it is expected that the economy will recover and more freight cars are due for maintenance. Conrail rents and services decreased 2% in 2002 and 12% in 2001. This item includes amounts due to PRR and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRCs operation of the Shared Assets Areas. Also included is NS equity in Conrails net earnings, plus the additional amortization related to the difference between NS investment in Conrail and its underlying equity (see Note 2). Both declines reflected higher Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see "Conrails Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity," below). Depreciation expense was up slightly in 2002 and increased 2% in 2001. Substantial levels of capital spending affected both years; however, depreciation expense in 2002 benefited from lower rates implemented early in the year following completion of a periodic study (see Note 1, "Properties," for NS depreciation policy). Diesel fuel expenses decreased 17% in 2002 and 14% in 2001. The decline in 2002 reflected a 16% drop in the average price per gallon and slightly lower consumption. Expenses in 2002 included a $10 million benefit from the hedging program initiated in the second quarter of 2001 (see "Market Risks and Hedging Activities," below and Note 16). The decrease in 2001 was the result of an 8% drop in consumption and a 7% decline in the average price per gallon. Expenses in 2001 included $8 million of cost related to the hedging program. NS expects diesel fuel prices to be higher in 2003. Casualties and other claims expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased 20% in 2002, but only slightly in 2001. The increase in 2002 reflected adverse personal injury claims development as indicated by an actuarial study and higher expenses for loss and damage to lading, as well as higher insurance and environmental remediation costs. K23 The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. In 2002, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 30% of the total employee injury cases settled and 24% of the total settlement payments made. Injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event, but, rather, result from a claimed exposure over time. Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no fault workers compensation system. NS, like many other businesses in the U.S., has experienced difficulty obtaining property and casualty insurance at reasonable terms since the September 11 terrorist attacks. Thus far, NS has been successful in maintaining a substantial amount of commercial insurance for third party personal injury, property damage and FELA claims that exceed the self insured retention. However, both the cost of this commercial insurance and the amount of risk that NS retains through self insurance has more than doubled since the attacks. Other expenses decreased 10% in 2002 and 13% in 2001. The decline in 2002 reflected lower expenses for property and sales and use taxes. The decrease in 2001 was principally the result of lower bad debt costs, reduced franchise and property taxes, and lower travel and employee relocation expenses. Other Income &ndash; Net Other income &ndash; net was $66 million in 2002, $99 million in 2001 and $168 million in 2000 (see Note 3). The decline in 2002 was primarily the result of higher interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities, lower gains from the sale of properties and investments, and the absence of a $13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement that benefited 2001. These reductions were partially offset by reduced discount from the sales of receivables (due to a lower amount of receivables sold and a lower interest rate environment, which favorably affects the amount of discount). The reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of $101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests. This was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and the $13 million nonrecurring settlement gain. Results in 2001 also included an $18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in December. Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2002 was $246 million for an effective rate of 35%, compared with effective rates of 35% in 2001 and 31% in 2000. Excluding the equity in Conrails after tax earnings, the effective rates were 38% in 2002 and 2001 and 34% in 2000. The effective rates in 2002 and 2001 were higher than that of 2000, primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coal seam gas properties. The effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities. In addition, 2000 benefited from investments in coal seam gas properties. The 2003 effective rate may benefit from the resolution of various tax audits. In March 2002, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 was signed into law and began providing immediate tax incentives for business. A 30% additional first year depreciation allowance was a primary element of this legislation. This depreciation incentive continues for three years, and during these years the resulting acceleration of tax depreciation deductions will improve cash flow by reducing current tax expense and increasing deferred tax expense by significant amounts. K24 Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations in 2001 consisted of a $13 million after tax gain related to the sale of NS motor carrier subsidiary (see Note 17). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $803 million in 2002, compared with $654 million in 2001 and $1.3 billion in 2000. In 2002, the improvement was the result of higher income from railway operations and favorable changes in working capital, which were offset, in part, by fewer accounts receivable sold (see Note 5). Receivable sales declined $270 million in 2002 and $88 million in 2001. The significant decline in operating cash flow in 2001 reflects the commencement in 2000 of the accounts receivable sales program. Excluding the infusion of cash in 2000 from the start of this program, operating cash flow declined by $300 million in 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from an $88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold, higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years, an increase in telecommunication receivables, bonus payments in 2001 (no such payments in 2000) and the timing of payrolls. A significant portion of payments made to PRR (which are included in "Conrail Rents and Services" and, therefore, are a use of cash in "Cash provided by operating activities") are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are a source of cash in "Proceeds from borrowings." NS net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $212 million in 2002 and $250 million in 2001. NS working capital deficit was $554 million at Dec. 31, 2002, compared with $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2001. The decline resulted principally from the change in the terms of the note under which NS borrows funds from a subsidiary of PRR (see Note 2) and a reduction in the amount of debt due within one year. Debt due in 2003 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable) and cash on hand. NS currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs. During 2002, the amount of receivables NS could sell under this program ranged from $368 million to $421 million, and the amount of receivables NS sold ranged from $30 million to $400 million. Moreover, NS has the capability to issue up to $1 billion of commercial paper (see Note 8); however, reductions in its credit ratings could limit NS ability to access the commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities, below). NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations. This expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2003 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters. K25 Contractual obligations at Dec. 31, 2002, related to NS long term debt (including capital leases), operating leases, agreements with CRC, unconditional purchase obligations and other long term obligations are as follows: 2004 2006 2008 and Total 2003 2005 2007 Subsequent ($ in millions) Long term debt and capital leases $ 7,364 $ 358 $ 856 $ 1,153 $ 4,997 Operating leases 880 113 166 115 486 Agreements with CRC 748 30 65 68 585 Unconditional purchase obligations 164 164 Other long term obligations 38 8 16 14 Total $ 9,194 $ 673 $ 1,103 $ 1,350 $ 6,068 NS also has contractual obligations to PRR as disclosed in Note 2. However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail. As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its contractual obligations. The following table presents 58% of Conrails contractual obligations for long term debt (including capital leases) and operating leases. Conrail has no unconditional purchase or other long term obligations. 2004 2006 2008 and Total 2003 2005 2007 Subsequent ($ in millions) Long term debt and capital leases $ 684 $ 33 $ 62 $ 62 $ 527 Operating leases 327 32 64 62 169 Total $ 1,011 $ 65 $ 126 $ 124 $ 696 NS also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program (see Note 5) and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives (see Note 9). Under the accounts receivable sale program, NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers. NS has no ownership interest in the buyers. The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt. NS has no obligation related to the buyers debt, and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables. Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and would retain collections related to the previously sold receivables (see Note 5). The operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at NS option and expires in 2008. The lessor is a special purpose entity formed to enter into this transaction, but it is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity. The lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase. NS has no obligation related to the debt. NS has the option to purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor. The return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option. If NS does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value. NS does not expect to be required to make any payments K26 under this provision (see Note 9). As the primary beneficiary of the business of the lessor, effective Jan. 1, 2003, NS consolidated the assets (locomotives) and liabilities (debt) of this special purpose entity when it implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (see "New Accounting Pronouncement" on page K34). Cash used for investing activities increased 12% in 2002 and 3% in 2001. Property additions, which account for most of the recurring spending in this category, were down 8% in 2002, following a 2% increase in 2001. Property sales were significantly lower in 2002, which resulted in the net increase in cash used for investing activities despite the reduction in capital spending. The following tables show capital spending (including capital leases) and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. Capital Expenditures 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 ($ in millions) Road $ 519 $ 505 $ 557 $ 559 $ 612 Equipment 174 233 146 349 442 Other property 2 8 28 4 6 Total $ 695 $ 746 $ 731 $ 912 $ 1,060 Capital expenditures (which in 2002 included $6 million of capitalized leases) decreased 7% in 2002, but increased 2% in 2001. The decline in 2002 reflected lower spending for intermodal facilities, as NS completed in 2001 several significant projects that expanded the capacity of the intermodal network. Higher spending on track program work was offset by fewer locomotive purchases (50 in 2002 compared with 100 in 2001). Outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases (no such purchases were made in 2000 as locomotives were leased) that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, spending for road included fiber optic infrastructure (see "Telecommunications Subsidiary," below).  Track Structure Statistics (Capital and Maintenance) 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Track miles of rail installed 235 254 390 403 429 Miles of track surfaced 5,270 3,836 3,687 5,087 4,715 New crossties installed (millions) 2.8 1.5 1.5 2.3 2.0 Average Age of Owned Railway Equipment 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 (years) Freight cars 25.9 25.4 24.6 23.8 23.6 Locomotives 16.1 15.7 16.1 15.4 15.4 Retired locomotives 28.2 22.4 24.5 22.7 20.6 The table above excludes equipment leased from PRR (see Note 2), which comprises 17% of the freight car fleet and 25% of the locomotive fleet. Through its coal car rebody program, which was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above. K27 For 2003, NS has budgeted $798 million for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $499 million for roadway projects, of which $383 million is for track and bridge program work. Also included are projects for communications, signal and electrical systems, as well as projects for environmental and public improvements such as grade crossing separations and signal upgrades. Other roadway projects include marketing and industrial development initiatives, including increasing track capacity and access to coal receivers and vehicle production and distribution facilities, and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure. Equipment spending of $246 million includes the purchase of 100 locomotives and upgrades to existing units, improvements to multilevel automobile racks, and projects related to computers and information technology, including additional security and backup systems. Cash used for financing activities in 2002 was $150 million. Financing activities provided cash of $151 million in 2001 and used cash of $798 million in 2000. The comparisons reflect a net reduction of debt in 2002, a net increase in 2001 and a net reduction in 2000. The comparison in 2001 also reflected the effects of the reduction to the dividend in January 2001. Financing activities include loan transactions with a subsidiary of PRR that resulted in net borrowings of $212 million in 2002 and $250 million in 2001 and net repayments of $72 million in 2000 (see Note 2). Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $303 million in 2002, $20 million in 2001 and $422 million in 2000. The net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable. NS debt to total capitalization ratio (excluding notes payable to the PRR subsidiary) at year end was 53.1% in 2002 and 55.6% in 2001. NS currently has in place a $1 billion, five year credit agreement, which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants (see Note 8). NS has outstanding $717 million of its 7.05% notes due May 1, 2037. Each holder of a 2037 note may require NS to redeem all or part of the note at face value, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on May 1, 2004. NS will not know the amount of 2037 notes that it may be required to redeem until April 1, 2004. NS expects to be able to redeem any such notes using cash generated from operations (including sales of accounts receivable), cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require management to change them. Accordingly, management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management discusses the development, selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions (see Note 11). These include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans assets, projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality. In addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value. Management makes these estimates based on the companys historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance). Management engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities. K28 NS net pension benefit, which is included in "Compensation and benefits" on its Consolidated Income Statement, was $79 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2002. In recording this amount, NS assumed a long term investment rate of return of 9%, compared with the 10% rate used in the previous two years. Investment experience of the pension fund over the past 10 , 15 and 20 year periods has been in excess of 10%. A one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $20 million change to the pension credit and, as a result, an equal change in "Compensation and benefits" expense. Changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on NS net pension benefit or net pension asset in the future. The net pension asset is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment; therefore, management has little discretion in this assumption. NS net cost for other postretirement benefits, which is also included in "Compensation and benefits," was $34 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2002. In recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits, which is included in "Other benefits" as disclosed in Note 11, management estimated future increases in health care costs. These assumptions, along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them, are described in Note 11. Properties and Depreciation Most of NS total assets are comprised of long lived railway properties (see Note 6) and its investment in Conrail (see Note 2). Most of Conrails assets are long lived railway properties. As disclosed in Note 1, NS properties are depreciated using group depreciation. Rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured by gross ton miles. Other properties are depreciated generally using the straight line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives. NS reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows or estimated net realizable value. Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value. NS is amortizing the excess of the purchase price paid for its investment in Conrail over its share of Conrails net equity using the principles of purchase accounting, based primarily on the estimated remaining useful lives of Conrails properties. NS depreciation expense is based on managements assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement. These assumptions are the product of periodic depreciation studies that are performed by a firm of consulting engineers. These studies analyze NS historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change in operation or maintenance practices. NS recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties, these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense. The studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property. NS "Depreciation expense" for the year ended Dec. 31, 2002, amounted to $515 million. NS weighted average depreciation rates for 2002 are disclosed in Note 6; a one tenth percentage point increase (or decrease) in these rates would result in a $17 million increase (or decrease) to NS depreciation expense. Personal Injury, Environmental and Legal Liabilities NS expense for "Casualties and other claims" amounted to $171 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2002. Most of this expense was composed of NS accrual related to personal injury liabilities (see discussion of FELA in the discussion captioned "Casualties and other claims" on page K23). NS engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during the year. The actuarial firm studies NS historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements. The actuary also takes into account outside influences considered pertinent. The study uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of the liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims. NS has recorded this actuarially determined liability. The liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting K29 actuary and management in the periodic studies. Accordingly, there could be significant changes in the liability, which NS would recognize when such a change became known. The most recent actuarial study was performed as of June 30, 2002, and resulted in an increase to NS personal injury liability during the third quarter. While the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study, it is reasonably possible that the liability could be higher or lower. NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably (see Note 18). Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $15 million in 2002, $12 million in 2001, and $11 million in 2000, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $10 million in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000. Capital expenditures in 2003 are expected to be comparable to those in 2002. NS balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $29 million at Dec. 31, 2002, and $33 million at Dec. 31, 2001 (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year). At Dec. 31, 2002, the liability represented NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 114 identified locations. On that date, 10 sites accounted for $16 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At some of the 114 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. NS estimates its environmental remediation liability on a site by site basis, using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site. As a result, it is not practical to quantitatively discuss the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments. NS has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities. The risk of incurring environmental liability &ndash; for acts and omissions, past, present and future &ndash; is inherent in the railroad business. Some of the commodities in NS traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others, or held for sale. Because environmental problems may exist on these properties that are latent or undisclosed, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmentally related liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time. Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other now unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. However, based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, management believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which the Corporation is aware. Further, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. K30 Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations. When management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to expenses. While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments, in managements opinion the recorded liability, if any, is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims. However, the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter. Any adjustments to recorded liability will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known. Income Taxes NS net deferred tax liability totaled $3,010 million at Dec. 31, 2002 (see Note 4). This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns. For state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized. NS has only a $24 million valuation allowance on $592 million of deferred tax assets as of Dec. 31, 2002, reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized. For 2002, 2001 and 2000, the effective tax rates, excluding NS equity in Conrails earnings, were 38%, 38% and 34%, respectively. For every 1/2% change in the 2002 effective tax rate, net income would have changed by $4 million. CONRAILS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Conrails net income was $180 million in 2002, compared with $174 million in 2001 and $170 million in 2000 (see Note 2). The increase in 2002 was primarily the result of a favorable federal tax settlement. The improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses, a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in Conrails favor. These positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property. Conrails operating revenues were $893 million in 2002, $903 million in 2001 and $985 million in 2000. Both decreases resulted from the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas. The decline in 2001 also reflected lower revenues at Conrails Indiana Harbor Belt subsidiary. Conrails operating expenses were $623 million in 2002, $639 million in 2001 and $749 million in 2000. The decrease in 2002 reflected lower expenses for materials, services and rents and compensation and benefits, which were offset, in part, by higher costs for casualties and other claims. The decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials, services and rents; casualties and other claims; and compensation and benefits. Conrails cash provided by operations decreased $79 million, or 16%, in 2002, and increased $140 million, or 39%, in 2001. The decline in 2002 was primarily the result of the absence of two items that benefited 2001: a $50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard advertising on Conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement. This was offset, in part, by favorable changes in working capital. The increase in 2001 was largely the result of the two unusual items discussed above. Cash generated from operations is Conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $59 million in 2002 and $61 million in 2001. Capital expenditures totaled $23 million in 2002 and $47 million in 2001. K31 Conrail had a working capital deficit of $29 million at Dec. 31, 2002, compared with working capital of $438 million at Dec. 31, 2001, which included $687 million of amounts receivable from NS and CSX. Conrail is not an SEC registrant and, therefore, presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities. Conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations. NS equity in earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, was $54 million in 2002, $44 million in 2001 and $21 million in 2000. NS other comprehensive loss for 2002 and 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity, included $34 million and $41 million, respectively, for its portion of Conrails other comprehensive loss (see Note 13). OTHER MATTERS Telecommunications Subsidiary NS subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, Inc. (T Cubed), has developed fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry. This industry has experienced a severe downturn. As a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets, T Cubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets, as required by SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." To date, based on known facts and circumstances, management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered, and accordingly, no impairment has been recognized (see Note 6). During 2001, one of T Cubeds codevelopers, 360networks (USA),inc. ("360"), filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and foreign laws. 360 owes T Cubed amounts for work performed on certain joint projects; and T Cubed owes 360 amounts for work performed on other joint projects. The bankruptcy judge has approved set off of these amounts, leaving about $7 million due to T Cubed from 360. T Cubed has the right to collect this amount from any proceeds due 360 from the sale of joint assets. Management believes that it will collect this receivable. T Cubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper, Williams Communications, LLC ("Williams Communications"), concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by T Cubed between Cleveland, Ohio, and northern Virginia. On Jan. 29, 2003, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia entered an order requiring Williams Communications to pay T Cubed the remaining amount due for such infrastructure, approximately $36 million, plus prejudgment interest at a rate of 9% per annum. Williams Communications may elect to appeal. The ability to collect and retain a judgment against Williams Communications may be limited due to its financial condition; however, the shortfall, if any, cannot now be determined. Its parent, Williams Communications Group, Inc., filed in April 2002 a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and emerged from bankruptcy in October 2002. Williams Communications was not included in the bankruptcy petition (see Note 18). Labor Arbitration Several hundred claims have been filed with NSR on behalf of employees furloughed after June 1, 1999, for various periods of time, alleging that the furloughs were a result of the Conrail transaction and seeking "New York Dock" income protection benefits. Several labor organizations have initiated arbitration on behalf of individual employees. Other disputes are pending wherein similar benefits are sought under labor agreement provisions that, in managements judgment, do not apply to the involved circumstances. Based on known facts, including the availability of legal defenses, management believes that NS will prevail in these disputes and that any potential liability for the involved claims should not have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Depending on the outcome of these arbitrations, additional claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration. Should all such claimants prevail, there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter (see Note 18). K32 Labor Agreements Approximately 24,000 of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. Moratorium provisions in these agreements permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999; negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter. The outcome of these negotiations is uncertain at this time. However, agreements have been reached with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes (BMWE), which represents about 4,200 NS employees; the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE), which represents about 4,500 NS employees; the United Transportation Union (UTU), which represents about 6,700 NS employees; the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and Blacksmiths (IBB), which represents about 100 NS employees; and the Transportation Communications International Union (TCU), which represents about 4,400 NS employees. Health and welfare issues have been resolved with BMWE and TCU. The UTU agreement provides that, subsequent to a further period of negotiation, health and welfare issues may be submitted to arbitration. Health and welfare issues with the other organizations have not yet been resolved. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption. The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments. Diesel fuel costs represented 7% of NS operating expenses for 2002. The program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for any month within any 36 month period. As of Dec. 31, 2002, through swap transactions, NS has hedged approximately 62% of expected 2003 diesel fuel requirements. The effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 73 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and transportation. A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would reduce NS asset related to the swaps by approximately $30 million as of Dec. 31, 2002. NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. At Dec. 31, 2002, NS debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $784 million (excluding debt due to the PRR subsidiary). A 1% increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $8 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Some of NS capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On Dec. 31, 2002, the average pay rate under these agreements was 2.1%, and the average receive rate was 7%. During 2002, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by $9 million. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. K33 New Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," (SFAS No. 143) which is effective Jan. 1, 2003, and addresses legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. In accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts for Railroad Companies (see Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49, Subtitle B, Chapter X, Part 1201), NS depreciates track structure (rail, other track material and ties) to its net salvage value (gross salvage less cost to remove). SFAS No. 143 prohibits the accrual of a liability for removal costs absent a legal obligation to remove the related asset. Management believes that there is no such legal obligation to remove track. The SEC staff has recently taken a position with a registrant in another industry that calls into question whether the use of net salvage that results in depreciating more than the cost basis of an asset (negative salvage) is appropriate once SFAS No. 143 becomes effective. NS is in the process of studying its track accounts to determine where current depreciation rates will result in negative salvage. To the extent that NS accumulated depreciation includes such amounts, they will be removed. The cumulative effect of this catch up adjustment will be recorded as a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2003. Going forward, this change will result in lower depreciation expense (because the depreciation rate will no longer reflect any negative salvage) and higher compensation and benefits expenses (for the labor cost to remove retired assets); NS does not expect that this will result in a material change to its total railway operating expenses. The FASB has issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," (FIN No. 46), which addresses consolidation of certain variable interest entities (also commonly referred to as "special purpose entities"). NS adopted FIN No. 46, effective Jan 1, 2003. As a result, on that date NS consolidated a special purpose entity that leases certain locomotives to NS (see Note 9). This entity has no other significant assets or liabilities other than the locomotives and the debt related to their purchase, which will be reflected on NS Consolidated Balance Sheet in 2003. This change in reporting will also have the following effects to NS Consolidated Income Statement beginning in 2003: operating lease expense will decline, and depreciation expense and interest expense on debt will increase. The net effect of these income statement changes is not significant. Adoption of FIN No. 46 did not have a significant effect on NS financial position or liquidity. Inflation Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. Trends Federal Economic Regulation Efforts may be made in 2003 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business. NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation. Utility Deregulation Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties. The effects of deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty; however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers who are expected to remain competitive in this evolving environment. Carbon Based Fuel There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbon based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes. To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policy makers, the impact could be K34 either a reduction in the demand for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coal fired facilities even more difficult. The revenues and net income of NSR and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely.
