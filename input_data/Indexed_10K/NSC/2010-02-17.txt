Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Norfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and the Selected Financial Data.  OVERVIEW While NS results in 2009 reflect the decline of the domestic and global economies, they also demonstrate NS ability to focus on safety, service, asset management, and sustainability all while controlling costs. Revenues decreased $2.7 billion, or 25%, in 2009, as manufacturers reduced production to meet sagging consumer demand and the decline in oil prices resulted in lower fuel surcharge revenues. Carloadings were down 1.4 million units, or 19%, reflecting declines across all commodity groups. NS partially offset this 25% decline in revenues with a $1.6 billion, or 21%, decrease in operating expenses. Notwithstanding these cost reductions, income from railway operations fell 36%, and the operating ratio, a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses, rose to 75.4%. Despite the decline in NS net income for 2009, cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion, which exceeded cash used for capital expenditures and dividends. Net proceeds from borrowings minus debt repayments was $403 million resulting in an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments, which at December 31, 2009 totaled $1.1 billion. Looking forward to 2010, NS expects revenues to increase, reflecting improved average revenue per unit and higher traffic volume due to a gradual, yet steady economic recovery. NS plans to continue to improve service and maintain a market based approach to pricing.  SUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  2009 Compared with 2008 Net income in 2009 was $1.0 billion, or $2.76 per diluted share, down $682 million, or 40%, compared with $1.7 billion, or $4.52 per diluted share, in 2008. The decrease in net income was primarily due to lower income from railway operations that was offset in part by lower income taxes (see Note 3). Railway operating revenues decreased $2.7 billion, reflecting lower traffic volumes and lower average revenue per unit primarily a result of decreased fuel surcharges. Railway operating expenses decreased $1.6 billion, principally due to lower volume related expenses and fuel prices. Oil prices affect NS results of operations in a variety of ways and can have an overall favorable or unfavorable impact in any particular period. In addition to the impact of oil prices on general economic conditions and traffic volume, oil prices directly affect NS revenues through market based fuel surcharges and contract escalators (see "Railway Operating Revenues") and also affect fuel costs (see "Railway Operating Expenses"). For 2009, excluding the impact of decreased consumption, the decline in fuel surcharge revenue was greater than the decline in fuel expense. Future changes in oil prices may cause volatility in operating results that could be material to a particular year or quarter.  2008 Compared with 2007 Net income in 2008 was $1.7 billion, up $252 million, or 17%, compared with 2007. Diluted earnings per share were $4.52, up 84, or 23%. The greater percentage increase in per share earnings was due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of NS share repurchase program (see Note 14). The increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations that was offset in part by higher income taxes (see Note 3). Railway operating revenues increased $1.2 billion, as higher average revenue per unit outweighed lower traffic volumes. Railway operating expenses increased $730 million, principally due to higher fuel costs and increased compensation and benefits expenses.  DETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Railway Operating Revenues Railway operating revenues were $8.0 billion in 2009, $10.7 billion in 2008, and $9.4 billion in 2007. The following table presents a three year comparison of revenues, volume, and average revenue per unit by market group.  Revenues   Units   Revenue per Unit  2009  2008  2007  2009  2008  2007  2009  2008   2007  ($ in millions)  (in thousands)   ($ per unit) Coal $ 2,264 $ 3,111 $ 2,315 1,418.5 1,765.7 1,699.4 $ 1,596 $ 1,762 $ 1,363 General merchandise: Agr./consumer/govt. 1,181 1,282 1,047 563.3 612.4 601.5 2,097 2,093 1,740 Chemicals 1,056 1,238 1,166 345.0 393.7 426.7 3,061 3,144 2,732 Metals/construction 745 1,251 1,149 504.2 742.4 783.6 1,478 1,686 1,467 Paper/clay/forest 666 898 860 306.4 394.1 428.1 2,172 2,280 2,010 Automotive 527 823 974 289.4 412.2 533.0 1,821 1,997 1,827 General merchandise 4,175 5,492 5,196 2,008.3 2,554.8 2,772.9 2,079 2,150 1,874 Intermodal 1,530 2,058 1,921 2,530.5 3,029.0 3,120.7 605 679 615 Total $ 7,969 $ 10,661 $ 9,432 5,957.3 7,349.5 7,593.0 $ 1,338 $ 1,451 $ 1,242 Revenues decreased $2.7 billion in 2009, but increased $1.2 billion in 2008. As reflected in the table on the following page, the decrease in 2009 was due to decreased traffic volumes and lower average revenue per unit, as a result of lower fuel surcharges that more than offset rate increases. The improvement in 2008 was the result of increased average revenue per unit, including fuel surcharge revenue, which more than offset decreased traffic volumes. Fuel surcharge revenue amounted to $370 million in 2009, compared with $1.6 billion in 2008, and $792 million in 2007. If fuel prices remain at or near year end 2009 levels, fuel surcharge revenues will increase in 2010. Many of NS negotiated fuel surcharges for coal and general merchandise traffic are based on the monthly average price of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI Average Price). These surcharges are reset the first day of each calendar month based on the WTI Average Price for the second preceding calendar month. This two month lag in applying WTI Average Price decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately $50 million in 2009 and increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately $100 million in 2008.  Revenue Variance Analysis Increases (Decreases)  2009 vs. 2008  2008 vs. 2007  ($ in millions) Traffic volume (units) $ (2,020) $ (302) Revenue per unit/mix (672) 1,531 Total $ (2,692) $ 1,229 For 2009, the unfavorable volume variance accounted for 75% of the total variance, reflecting traffic volume declines for all commodity groups. Volumes declined by 1.4 million units, or 19%, reflecting the weakened economy. The unfavorable revenue per unit/mix variance was driven by decreased fuel surcharges, offset in part by higher rates. In 2008, revenues increased $1.2 billion compared to 2007, reflecting large increases in average revenue per unit, a result of higher rates and increased fuel surcharges. Traffic volumes for all commodity groups except coal and agriculture/consumer products/government decreased compared to 2007. On January 26, 2007, the Surface Transportation Board (STB) issued a decision that the type of fuel surcharge imposed by NS and most other large railroads a fuel surcharge based on a percentage of line haul revenue would no longer be permitted for regulated traffic that moves under public (tariff) rates. The STB gave the railroads a 90 day transition period to adjust their fuel surcharge programs. During the second quarter of 2007, NS discontinued assessing fuel surcharges on its published (non intermodal) public rates. Adjustments to public prices now reflect ongoing market conditions. The traffic moving under these tariffs and public quotes comprises about 10% of NS total revenue base. COAL revenues decreased $847 million, or 27%, compared with 2008, reflecting a 20% decrease in traffic volume due to lower coal consumption in the utility and global raw steel sectors and lower average revenue per unit. Coal average revenue per unit was down 9% compared with 2008, reflecting decreased fuel surcharges and declining rate adjustment factors that more than offset rate increases. For 2010, average revenue per unit is expected to increase reflecting the effects of higher rates comprised of pricing increases, increasing contract escalators, higher fuel surcharges, and increased length of haul for export coal traffic. Coal represented 29% of NS revenues in 2009 and 80% of shipments handled originated on NS lines. As shown in the following table, tonnage declined in all coal markets.  Total Coal, Coke, and Iron Ore Tonnage   2009   2008   2007  (Tons in thousands) Utility 120,278 144,451 142,734 Export 17,885 23,069 15,564 Domestic metallurgical 11,848 18,155 17,873 Industrial 7,509 8,553 9,794 Total 157,520 194,228 185,965 In 2008, coal revenues increased $796 million, or 34%, compared with 2007, reflecting higher rates, including fuel surcharges, and a 4% increase in traffic volume. Coal average revenue per unit was up 29% compared with 2007, reflecting higher rates (which were comprised of pricing increases, contract escalators and the effect of increased longer haul export coal traffic) and increased fuel surcharges. NS was recently involved in litigation with Virginia Electric and Power Company/Old Dominion Electric Cooperative (Virginia Power) regarding rate adjustment provisions in a transportation contract between them. NS was also recently involved in litigation with a coal customer to enforce provisions of a transportation contract related to reimbursement of certain infrastructure expenses incurred by NS and minimum tonnage commitments and related deficit charges. NS settled both of these matters during the fourth quarter of 2009. The settlements did not have a material impact on NS financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Utility coal tonnage decreased 17% compared with 2008, a result of lower demand for electricity induced by the downturn in the U.S. economy, natural gas competition, and utility coal stockpiles that were above target levels across NS service area. In 2008, utility coal tonnage increased 1% compared with 2007, as a result of modest stockpile growth in the Northeast. For 2010, NS expects electricity demand and natural gas prices to increase, which should lead to higher coal fired generation and demand. However, utility coal tonnage may lag this recovery due to high stockpile levels, at least through the first half of the year. Export coal tonnage decreased 22% compared to 2008, reflecting the global recession, reduced demand for steel production and high inventory levels. Norfolk volume decreased about 34,000 carloads, or 20%, and Baltimore volume was down about 21,000 carloads, or 38%. In 2008, export coal tonnage increased 48% compared to 2007, primarily due to increased global demand coupled with weather related supply constraints in Australia, reduced export volume from China, and the weak U.S. dollar. Norfolk volume increased about 51,000 carloads, or 39%, and Baltimore volume was up about 28,000 carloads, or 102%. For 2010, export coal tonnage is expected to increase, reflecting improved demand for raw steel production. Domestic metallurgical coal, coke, and iron ore tonnage decreased 35% compared with 2008, reflecting reduced demand for raw steel caused by the downturn in the U.S. economy which led to blast furnace outages, reduced coke production schedules, and high inventory levels. In 2008, domestic metallurgical coal, coke, and iron ore tonnage increased 2% compared with 2007, reflecting the start up of a new coke plant. For 2010, domestic metallurgical coal, coke, and iron ore tonnage is expected to improve as the economy continues to recover, resulting in increased demand for raw steel production. Other coal tonnage (principally steam coal shipped to industrial plants) decreased 12% compared to 2008, principally due to reduced production at NS served plants caused by the downturn in the U.S. economy. In 2008, other coal tonnage decreased 13% compared to 2007, primarily due to coal supply constraints. For 2010, other coal tonnage is expected to be down compared to 2009, reflecting reduced industrial coal consumption. GENERAL MERCHANDISE revenues in 2009 decreased $1.3 billion, or 24%, compared with 2008, reflecting a 21% decline in traffic volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per unit, as higher rates were overshadowed by decreased fuel surcharge revenues. In 2008, general merchandise revenues increased $296 million, or 6%, compared with 2007, as a 15% increase in average revenue per unit, reflecting continued market based pricing and higher fuel surcharges, more than offset an 8% decline in traffic. Agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues decreased 8% in 2009, compared with 2008. The revenue decline resulted from an 8% decrease in traffic volumes as plant closures and production curtailments led to fewer shipments of fertilizer and corn. In 2008, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues increased 22%, compared with 2007. The revenue improvement resulted from higher average revenue per unit, which reflected increased rates and higher fuel surcharge revenues. Traffic volume increased 2% as more ethanol, military, feed, soybeans, and food oils shipments offset declines in fertilizers, corn, beverages, and consumer products. For 2010, agriculture revenues are expected to increase as a result of increased volumes and higher average revenue per unit, reflecting expected growth in the agri fuels market, including corn for ethanol production and finished ethanol as well as increased fertilizer shipments. Chemicals revenues in 2009 decreased 15%, compared with 2008, due to a 12% decrease in traffic volume and a 3% decline in average revenue per unit, primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges. The decline in traffic volume was a result of continued weakness in housing construction which drove declines in industrial intermediates, plastics and miscellaneous chemicals. Volumes associated with petroleum based products also declined as a result of reduced demand for asphalt and production curtailments. In 2008, chemicals revenue increased 6%, compared with 2007, a result of increased rates and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Traffic volume declined 8%, reflecting continued weakness in both industrial intermediates and plastics (linked to housing construction declines) in addition to miscellaneous chemicals and petroleum based products. For 2010, chemicals revenues are expected to improve, principally due to higher average revenue per unit and modestly increased traffic volumes. Metals and construction revenues decreased 40% in 2009, reflecting a 32% decrease in traffic volume and a 12% decline in average revenue per unit, primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges. The decline in traffic volume was principally due to lower coil, scrap metal, iron and steel shipments, in addition to reduced demand for construction materials as a result of continued weakness in the housing, infrastructure, and automotive sectors. In 2008, metals and construction revenues increased 9% as a 15% increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from increased rates and higher fuel surcharge more than offset the effects of a 5% decrease in traffic volume. The decline in volume was due to reduced demand for construction materials and lower coil, iron, and steel shipments, reflecting the weak housing and automotive sectors. For 2010, metals and construction revenues are expected to increase as a result of a rise in average revenue per unit, and higher construction related traffic volumes due to growth driven by increased federal and state infrastructure projects and recovery in residential construction. Paper, clay, and forest products revenues decreased 26% in 2009, compared with 2008, due to a 22% decrease in traffic volumes and a 5% decline in average revenue per unit, primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges. The volume decline reflected lower pulp board, lumber, kaolin, printing paper, and wood chip shipments due to reduced U. S. paper production and the slowdown in the housing market. In 2008, paper, clay, and forest products revenues increased 4% compared with 2007 due to a 13% increase in average revenue per unit which more than offset an 8% decrease in traffic volume. The volume decline reflected the continued housing slowdown and increased trucking capacity available to paper customers. For 2010, paper, clay, and forest products revenues are expected to be modestly higher as slight average revenue per unit increases will be offset in part by slightly lower volumes driven by expectations for a gradual economic recovery during the course of the year as the housing market rebounds from historical lows. Automotive revenues decreased 36% in 2009, compared to 2008, reflecting lower traffic volumes and decreased average revenue per unit as fuel surcharges were lower. Volumes decreased 30%, primarily as a result of a 32% decrease in North American light vehicle production as manufacturers cut production in line with consumer demand. In 2008, automotive revenues decreased 16% compared to 2007 as lower traffic volumes offset higher average revenue per unit. Volumes decreased 23%, reflecting reduced North American sales and production. Automotive manufacturers, especially the domestic producers, continued to experience significant sales declines during the year. Three assembly plants closed during the year and six implemented shift reductions. In addition, one manufacturer temporarily closed an assembly plant to retool for a new product in 2010. For 2010, automotive revenues are expected to increase driven by higher average revenue per unit related to network changes and the renegotiation of several contracts. Automotive volumes are expected to remain relatively flat. INTERMODAL revenues decreased $528 million, or 26%, compared with 2008, reflecting a 16% reduction in traffic volume and an 11% decrease in average revenue per unit. In 2009, all intermodal segments experienced depressed volumes, reflecting the weak economy and lower consumer demand. International traffic volume declined 30%; Premium business, which includes parcel and less than truckload (LTL) carriers, decreased 14%; Triple Crown Services (Triple Crown), a service with rail to highway trailers, experienced a 10% drop in volume; and Domestic volume (which includes truckload and intermodal marketing companies volumes) decreased less than 1%. In 2008, intermodal revenues increased $137 million, or 7%, compared with 2007, as a 10% increase in average revenue per unit (including fuel surcharges) offset a 3% reduction in traffic volumes. Domestic volume increased 8% compared with 2007, reflecting the relative fuel efficiency of intermodal versus over the road transportation and service improvements. International traffic volume declined 9%, primarily driven by the weak economy and less inland rail movement of West Coast port traffic that was partially offset by East Coast port volume growth. The Premium business, which includes parcel and LTL carriers, decreased 6%, as reduced private empty movements and soft parcel business offset LTL conversions. Triple Crown, a service with rail to highway trailers, experienced a 3% drop in volume primarily driven by reduced auto parts shipments. For 2010, intermodal revenues are expected to experience a moderate increase due to higher average revenue per unit and volumes as a result of a slowly strengthening economy.  Railway Operating Expenses Railway operating expenses in 2009 were $6 billion, down $1.6 billion, or 21%, compared to 2008. Expenses in 2008 were $7.6 billion, up $730 million, or 11%, compared to 2007. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to lower volume related expenses and lower fuel prices. The increase in 2008 was primarily due to higher fuel costs and increased compensation and benefits expenses. The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses, rose to 75.4% in 2009, compared with 71.1% in 2008 and 72.6% in 2007. The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications.  Operating Expense Variances Increases (Decreases)  2009 vs. 2008  2008 vs. 2007  ($ in millions) Compensation and benefits $ (283) $ 132 Purchased services and rents (196) 48 Fuel (913) 469 Depreciation 33 29 Materials and other (211) 52 Total $ (1,570) $ 730 Compensation and benefits, which represents 40% of total operating expenses, decreased $283 million, or 11%, compared with 2008, primarily due to lower volume related payroll (down $217 million); reduced incentive and stock based compensation (down $117 million); the absence of the cost of lump sum payments due under the 2008 Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) agreement ($31 million); and, lower payroll taxes (down $26 million). These decreases were partially offset by increased wage rates (up $53 million); increased pension costs (up $42 million); and higher medical benefits (up $25 million). In 2008, compensation and benefits increased $132 million, or 5%, compared with 2007, primarily due to higher incentive compensation (up $66 million); increased wage rates (up $54 million); costs associated with lump sum payments due under the BLET agreement; higher payroll taxes (up $15 million); and, the absence of the 2007 employment tax refund ($9 million). These were partially offset by lower costs associated with trainees (down $19 million); lower medical benefits resulting from higher employee contributions (down $19 million); and, lower stock based compensation (down $7 million). In 2008, compensation and benefits expense also benefited from a net pension credit of $39 million. NS employment averaged 28,593 in 2009 compared with 30,709 in 2008 and 30,806 in 2007. The 2009 decrease was a direct result of volume declines during the year. NS monitors forecasted volumes in light of current economic conditions to ensure appropriate employment levels for service needs. For 2010, NS expects agreement wages and premiums for medical benefits, combined, will increase by approximately $148 million compared to 2009. Purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses decreased $196 million, or 12%, in 2009 compared to 2008, but increased $48 million, or 3%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Purchased services costs were $1.087 billion in 2009, $1.242 billion in 2008, and $1.172 billion in 2007. The decrease in 2009 reflected lower volume related expenses such as transportation operating costs (including automotive related costs and crew transportation expenses), intermodal operations costs, and mechanical and engineering expenses (largely because of reduced maintenance activities). These declines were offset in part by increased professional and legal services. The increase in 2008 reflected higher intermodal operations costs, transportation operating costs, and professional and legal services. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, amounted to $316 million, $357 million, and $379 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The decrease in 2009 and 2008 was principally due to lower shipment volumes while 2008 also reflected improved fleet utilization. Fuel expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations, decreased $913 million, or 56%, in 2009 compared with 2008, but increased $469 million, or 40%, in 2008 compared with 2007. The decline in 2009 was principally the result of lower fuel prices which had an impact of $600 million and reduced fuel consumption which had an impact of $313 million. The increase in 2008 reflected higher fuel prices which had an impact of $511 million that was offset in part by a decline in consumption which had an impact of $42 million. Locomotive fuel prices declined 47% in 2009 compared with a 45% increase in 2008, and locomotive fuel consumption was down 19% in 2009 and 3% in 2008. Depreciation expense increased $33 million, or 4%, in 2009 compared to 2008, and $29 million, or 4%, in 2008 compared to 2007, reflecting substantial capital investments and improvements as NS continues to invest in its infrastructure and equipment. Materials and other expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage, and environmental matters) decreased $211 million, or 25%, in 2009 compared with 2008, but increased $52 million, or 7%, in 2008 compared with 2007, as shown in the following table.  2009  2008  2007  ($ in millions) Materials $ 309 $ 380 $ 359 Casualties and other claims 102 180 171 Other 230 292 270 $ 641 $ 852 $ 800 The decrease in 2009 reflects lower locomotive, freight car, and roadway materials expenses, lower loss and damage claims, favorable personal injury claims development, reduced employee travel costs, a $21 million favorable adjustment related to settlement of a multi year state tax dispute, and the absence of the 2008 Avondale Mills settlement (see additional discussion below). The increase in 2008 was primarily due to costs associated with the Avondale Mills settlement, as well as higher loss and damage claims and increased material costs for equipment and roadway repairs. These increases were partially offset by favorable personal injury claims development. In April 2008, NS settled the lawsuit brought by Avondale Mills for claims associated with the January 6, 2005 derailment in Graniteville, SC. A portion of the settlement was not reimbursed by insurance and was included in 2008 expenses. The total liability related to the derailment represents NS best estimate based on current facts and circumstances. The estimate includes amounts related to property damage, personal injury and response costs. NS commercial insurance policies are expected to cover substantially all expenses related to this derailment above the unreimbursed portion and NS self insured retention, including NS response costs and legal fees. The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect long term receivables for estimated recoveries from NS insurance carriers. NS is engaged in arbitration with two of its insurance carriers that failed to respond to insurance claims submitted by NS. NS believes these expenses are covered by the insurance policies and recoveries of the contested amounts are probable. Accordingly, NS has recorded the full recovery attributable to each carrier ($100 million and $43 million). The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. Cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 48% of total employee injury cases resolved and about 19% of total payments made. With its long established commitment to safety, NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. With respect to occupational injuries, which are not caused by a specific accident or event but allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time, the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately. These types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads. FELAs fault based system, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance (see Note 17). NS expects insurance costs to be slightly higher in 2010.  Other Income Net Other income net was $127 million in 2009, $110 million in 2008, and $93 million in 2007 (see Note 2). The increase in 2009 reflected higher net returns from corporate owned life insurance (up $32 million) offset in part by fewer gains on the sale of property (down $11 million). The increase in 2008 reflected the absence of expenses related to synthetic fuel adjustments (see "Income Taxes" below), reduced other interest expense ($27 million) largely due to adjustments to reflect the outcome of certain tax examinations and higher coal royalties (up $12 million). These benefits were offset in part by lower returns and higher borrowing costs on corporate owned life insurance (down $38 million), lower interest income (down $25 million), fewer gains on sales of property and investments (down $22 million), and lower equity in the earnings of Conrail (down $16 million), which reflects the absence of a tax audit settlement recorded by Conrail in 2007 ($18 million). NS has membership interests representing ownership in companies that owned and operated facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal. In addition, NS purchased two facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal in 2007. The production of synthetic fuel resulted in tax credits as well as expenses related to the investments. The expenses are recorded as a component of "Other income net" and the tax credits, as well as tax benefits related to the expenses, are reflected in "Provision for income taxes" (see further discussion below).  Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2009 was $588 million, for an effective rate of 36%, compared with effective rates of 38% in 2008 and 35% in 2007. The decrease in the rate for 2009 was primarily due to improved net returns from corporate owned life insurance and the favorable resolution of state tax issues. The increase in the rate for 2008 was primarily due to the absence of synthetic fuel related tax credits that expired at the end of 2007. The tax credits generated by NS synthetic fuel related investments reduced the effective tax rate by 3% in 2007. Net income in 2007 reflected $13 million in net benefits from these credits as shown below:  2007  ($ in millions) Effect in "Other income net:" Expenses on synthetic fuel related investments $ 77 Effect in "Provision for income taxes:" Tax credits 60 Tax benefit of expenses on synthetic fuel related investments 30 Total reduction of income tax expense  90 Effect in "Net income:" Net benefit from synthetic fuel related investments $ 13 Bonus depreciation was allowed for federal income taxes for 2008 and 2009 but expired at the end of 2009. As a result, current taxes have been lower in recent years than might be expected in future years. During 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its examination of NS 2006 and 2007 consolidated federal income tax returns without a material effect on income tax expense. NS consolidated federal income tax return for 2008 is being audited by the IRS.   FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $1.9 billion in 2009 compared with $2.7 billion in 2008 and $2.3 billion in 2007. The decline in 2009 reflects the $1.1 billion decrease in income from railway operations offset in part by lower income tax payments. The improvement in 2008 resulted from increased railway operating income and from bonus tax depreciation which reduced current tax payments. NS had working capital of $457 million at December 31, 2009, compared with a working capital deficit of $106 million at December 31, 2008. The improvement was largely due to higher cash, cash equivalents and short term investment balances at year end, as well as the impact of lower income from railway operations that resulted in decreases in current income taxes and accounts payable, offset in part by decreases in accounts receivable and increases in short term debt. NS expects that cash on hand combined with cash flow provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations. NS cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances totaled $1.1 billion and $618 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Contractual obligations at December 31, 2009, comprised of NS long term debt (including capital leases) (see Note 8), operating leases (see Note 9), agreements with CRC and long term advances from Conrail (see Note 5), unconditional purchase obligations (see Note 17), and unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 3),were as follows:  Payments Due By Period  2011  2013  2015 and  Total  2010  2012  2014  Subsequent  Other  ($ in millions) Long term debt and capital lease principal $ 7,053 $ 374 $ 414 $ 492 $ 5,773 $ Operating leases 724 111 177 124 312 Agreements with CRC 424 29 58 58 279 Unconditional purchase obligations 228 105 44 23 56 Long term advances from Conrail 133 133 Unrecognized tax benefits* 94 94 Total $  8,656 $  619 $  693 $  697 $  6,553 $  94 * When the amount and timing of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits can be reasonably estimated, the amount is shown in the table under the appropriate period. When the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated, the amount is shown in the Other column.  Off balance sheet arrangements consist of obligations related to operating leases, which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in Note 9.  Cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion in 2009, compared with $1.2 billion in 2008 and $1 billion in 2007. The increase in 2009 primarily reflected lower proceeds from investment sales and higher investment purchases, offset in part by lower property additions. The increase in 2008 primarily reflected increased property additions. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending (including capital leases) and track and equipment statistics for the past five years.  Capital Expenditures   2009  2008  2007  2006  2005  ($ in millions) Road and other property $ 1,128 $ 1,070 $ 894 $ 756 $ 741 Equipment 171 488 447  422 284 Total $ 1,299 $ 1,558 $ 1,341 $  1,178 $ 1,025  Track Structure Statistics (Capital and Maintenance)   2009  2008  2007  2006  2005 Track miles of rail installed 434 459 401 327 302 Miles of track surfaced 5,568 5,209 5,014 4,871 4,663 New crossties installed (millions) 2.7 2.7 2.7 2.7 2.5  Average Age of Owned Railway Equipment   2009  2008  2007  2006  2005  (years) Freight cars 30.3 29.9 30.1 30.0 29.4 Locomotives 19.9 18.9 18.1 17.7 17.4 Retired locomotives 31.2 34.4 30.0 35.0 27.4 For 2010, NS has budgeted $1.44 billion for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $706 million for roadway projects, including the normalized replacement of rail, ties and ballast, and the improvement or replacement of bridges. Planned investments in facilities and terminals of $184 million are primarily for intermodal terminals and equipment to add capacity to the intermodal network, including the Crescent Corridor initiative, and bulk transfer facilities and mechanical service shops. Technology investments of $140 million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers. The majority of the anticipated spending on technology investments is attributable to preliminary implementation of positive train control. Infrastructure investments of $110 million are planned for various public private partnership investments such as the Heartland Corridor and the Chicago Regional Environmental and Transportation Efficiency (CREATE) project, and network improvements to increase mainline capacity and accommodate traffic growth. NS also expects to spend $81 million on equipment, primarily continued improvements to the locomotive fleet, including the rebuild and upgrade of existing units. All capital expenditures are expected to be made with internally generated funds. NS expects implementation of positive train control to result in additional capital expenditures of at least $700 million in the years 2011 through 2015. The Heartland Corridor is a package of proposed clearance improvements and other facilities that will create a seamless high capacity intermodal route across Virginia and West Virginia to Midwest markets. During 2006, NS, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and the states of Ohio, West Virginia and Virginia entered into a Memoranda of Agreement with respect to the tunnel clearance component of the Heartland Corridor that governs the release of up to $95 million in authorized federal funding. In 2006, NS also entered into agreements with two states governing the use of up to $11 million in state funding for the Heartland Corridor rail double stack clearance project. NS began work on the Heartland Corridor tunnel clearances in October 2007 and the entire project is expected to be completed in 2010. NS expects to spend about $23 million in 2010 in connection with this project. The CREATE project is a public private partnership to reduce rail and highway congestion and add freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan Chicago area. NS and other railroads have agreed to participate in CREATE. A portion of public funding has been approved and the parties have developed a list of projects to be included in Phase I of the project. A total of $100 million in public funding has been secured for Phase I and the railroads have contributed an additional $100 million. The railroads expect to complete Phase I by the end of 2011. As currently planned, the total project is estimated to cost $3.1 billion with city, state, and federal support. If additional public funding is secured, the railroads are expected to contribute a total of $169 million towards the entire project. NS expects to spend approximately $11 million in 2010 related to the CREATE projects. The Meridian Speedway is a 320 mile rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana. On May 1, 2006, NS and Kansas City Southern (KCS) formed a joint venture, Meridian Speedway LLC (MSLLC), pursuant to which NS will contribute $300 million in cash, substantially all of which will be used for capital improvements in exchange for a 30% interest in the joint venture. To date, NS has contributed $283 million. At the formation of MSLLC, KCS contributed the Meridian Speedway. NS is recognizing its pro rata share of the joint ventures earnings or loss as required under the equity method of accounting. NS total investment in MSLLC is supported by the fair value of the rail line as well as intangible assets obtained through the transaction. The joint venture increases capacity and is designed to improve service over the Meridian Speedway into the Southeast. During the second quarter of 2009, NS and Pan Am Railways, Inc. (Pan Am) formed a joint venture, Pan Am Southern LLC (PAS), a railroad company in which each has a 50% equity interest. Pan Am contributed to PAS a 155 mile main line track that runs between Mechanicville, New York and Ayer, Massachusetts, along with 281 miles of secondary and branch lines, including trackage rights in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont (collectively, the "PAS Lines"), and as of December 31, 2009, NS has contributed cash and other property with a combined value of approximately $69 million and committed to contribute an additional $71 million in cash over the next three years as evidenced by the Pan Am Notes (see Note 8). A significant portion of NS contributions has and will continue to be used for capital improvements to the PAS Lines and the related construction of new intermodal and automotive terminals in Albany, New York and the Ayer, Massachusetts areas. PAS is jointly controlled by NS and Pan Am, accordingly, NS accounts for its interest in PAS using the equity method of accounting. The Crescent Corridor consists of a program of improvements to infrastructure and other facilities geared toward creating a seamless, high capacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from New Jersey to Louisiana and offering truck competitive service along several major interstate highway corridors, including I 81, I 85, I 20, I 40, I 59, and I 75. Based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief, NS plans to implement certain elements of the Crescent Corridor program of projects through a series of public private partnerships. Although there is not yet a single, integrated plan for the Crescent Corridor, preliminary work has begun and is slated to continue in 2010, including continued infrastructure improvements and other design and engineering work along the Virginia portion of the Corridor consistent with NS matching obligation with respect to funds provided by the Commonwealth of Virginia. If requested public private partnership agreements are funded in 2010, NS capital expenditures in 2010 related to Crescent Corridor projects may be as high as $41 million. The MidAmerica Corridor is a proposed cooperative arrangement between NS and Canadian National Railway (CN) to effectively share track between Chicago, St. Louis, Kentucky, and Mississippi in order to establish more efficient routes for traffic moving between the midwestern and southeastern U.S., including potential coal traffic moving to NS served southeastern utility plants from CN served Illinois Basin coal producers. To implement the MidAmerica Corridor, NS, at its option, would expend funds to upgrade the rail line operated by West Tennessee Railway between Fulton, Kentucky, and Corinth, Mississippi, a line over which NS would operate pursuant to recently obtained trackage rights. Full implementation of the MidAmerica Corridor arrangement is subject to regulatory approvals. Cash used in financing activities was $31 million in 2009, compared with $1.1 billion in 2008, and $1.6 billion in 2007. The change in 2009 reflected the absence of share repurchase activity during the period and higher borrowings net of debt repayments that were offset in part by fewer exercises of employee stock options and increased dividends. Due to current economic and market conditions, the amount of future share repurchases is uncertain and the timing and volume of such repurchases will be guided by managements assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflected a net increase in debt, compared with a net decline in 2007, which was offset in part by higher dividend payments. During the second quarter of 2009, NS issued $500 million of unsecured notes at 5.90% due 2019 pursuant to its automatic shelf registration statement described below (see Note 8). The net proceeds from the offering were $496 million after deducting the purchase discount and expenses. NS also issued a total of $75 million in non interest bearing notes payable with maturity dates beginning in 2010 and ending in 2012 as part of its total investment in Pan Am Southern LLC. During the first quarter of 2009, NS issued $500 million of unsecured notes at 5.75% due 2016 in a private offering. The net proceeds from the offering were $494 million after deducting the purchase discount and expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2009, NS exchanged the unregistered securities with essentially identical securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933. NS has authority from its Board of Directors to issue an additional $500 million of debt or equity securities through public or private sale. During the first quarter of 2009, NS filed a Form S 3 automatic shelf registration statement for well known seasoned issuers under which, as of December 31, 2009, up to $500 million could be issued under this authority. NS also has in place and available a $1 billion, five year credit agreement expiring in 2012, which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants. NS had no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2009, and NS is in compliance with all of its covenants. In October 2009, NS renewed and amended its accounts receivable securitization program with a 364 day term to run until October 2010. NS reduced the total amount that can be borrowed from $500 million to $350 million to more closely match its liquidity requirements and receivables profile. There was $200 million outstanding under this program at December 31, 2009 (see Note 8). Looking forward, NS annual debt maturities are relatively modest and stable from year to year (see Note 8). Overall, NS goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support NS business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles.  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require management to make changes to these estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management regularly discusses the development, selection, and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.    Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions (see Note 11). These include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans assets, projected increases in medical costs, and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality. In addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value. Management makes these estimates based on the companys historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance). Management utilizes an independent consulting actuarial firms studies to assist it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities. NS net pension expense, which is included in "Compensation and benefits" in its Consolidated Statements of Income, was $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In recording this amount, NS assumed a long term investment rate of return of 8.75%, which was supported by the long term total rate of return on plan assets since inception. A one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $16 million change to the pension expense, and, as a result, an equal change in "Compensation and benefits" expense. Changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on NS net pension expense or net pension liability in the future. The net pension liability is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments. NS utilizes an analysis in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans were matched with a yield curve based on an appropriate universe of high quality corporate bonds. NS used the results of the yield curve to select the discount rate that matches the payment stream of the benefits in these plans. NS net cost for other postretirement benefits, which is also included in "Compensation and benefits," was $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. In recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits, which is included in "Other postretirement benefits," management estimated future increases in health care costs. These assumptions, along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them, are described in Note 11.  Properties and Depreciation Most of NS total assets are long lived railway properties (see Note 6). As disclosed in Note 1, NS properties are depreciated using group depreciation. Rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured by gross ton miles. Other properties are depreciated generally using the straight line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives. NS reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows. Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value. NS depreciation expense is based on managements assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement. In developing these assumptions, NS management utilizes periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an outside firm of consulting engineers. These studies analyze NS historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change in operation or maintenance practices. NS recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties, these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense. The studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property. NS depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, amounted to $837 million. NS weighted average depreciation rates for 2009 are disclosed in Note 6; a one tenth percentage point increase (or decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a $29 million increase (or decrease) to depreciation expense.  Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities NS expense for casualties and other claims, included in "Materials and other," amounted to $102 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Most of this expense was NS accrual related to personal injury liabilities. Job related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to railroads. FELAs fault based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no fault workers compensation system. The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded. In all cases, NS records a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable. To aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period, NS management utilizes studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm. For employee personal injury cases, the actuarial firm studies NS historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences. An estimate of the ultimate amount of the liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims, is based on the results of this analysis. For occupational injury claims, the actuarial firm studies NS history of claim filings, severity, payments and other relevant facts. Additionally, the estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting NS experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined. NS has recorded this actuarially determined liability. The liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic studies. Accordingly, there could be significant changes in the liability, which NS would recognize when such a change became known. Recent actuarial studies have reflected favorable claims development and, accordingly, those changes in estimates have reduced the annual cost related to personal injuries to $51 million in 2009 from $78 million in 2008. While the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate liability could be higher or lower. NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably (see Note 17). Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS, are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $20 million in 2009, $18 million in 2008, and $16 million in 2007, and capital expenditures for environmental matters totaled approximately $11 million in 2009 and $7 million in both 2008 and 2007. Capital expenditures for environmental matters in 2010 are expected to be about $9 million. NS Consolidated Balance Sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $32 million at December 31, 2009, and $42 million at December 31, 2008 (of which $12 million is classified as a current liability at the end of each period). At December 31, 2009, the liability represents NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 144 known locations. As of that date, nine sites accounted for $15 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At 30 locations, one or more NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. NS estimates its environmental remediation liability on a site by site basis, using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site. As a result, it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments. NS has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities. On April 24, 2008, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) brought an action against NS for alleged violations of federal environmental laws resulting from the discharge of chlorine and oil that occurred as a result of the January 6, 2005 derailment in Graniteville, SC, including claims for civil penalties as well as injunctive relief. Although NS June 24, 2008 motion to dismiss for failure to allege sufficient facts was granted, DOJ was given leave to, and did, amend its complaint. The litigation has been stayed by the district court as the parties work to conclude an agreed upon consent decree. NS does not believe that the resolution of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. Based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, management believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which NS is aware. Further, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations. When management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to expenses. While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments, in managements opinion the recorded liability, if any, is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims. However, the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter. Any adjustments to recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known.  Income Taxes NS net long term deferred tax liability totaled $6.7 billion at December 31, 2009 (see Note 3). This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns. For state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized. NS had a $14 million valuation allowance on $871 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2009, reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized. In addition, NS has a recorded liability for its estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. Management believes this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded. For every one half percent change in the 2009 effective tax rate, net income would have changed by $8 million.  OTHER MATTERS  Labor Agreements More than 80% of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (RLA). NS largely bargains nationally in concert with other major railroads. Moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may propose changes. NS reached national agreements that extended through 2009 with all of the major rail unions. The current agreement with the BLET extends through 2014. Because NS has reached separate agreements with the BLET and the American Train Dispatchers Association (ATDA), only the health and welfare provisions from the national agreements apply to NS locomotive engineers and ATDA represented dispatchers. NS has also reached agreement with Longshoremen at Ashtabula (Ohio) Docks who are represented by the International Longshoremens Association (ILA) and do not participate in national bargaining. On or after November 1, 2009, NS and the nations other major carriers served new proposals to begin the next round of negotiations. The outcome of the negotiations cannot be determined at this point.   Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. At December 31, 2009, NS debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $204 million. A 1% point increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $2 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. Some of NS capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On December 31, 2009, the average pay rate under these agreements was 1%, and the average receive rate was 6%. During 2009 and 2008, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by less than $1 million in both periods. A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy.  Inflation In preparing financial statements, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such property. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.  Proposed Legislation and Regulations on Safety and Transportation of Hazardous Materials Federal regulations were adopted in late 2008 on safety and transportation of hazardous materials. NS is in compliance with those regulations currently effective and expects to be in compliance with those regulations to become effective at a later date.  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate," and "project." Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic and international economic conditions; interest rates; the business environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; the operations of carriers with which NS interchanges; acts of terrorism or war; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory developments; results of litigation; changes in securities and capital markets; disruptions to NS technology infrastructure, including computer systems; and natural events such as severe weather, hurricanes, and floods. For a discussion of significant risk factors applicable to NS, see Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors." Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guarantee of future performance or results, nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. NS undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements.
