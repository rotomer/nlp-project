Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Norfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and the Selected Financial Data. OVERVIEW NS results in 2010 reflect a substantial increase in revenues due to increased traffic volumes and higher average revenue per unit, driven by the growth of domestic and global economies. Revenues increased $1.5 billion, or 19%, in 2010, as higher demand for rail freight transportation led to additional volumes. Carloadings were up 806,800 units, or 14%, reflecting growth in all commodity groups. Operating expenses increased $833 million, reflecting increased traffic volumes as well as higher fuel prices. Despite the 14% increase in expenses, the operating ratio, a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses, improved to 71.9%, and income from railway operations rose 36%. Cash provided by operating activities was $2.7 billion, which allowed for capital expenditures and share repurchases. During 2010, 14.7 million shares of Norfolk Southern Corporation common stock (Common Stock) were repurchased at a total cost of $863 million. Since inception of the stock repurchase program in 2006, NS has repurchased and retired 79.4 million shares of Common Stock at a total cost of $4.1 billion. At December 31, 2010, cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments totaled $1.1 billion. Looking forward to 2011, NS expects revenues to increase, reflecting higher traffic volumes but at a more modest pace than seen in 2010, and improved average revenue per unit. NS plans to continue to focus on safety, improve service levels and maintain a market based approach to pricing. SUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2010 Compared with 2009 Net income in 2010 was $1.5 billion, or $4.00 per diluted share, up $462 million, or 45%, compared with $1.0 billion, or $2.76 per diluted share, in 2009. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations that was offset in part by higher income taxes (see Note 3). Railway operating revenues increased $1.5 billion, reflecting higher traffic volumes and higher average revenue per unit, including fuel surcharges. Railway operating expenses increased $833 million, principally due to higher volume related expenses and fuel prices. Oil prices affect NS results of operations in a variety of ways and can have an overall favorable or unfavorable impact in any particular period. In addition to the impact of oil prices on general economic conditions and traffic volume, oil prices directly affect NS revenues through market based fuel surcharges and contract escalators (see Railway Operating Revenues) and also affect fuel costs (see Railway Operating Expenses). For 2010, excluding the impact of increased consumption, the increase in fuel surcharge revenue was greater than the increase in fuel expense. Future changes in oil prices may cause volatility in operating results that could be material to a particular year or quarter. K20 2009 Compared with 2008 Net income in 2009 was $1.0 billion, or $2.76 per diluted share, down $682 million, or 40%, compared with $1.7 billion, or $4.52 per diluted share, in 2008. The decrease in net income was primarily due to lower income from railway operations that was offset in part by lower income taxes (see Note 3). Railway operating revenues decreased $2.7 billion, reflecting lower traffic volumes and lower average revenue per unit primarily a result of decreased fuel surcharges. Railway operating expenses decreased $1.6 billion, primarily due to lower volume related expenses and fuel prices. DETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Railway Operating Revenues Railway operating revenues were $9.5 billion in 2010, $8.0 billion in 2009, and $10.7 billion in 2008. The following table presents a three year comparison of revenues, volumes, and average revenue per unit by market group. Revenues Units Revenue per Unit 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 ($ in millions) (in thousands) ($ per unit) Coal $ 2,719 $ 2,264 $ 3,111 1,556.7 1,418.5 1,765.7 $ 1,747 $ 1,596 $ 1,762 General merchandise: Agr./consumer/govt. 1,326 1,181 1,282 627.7 563.3 612.4 2,113 2,097 2,093 Chemicals 1,302 1,056 1,238 406.1 345.0 393.7 3,207 3,061 3,144 Metals/construction 1,013 745 1,251 628.4 504.2 742.4 1,612 1,478 1,686 Paper/clay/forest 712 666 898 327.7 306.4 394.1 2,171 2,172 2,280 Automotive 648 527 823 290.4 289.4 412.2 2,232 1,821 1,997 General merchandise 5,001 4,175 5,492 2,280.3 2,008.3 2,554.8 2,193 2,079 2,150 Intermodal 1,796 1,530 2,058 2,927.1 2,530.5 3,029.0 614 605 679 Total $ 9,516 $ 7,969 $ 10,661 6,764.1 5,957.3 7,349.5 $ 1,407 $ 1,338 $ 1,451 Revenues increased $1.5 billion in 2010, but decreased $2.7 billion in 2009. As reflected in the table on the following page, the increase in 2010 was due to increased traffic volumes and higher average revenue per unit, which was driven by higher fuel surcharges and rate increases, offset in part by the effects of changes in the mix of traffic. The decrease in 2009 was due to decreased traffic volumes and lower average revenue per unit, as a result of lower fuel surcharges, that more than offset rate increases. Fuel surcharge revenue amounted to $724 million in 2010, compared with $370 million in 2009, and $1.6 billion in 2008. If fuel prices remain at or near year end 2010 levels, fuel surcharge revenues will increase in 2011. Many of NS negotiated fuel surcharges for coal and general merchandise traffic are based on the monthly average price of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI Average Price). These surcharges are reset the first day of each calendar month based on the WTI Average Price for the second preceding calendar month. This two month lag in applying WTI Average Price decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately $28 million in 2010 and $50 million in 2009, but increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately $100 million in 2008. K21 Revenue Variance Analysis Increases (Decreases) 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 ($ in millions) Traffic volume (units) $ 1,079 $ (2,020) Revenue per unit 468 (672) Total $ 1,547 $ (2,692) For 2010, the favorable volume variance accounted for 70% of the total increase, reflecting traffic volume improvements in all commodity groups. Volumes increased by 806,800 units, or 14%, reflecting the strengthening of the economy. The favorable revenue per unit variance reflected increased fuel surcharges and higher rates, offset in part by the effects of changes in the mix of traffic. In 2009, the unfavorable volume variance accounted for 75% of the total decrease, reflecting traffic volume declines for all commodity groups. Volumes declined by 1.4 million units, or 19%, reflecting the weakened economy. The unfavorable revenue per unit variance was driven by decreased fuel surcharges, offset in part by higher rates. Two of NS customers, DuPont and South Mississippi Electric Power Association (SMEPA), have filed rate reasonableness complaints at the Surface Transportation Board (STB) alleging that the NS tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable. NS is disputing these allegations. Since June 1, 2009, in the case of DuPont, and since January 1, 2011, in the case of SMEPA, NS has been billing and collecting amounts from the customers based on the challenged tariff rates. Management presently expects resolution of these cases to occur in late 2012 or 2013. Although the cases have not progressed to a point where management can evaluate the likelihood of the outcome, unfavorable rulings could have a materially adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. COAL revenues increased $455 million, or 20%, compared with 2009, reflecting higher average revenue per unit and a 10% increase in traffic principally due to a rise in domestic and global steel production. Coal average revenue per unit was up 9%, compared with 2009, reflecting increased fuel surcharge revenue and improved pricing. For 2011, coal revenues are expected to increase due to higher volumes and increased average revenue per unit driven by pricing improvement, higher fuel surcharges, and contract escalators. Coal represented 28% of NS revenues in 2010 and 80% of shipments handled originated on NS lines. As shown in the following table, tonnage increased in all coal markets. Total Coal, Coke, and Iron Ore Tonnage 2010 2009 2008 (tons in thousands) Utility 120,737 120,278 144,451 Export 22,750 17,885 23,069 Domestic metallurgical 19,771 11,848 18,155 Industrial 7,573 7,509 8,553 Total 170,831 157,520 194,228 In 2009, coal revenues decreased $847 million, or 27%, compared with 2008, reflecting a 20% decrease in traffic volume due to lower coal consumption in the utility and global raw steel sectors and lower average revenue per unit. Coal average revenue per unit was down 9% compared with 2008, reflecting decreased fuel surcharges and declining rate adjustment factors that more than offset rate increases. K22 Utility coal tonnage improved slightly as residential demand increased due to severe winter weather and above average summer temperatures on the east coast. Additionally, electricity demand in the industrial sector was higher. These increases more than offset the effects of low natural gas prices and the divergence of utility coal to the export market. In 2009, utility coal tonnage decreased 17% compared with 2008, a result of lower demand for electricity induced by the downturn in the U.S. economy, natural gas competition, and utility coal stockpiles that were above target levels across NS service area. For 2011, utility coal tonnage is anticipated to increase as new mines come on line and a previously idled plant resumes operations. However, utility coal will have to compete with continued low natural gas prices. Export coal tonnage increased 27% compared to 2009, reflecting increased global demand for coal used in steel production. Tonnage handled through Norfolk was up about 1.3 million tons, or 9%, and Baltimore tonnage handled increased about 3.5 million tons, or 97%. In 2009, export coal tonnage decreased 22% compared to 2008, reflecting the global recession, reduced demand for steel production and high inventory levels. Norfolk tonnage handled decreased about 3.1 million tons, or 18%, and Baltimore tonnage was down about 2.1 million tons, or 37%. For 2011, export coal tonnage is expected to increase in response to the impact of Australian flooding on global coal supply and the expected continuation of strong global demand for steel. Domestic metallurgical coal, coke, and iron ore tonnage increased 67% compared with 2009, as domestic steel production improved due to an increase in steel demand as blast furnaces resumed operations. In 2009, domestic metallurgical coal, coke, and iron ore tonnage decreased 35% compared with 2008, reflecting reduced demand for raw steel caused by the downturn in the U.S. economy which led to blast furnace outages, reduced coke production schedules, and high inventory levels. For 2011, domestic metallurgical coal, coke, and iron ore tonnage is expected to be flat compared to 2010. Other coal tonnage (principally steam coal shipped to industrial plants) increased 1% compared to 2009, primarily due to new business and increased demand in the steel market. In 2009, other coal tonnage decreased 12% compared to 2008, primarily due to reduced production at NS served plants caused by the downturn in the U.S. economy. For 2011, other coal tonnage is expected to be flat compared to 2010. GENERAL MERCHANDISE revenues in 2010 increased $826 million, or 20%, compared with 2009, reflecting a 14% increase in traffic volume and a 5% improvement in average revenue per unit, reflecting increased fuel surcharge revenue and higher rates. K23 In 2009, general merchandise revenues decreased $1.3 billion, or 24%, compared with 2008, reflecting a 21% decline in traffic volume and a 3% decrease in average revenue per unit, as higher rates were overshadowed by decreased fuel surcharge revenues. Agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues increased 12%, compared with 2009, due to an 11% increase in traffic volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per unit. The increase in traffic volume was a result of more shipments of sweeteners and corn due to continued strength in the demand for ethanol; higher fertilizer volumes due to farmers replenishing nutrients to meet increased crop demand; and, increased feed volumes due to a strong export market. In 2009, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues decreased 8%, compared with 2008. The revenue decline resulted from an 8% decrease in traffic volumes as plant closures and production curtailments led to fewer shipments of fertilizer and corn. For 2011, agriculture revenues are expected to improve as a result of increased volumes and higher average revenue per unit, reflecting expected growth in sweeteners and corn driven by gains in the ethanol market. Chemicals revenue in 2010 increased 23%, compared with 2009, due to an 18% increase in traffic volume and a 5% growth in average revenue per unit, reflecting higher rates and increased fuel surcharges. Volume gains reflected new business of fly ash in addition to higher shipments of petroleum, industrial intermediates, plastics, and miscellaneous chemicals resulting from improvements in the economy. In 2009, chemicals revenues decreased 15%, compared with 2008, due to a 12% decrease in traffic volume and a 3% decline in average revenue per unit, primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges. The decline in traffic volume was a result of continued weakness in housing construction which drove declines in industrial intermediates, plastics and miscellaneous chemicals. Volumes associated with pretroleum based products also declined as a result of reduced demand for asphalt and production curtailments. For 2011, chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase as higher average revenue per unit coupled with increased shipments of petroleum products, plastics, and industrial intermediates, which partially offset lower volumes of fly ash. Metals and construction revenues increased 36% in 2010, reflecting a 25% increase in traffic volume and a 9% increase in average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains and increased fuel surcharges. The increase in traffic volume was principally due to more shipments of coil, iron and steel, and scrap metal due to increased steel and automotive production, as well as higher shipments of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling. In 2009, metals and construction revenues decreased 40%, reflecting a 32% decrease in traffic volume and a 12% decline in average revenue per unit, primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges. The decline in traffic volume was principally due to lower coil, scrap metal, iron and steel shipments, in addition to reduced demand for construction materials as a result of continued weakness in the housing, infrastructure, and automotive sectors. For 2011, metals and construction revenues are expected to increase as a result of higher metal related traffic volumes due to increased domestic and global steel production, in addition to growth in the natural gas drilling sector. Additionally, average revenue per unit is expected to be higher. Paper, clay and forest products revenues increased 7% in 2010, compared with 2009. The improvement resulted from a 7% increase in traffic volumes, reflecting increased pulp board, pulp, kaolin, lumber, and newsprint shipments as a result of improvements in the domestic and global economics. In 2009, paper, clay, and forest products revenues decreased 26%, compared with 2008, due to a 22% decrease in traffic volumes and a 5% decline in average revenue per unit, primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges. The volume decline reflected lower pulp board, lumber, kaolin, printing paper, and wood chip shipments due to reduced U.S. paper production and the slowdown in the housing market. For 2011, paper, clay, and forest products revenues are expected to be modestly higher as increased average revenue per unit is expected to be offset in part by reduced shipments of woodchips, pulp board, kaolin, pulp, and newsprint due to customer sourcing changes and the continued weak demand for paper. K24 Automotive revenues rose 23%, compared to 2009. A network redesign that eliminated reloadings at mixing centers resulted in fewer carloads and higher revenue per unit. Approximately 33,200 carloads were eliminated in 2010 as a result of the design changes in the automotive network. This reduction in carloadings was completely offset by higher volumes associated with the 40% increased production of North American light vehicles. In 2009, automotive revenues decreased 36%, compared to 2008, reflecting lower traffic volumes and decreased average revenue per unit as fuel surcharges were lower. Volumes decreased 30%, primarily as a result of a 32% decrease in North American light vehicle production as manufacturers cut production in line with consumer demand. For 2011, automotive revenues are expected to increase, driven by volume gains due to a projected increase in North American light vehicle production, in addition to higher average revenue per unit related to rate increases from escalators and contract renegotiation. INTERMODAL revenues increased $266 million, or 17%, compared with 2009, reflecting a 16% increase in traffic volume and a 1% improvement in average revenue per unit. In 2010, all intermodal segments experienced volume increases, reflecting a steadily improving economy as well as an increase in market demand. Domestic volume (which includes truckload and intermodal marketing companies volumes) increased 27%; international traffic volume improved 7%; premium business, which includes parcel and less than truckload (LTL) carriers, increased 16%; and Triple Crown Services (Triple Crown), a service with rail to highway trailers, experienced a 5% growth in volume. In 2009, intermodal revenues decreased $528 million, or 26%, compared with 2008, reflecting a 16% reduction in traffic volume and an 11% decrease in average revenue per unit. In 2009, all intermodal segments experienced depressed volumes, reflecting the weak economy and lower consumer demand. International traffic volume declined 30%; premium business decreased 14%; Triple Crown experienced a 10% drop in volume; and domestic volume decreased less than 1%. For 2011, intermodal revenues are expected to increase due to higher average revenue per unit and volumes as a result of steadily improving economy and an increase in market demand. Railway Operating Expenses Railway operating expenses in 2010 were $6.8 billion, up $833 million, or 14% compared to 2009. Expenses in 2009 were $6 billion, down $1.6 billion, or 21% compared to 2008. The increase in 2010 was primarily due to increased volume related expenses and higher fuel prices. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to lower volume related expenses and lower fuel prices. The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses, improved to 71.9% in 2010, compared with 75.4% in 2009 and 71.1% in 2008. K25 The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications. Operating Expense Variances Increases (Decreases) 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 ($ in millions) Compensation and benefits $ 307 $ (283) Purchased services and rents 74 (196) Fuel 354 (913) Depreciation (18) 33 Materials and other 116 (211) Net Increase (Decrease) $ 833 $ (1,570) Compensation and benefits, which represents 40% of total operating expenses, increased $307 million, or 13% compared with 2009. The rise was principally the result of higher: employee activity levels associated with increased traffic volumes (up $88 million), health and welfare benefit costs for active and retired employees (up $67 million), wage rates (up $51 million), incentive and stock based compensation (up $48 million), pension expenses (up $30 million), and payroll taxes (up $19 million). In 2009, compensation and benefits decreased $283 million, or 11%, compared with 2008, primarily due to lower volume related payroll (down $217 million); reduced incentive and stock based compensation (down $117 million); the absence of the cost of lump sum payments due under the 2008 Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) agreement ($31 million); and, lower payroll taxes (down $26 million). These decreases were partially offset by increased wage rates (up $53 million); increased pension costs (up $42 million); and higher medical benefits (up $25 million). NS employment averaged 28,559 in 2010, compared with 28,593 in 2009 and 30,709 in 2008. Looking forward to 2011, NS expects employment levels to be more in line with 2008 employment levels and accordingly, increased compensation and benefits expenses as a result of anticipated volume increases and expected higher health and welfare benefit rates ($30 million) for agreement employees. Purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses increased $74 million, or 5%, in 2010 compared to 2009, but decreased $196 million, or 12%, in 2009 compared to 2008. Purchased services costs were $1.2 billion in 2010, $1.1 billion in 2009, and $1.2 billion in 2008. The increase in 2010 was driven by higher costs associated with volume related services. The decrease in 2009 reflected lower volume related expenses such as transportation operating costs (including automotive related costs and crew transportation expenses), intermodal operations costs, and mechanical and engineering expenses (largely because of reduced maintenance activities). These declines were offset in part by increased professional and legal services. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, amounted to $326 million, $316 million, and $357 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 was principally due to higher traffic volumes, whereas the decrease in 2009 was principally due to lower traffic volumes. K26 Fuel expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations, increased $354 million, or 49%, in 2010, compared with 2009, but decreased $913 million, or 56%, in 2009, compared with 2008. The increase in 2010 was principally the result of higher fuel prices (locomotive fuel prices increased 33%) which had an effect of $271 million, as well as increased fuel consumption (locomotive fuel consumption rose 12%) which had an effect of $83 million. The decline in 2009 reflected lower fuel prices, which had an impact of $600 million, and reduced fuel consumption, which had an impact of $313 million. In 2009, locomotive fuel prices declined 47%, and locomotive fuel consumption fell 19% in 2009. Depreciation expense decreased $18 million, or 2%, in 2010 compared to 2009, but increased $33 million, or 4%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in 2010 reflects lower depreciation rates resulting from the equipment study that was completed in the first quarter of 2010, which more than offset the effects of NS increased roadway and equipment capital base. The increase in 2009 was a reflection of substantial capital investments and improvements. Materials and other expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage, and environmental matters) increased $116 million, or 18%, in 2010 compared with 2009, but decreased $211 million, or 25%, in 2009 compared with 2008, as shown in the following table. 2010 2009 2008 ($ in millions) Materials $ 346 $ 309 $ 380 Casualties and other claims 142 102 180 Other 269 230 292 Total $ 757 $ 641 $ 852 The increase in 2010 reflected increased locomotive and roadway materials expenses, reduced favorable personal injury claims development, the absence of the $21 million favorable settlement of a multi year tax dispute that benefited 2009, and higher costs associated with supplies, employee travel, derailments, environmental remediation, and property taxes. The decrease in 2009 reflected lower locomotive, freight car, and roadway materials expenses, lower loss and damage claims, favorable personal injury claims development, reduced employee travel costs, a $21 million favorable adjustment related to settlement of a multi year state tax dispute, and the absence of the 2008 Avondale Mills settlement (see additional discussion below). In 2011, NS expects materials expenses for locomotive and railcar equipment to increase by approximately $55 million due to higher traffic volumes. In April 2008, NS settled the lawsuit brought by Avondale Mills for claims associated with the January 6, 2005 derailment in Graniteville, SC. A portion of the settlement was not reimbursed by insurance and was included in 2008 expenses. The total liability related to the derailment represents NS best estimate based on current facts and circumstances. The estimate includes amounts related to property damage, personal injury and response costs. NS commercial insurance policies are expected to cover substantially all expenses related to this derailment above the unreimbursed portion and NS self insured retention, including NS response costs and legal fees. The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect long term receivables for estimated recoveries from NS insurance carriers. NS engaged in arbitration with two of its insurance carriers that failed to respond to insurance claims submitted by NS. During the first quarter of 2010, NS settled the arbitration claim ($100 million) with one of the insurance carriers with no adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. The remaining insurance claim was arbitrated in December 2010. NS is currently awaiting a ruling from the a rbitration panel. NS believes that the arbitration panel will rule in favor of NS and recovery of the recorded receivables for the contested portion ($43 million) is probable. The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. Cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 44% of total employee injury cases resolved and about 31% of total employee injury payments made. With its long established commitment to safety, NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. With respect to occupational injuries, which are not caused by a specific accident or event but allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time, the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately. The majority of these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of the Federal Employers Li ability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads. FELAs fault based system, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no fault workers compensation system. K27 NS maintains substantial amounts of insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance (see Note 17). NS expects insurance costs to be slightly lower in 2011. Other Income Net Other income net was $153 million in 2010, $127 million in 2009, and $110 million in 2008 (see Note 2). The increase in 2010 reflected higher gains on the sale of property, including a $35 million gain on the sale of land to the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia and a $13 million favorable coal royalty settlement. These increases were offset in part by increased interest expense (net) on uncertain tax positions and other tax contingencies (which includes the absence of 2009 favorable resolution of prior years tax matters). The increase in 2009 reflected higher net returns from corporate owned life insurance (up $32 million) offset in part by fewer gains on the sale of property (down $11 million). Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2010 was $871 million, for an effective rate of 37%, compared with effective rates of 36% in 2009 and 38% in 2008. The increase in the rate for 2010 was primarily due to a $27 million charge to deferred tax expense due to a change in the tax law impacting the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy program, a lower benefit from Conrail equity, and an increase in state taxes, offset in part by a $34 million benefit resulting from a change in estimate related to NS deferred taxes. The decrease in the rate for 2009 was primarily due to improved net returns from corporate owned life insurance and the favorable resolution of state tax issues. Fifty percent bonus depreciation was allowed for federal income taxes for 2008 through 2010. In December 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act increased bonus depreciation to 100 percent for the period September 2010 through the end of 2011 and allows 50 percent bonus depreciation in 2012. Bonus depreciation does not have a material effect on NS total provision for income taxes or effective tax rate, but does significantly lower current tax expense and the related cash outflows for income taxes paid. NS consolidated federal income tax return for 2008 is being audited by the IRS. K28 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $2.7 billion in 2010 compared with $1.9 billion in 2009 and $2.7 billion in 2008. The increase in 2010 reflects the improvement in operating results, in addition to a reduction in working capital components. Operating cash flows in 2010 also benefited from the favorable settlement of an insurance claim related to the 2005 Graniteville derailment. The decline in 2009 reflected the $1.1 billion decrease in income from railway operations offset in part by lower income tax payments. NS had working capital of $389 million at December 31, 2010, compared with working capital of $457 million at December 31, 2009. NS portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances totaled $1.1 billion at both December 31, 2010 and 2009 and was invested in accordance with NS corporate investment policy as approved by the Board of Directors. &n bsp;The portfolio contains securities that are subject to market risk. There are no limits or restrictions on NS access to these assets. NS expects that cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2010, comprised of NS long term debt (including capital leases) (see Note 8), operating leases (see Note 9), agreements with CRC and long term advances from Conrail (see Note 5), unconditional purchase obligations (see Note 17), and unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 3), were as follows: 2012 2014 2016 and Total 2011 2013 2015 Subsequent Other Long term debt and capital lease principal $ 6,925 $ 358 $ 91 $ 446 $ 6,030 $ Operating leases 626 92 162 87 285 Agreements with CRC 407 30 60 60 257 Unconditional purchase obligations 956 507 255 138 46 10 Long term advances from Conrail 133 133 Unrecognized tax benefits* 124 42 82 Total $ 9,171 $ 1,029 $ 568 $ 731 $ 6,751 $ 92 * When the amount and timing of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits can be reasonably estimated, the amount is shown in the table under the appropriate period. When the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated, the amount is shown in the Other column. Off balance sheet arrangements consist of obligations related to operating leases, which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in Note 9. Cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion in both 2010 and 2009 and $1.2 billion in 2008. In 2010, additional capital expenditures were offset by lower net investment activity. The increase in 2009 primarily reflected lower proceeds from investment sales and higher investment purchases, offset in part by lower property additions. K29 Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending (including capital leases) and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. Capital Expenditures 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 ($ in millions) Roadway and all other property $ 1,153 $ 1,128 $ 1,070 $ 894 $ 756 Equipment 317 171 488 447 422 Total $ 1,470 $ 1,299 $ 1,558 $ 1,341 $ 1,178 Track Structure Statistics (Capital and Maintenance) 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Track miles of rail installed 422 434 459 401 327 Miles of track surfaced 5,326 5,568 5,209 5,014 4,871 New crossties installed (millions) 2.6 2.7 2.7 2.7 2.7 Average Age of Owned Railway Equipment 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 (years) Freight cars 31.0 30.3 29.9 30.1 30.0 Locomotives 20.5 19.9 18.9 18.1 17.7 Retired locomotives 28.4 31.2 34.4 30.0 35.0 For 2011, NS has budgeted $2.2 billion for capital expenditures. The anticipated spending includes $763 million for roadway projects, including the normalized replacement of rail, ties and ballast, and the improvement or replacement of bridges. Planned equipment spending of $701 million includes the acquisition of new locomotives, coal cars, grain covered hopper cars, and intermodal containers and chassis. Equipment spending also includes continued improvements to the locomotive fleet, including the rebuild and upgrade of existing units. Investments in facilities and terminals is anticipated to be $244 million, primarily for intermodal terminals and equipment to add capacity to the intermodal network, including the Crescent Corridor program of projects, and bulk transfer facilities and mechanical service shops. Technology investments of $96 million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers. NS also expects to spen d $79 million on infrastructure investments, including the MidAmerica and Crescent Corridors. NS has budgeted $146 million for 2011 for the continued implementation of positive train control and expects additional capital expenditures of at least $1 billion in the years 2012 through 2015. This includes upgrades to systems and track structure, required for the Federal Railroad Administration approved implementation of positive train control, that will be accelerated from future years spending to meet the 2015 legislative deadline. All capital expenditures are expected to be made with internally generated funds or proceeds from borrowings. K30 The CREATE project is a public private partnership to reduce rail and highway congestion and add freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan Chicago area. NS and other railroads have agreed to participate in CREATE. A portion of public funding has been approved. The CREATE partners have developed a list of projects to be included in Phase I of CREATE. A total of $91 million in federal funding has been secured for Phase I. The railroads have contributed an additional $116 million and expect to complete Phase I by the end of 2012. In addition, $133 million from the High Speed Rail Program and $100 million from the TIGER Stimulus Program have been committed to specific CREATE projects. The State of Illinois and City of Chicago have also committed $14 million in additional funding. As currently planned, the total CREATE project is estimated to cost $3.2 billion with city, state, and federal support.&nb sp; If additional public funding is secured, the railroads are expected to contribute a total of $171 million towards the entire project. NS expects to spend approximately $10 million in 2011 related to the CREATE projects. The Meridian Speedway is a 320 mile rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana. On May 1, 2006, NS and Kansas City Southern (KCS) formed a joint venture, Meridian Speedway LLC (MSLLC), pursuant to which NS agreed to contribute $300 million in cash, substantially all of which will be used for capital improvements in exchange for a 30% interest in the joint venture. To date, NS has contributed $283 million. At the formation of MSLLC, KCS contributed the Meridian Speedway. The joint venture increases capacity and is designed to improve service over the Meridian Speedway into the Southeast. Pan Am Southern LLC (PAS) is a railroad company joint venture in which NS and Pan Am Railways, Inc. (Pan Am) each has a 50% equity interest. As of December 31, 2010, NS has contributed cash and other property with a combined value of approximately $116 million and committed to contribute an additional $24 million in cash over the next two years. A significant portion of NS contributions has and will continue to be used for capital improvements to the PAS Lines and the related construction of new intermodal and automotive terminals. The Crescent Corridor consists of a program of projects for infrastructure and other facility improvements geared toward creating a seamless, high capacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from New Jersey to Louisiana and offering truck competitive service along several major interstate highway corridors, including I 81, I 85, I 20, I 40, I 59, I 78, and I 75. Based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief, NS plans to implement certain elements of the Crescent Corridor program of projects through a series of public private partnerships. Currently, the Crescent Corridor has received or expects to receive a total of $210 million in public capital funding commitments from the Commonwealths of Pennsylvania and Virginia, the states of Alabama and Tennessee, the federal TIGER Stimulus Program and other federal funding sources related to projects in Alabama, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and North Carolina. NS currently estimates spending up to $207 million for the substantial completion of work on these projects which is expected in 2012, including planned 2011 capital expenditures as high as $70 million. The MidAmerica Corridor is a proposed cooperative arrangement between NS and Canadian National Railway (CN) to effectively share track between Chicago, St. Louis, Kentucky, and Mississippi in order to establish more efficient routes for traffic moving between the midwestern and southeastern U.S., including potential coal traffic moving to NS served southeastern utility plants from CN served Illinois Basin coal producers. To implement the MidAmerica Corridor, NS will continue to expend funds to upgrade the rail line operated by West Tennessee Railway between Fulton, Kentucky, and Corinth, Mississippi, a line over which NS would operate pursuant to recently obtained trackage rights. In addition, NS will construct a connection with CN east of St. Louis. Implementation of the MidAmerica corridor arrangement will begin in 2011 with the start of a daily train between St. Louis and the Southeast. Projected capital improvements for 2011 are expected to be a pproximately $17 million. K31 Cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion 2010, compared with $31 million in 2009, and $1.1 billion in 2008. The change in 2010 reflected the resumed repurchase and retirement of Common Stock as part of NS share repurchase program, in addition to lower borrowings, net of debt repayments. The change in 2009 reflected the absence of share repurchase activity and higher borrowings net of debt repayments that were offset in part by fewer exercises of employee stock options and increased dividends. Share repurchases totaled $863 million in 2010, zero in 2009, and $1.1 billion in 2008 for the purchase and retirement of 14.7 million, zero, and 19.4 million shares, respectively. On July 27, 2010, NS Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of Common Stock through December 31, 2014. The timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by managements assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors. Any near term purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash or proceeds from borrowings. During the third quarter 2010, NS issued $250 million of unsecured notes at 6.00% due 2105. As of December 31, 2010, NS has authority from its Board of Directors to issue an additional $1 billion of debt or equity securities through public or private sale. NS has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Form S 3 automatic shelf registration statement for well known seasoned issuers under which securities may be issued pursuant to this authority. NS also has in place and available a $1 billion, five year credit agreement expiring in 2012, which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants. NS had no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2010, and NS is in compliance with all of its covenants. In October 2010, NS renewed its $350 million accounts receivable securitization program with a 364 day term to run until October 2011. There was $200 million outstanding under this program at December 31, 2010 (see Note 8). Looking forward, NS annual debt maturities are relatively modest (see Note 8). Overall, NS goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support NS business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require management to make changes to these estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management regularly discusses the development, selection, and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the Aud it Committee of its Board of Directors. K32 Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions (see Note 11). These include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans assets, projected increases in medical costs, and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality. In addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value. Management makes these estimates based on the companys historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance). Management utilizes an independent consulting actuarial firms studies to assist it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities. NS net pension expense, which is included in Compensation and benefits in its Consolidated Statements of Income, was $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. In recording this amount, NS assumed a long term investment rate of return of 8.75%, which was supported by the long term total rate of return on plan assets since inception. A one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $16 million change in pension expense, and, as a result, an equal change in Compensation and benefits expense. Changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on NS net pension expense or net pension liability in the future. The net pension liability is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments. NS utilizes analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high quality corporate bonds. NS uses the results of the yield curves to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans. NS net cost for other postretirement benefits, which is also included in Compensation and benefits, was $114 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. In recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits, which is included in Other postretirement benefits, management estimated future increases in health care costs. These assumptions, along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them, are described in Note 11. Properties and Depreciation Most of NS total assets are long lived railway properties (see Note 6). As disclosed in Note 1, NS properties are depreciated using group depreciation. The primary depreciation method for NS asset base is group life. Units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources. Remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straight line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives. NS depreciation expense is based on managements assumptions concerning expected service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement. In developing these assumptions, NS management utilizes periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an independent outside firm of consulting engineers and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (STB), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. NS depreciation studies are conducted every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets and other roadway property. The frequency of these studies correlates with guidelines established by the STB. Key factors which are considered in developing average service life and salvage estimates include: Statistical analysis of historical retirement data and surviving asset records; Review of historical salvage received and current market rates; Review of NS operations including expected changes in technology, customer demand, maintenance practices and asset management strategies; Review of accounting policies and assumptions; and Industry review and analysis. The units of production depreciation rate for rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross ton miles as compared to the total or ultimate capacity of rail in these corridors. NS experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in determination of the expected service life of rail in high density corridors. In developing the respective depreciation rate, consideration is also given to several rail characteristics including age, weight, condition (new or second hand) and type (curve or tangent). As a result, a composite depreciation rate is developed which is applied to the depreciable base. NS recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties, these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense. Changes in rates as a result of depreciation studies are implemented prospectively. These studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property, as determined by the study. NS depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, amounted to $819 million. NS composite depreciation rates for 2010 are disclosed in Note 6; a one tenth percentage point increase (or decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a $30 million increase (or decrease) to depreciation expense.&nb sp; For 2010, roadway depreciation rates ranged from 0.83% to 33.3% and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 1.32% to 37.84%. K33 When properties other than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized in earnings. Actual historical cost values are retired when available, such as with equipment assets. The use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the impracticality of tracking individual asset costs. When retiring rail, ties, and ballast, NS uses statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired. The historical cost of other roadway assets is estimated using a combination of inflation indices specific to the rail industry and those published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets. These indices are used because they closely c orrelate with the costs of roadway assets. Gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in Other income net (see Note 2) since such income is not a product of NS railroad operations. A retirement is considered abnormal if it does not occur in the normal course of business, if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies, which inherently consider the impact of normal retirements on expected service lives and depreciation rates. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recognized in earnings. There were no gains or losses recognized in 2010, 2009, or 2008, due to abnormal retirement of depreciable railroad property. NS reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flow. Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value. Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities NS expense for casualties and other claims, included in Materials and other, amounted to $142 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Most of this expense was NS accrual related to personal injury liabilities. Job related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to railroads. FELAs fault based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no fault workers compensation system. The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded. In all cases, NS records a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable. To aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period, NS management utilizes studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm. For employee personal injury cases, the actuarial firm studies NS historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences. An estimate of the the ultimate amount of the liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims, is based on the results of this analysis. For occupational injury claims, the actuarial firm studies NS history of claim filings, severity, payments and other relevant facts. Additionally, the estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting NS experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined. NS has recorded this actu arially determined liability. The liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic studies. Accordingly, there could be significant changes in the liability, which NS would recognize when such a change became known. While actuarial studies reflected favorable claims development between 2008 and 2009 (resulting in a decrease of the annual cost related to personal injuries from $78 million to $51 million), a reduced level of favorable development in 2010 resulted in an increase in the annual cost related to personal injuries to $75 million in 2010 from $51 million in 2009. While the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study, it is possible that the ultimate liability could be higher or lower. NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably (see Note 17). Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS, are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $26 million in 2010, $20 million in 2009, and $18 million in 2008, and capital expenditures for environmental matters totaled approximately $8 million in 2010, $11 million in 2009, and $7 million in 2008. Capital expenditures for environmental matters in 2011 are expected to be about $9 million. NS Consolidated Balance Sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $33 million at December 31, 2010, and $32 million at December 31, 2009 (of which $12 million is classified as a current liability at the end of each period). At December 31, 2010, the liability represents NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 143 known locations. As of that date, 11 sites accounted for $15 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At 32 locations, one or more NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statues, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. K34 With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. NS estimates its environmental remediation liability on a site by site basis, using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site. As a result, it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments. NS has consistently applied i ts methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities. Based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, management believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which NS is aware. Further, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations. When management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to expenses. While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments, in managements opinion the recorded liability, if any, is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims. However, the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter. Any adjustments to recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known. Income Taxes NS net long term deferred tax liability totaled $7.1 billion at December 31, 2010 (see Note 3). This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns. For state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized. NS had a $21 million valuation allowance on $823 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2010, reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized. During 2010, NS performed a review and re evaluation of its estimates for deferred tax ass ets and liabilities, resulting in a reduction of income tax expense of $34 million. In addition, NS has a recorded liability for its estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. Management believes this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded. For every one half percent change in the 2010 effective tax rate, net income would have changed by $12 million. K35 OTHER MATTERS Labor Agreements More than 80% of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (RLA). NS largely bargains nationally in concert with other major railroads. Moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may propose changes. On or after November 1, 2009, NS and the nations other major railroads represented by the National Carriers Conference Committee (NCCC) served new proposals to begin the current round of bargaining. The NCCC and a coalition of six unions led by the Transportation Communications Union (TCU) are currently negotiating with the assistance of a mediator from the National Mediation Board. On January 12, 2011, the National Mediation Board accepted the application for mediation filed on behalf of the Rail Labor Bargaining Coalition, representing six labor organizations in national bargaining, and a mediator has been assigned. The outcome of any of the negotiations cannot be determined at this point. The current agreements with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) and the American Train Dispatchers Association (ATDA) extend through 2014. Because NS has reached separate agreements with the BLET and the ATDA, only the health and welfare provisions from the national agreements apply to NS locomotive engineers and ATDA represented dispatchers. NS bargains separately with longshoremen, who are represented by the International Longshoremens Association (ILA), at Ashtabula (Ohio) Docks and do not participate in national bargaining. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio. At December 31, 2010, NS debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $200 million. A 1% point increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $2 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. At December 31, 2010, NS did not have fixed rate capital leases that were converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2009, some of NS capital leases, which carried an average fixed rate of 7%, were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements. On December 31, 2009, the average pay rate under these agreements was 1%, and the average receive rate was 6%. During 2010 and 2009, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by less than $1 million in both periods. A portion of the lease obligation was payable in Japanese yen. NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen denominated obligation. Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese. As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan. & nbsp;Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy. Inflation In preparing financial statements, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such property. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. K36 Proposed Legislation and Regulations on Safety and Transportation of Hazardous Materials Federal regulations were adopted in late 2008 on safety and transportation of hazardous materials. NS is in compliance with those regulations. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like believe, expect, anticipate, and project. Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: legislative and regulatory developments; transportation of hazardous materials as a common carrier by rail; acts of terrorism or war; general economic conditions; impacts of environmental regulations on utility coal customers and or the value of certain NS assets; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; the operations of carriers with which NS interchanges; disruptions to NS technology infrastructure, including computer systems; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; commercial, operating, environmental, and climate change legislative and regulatory developments; results of litigation; natural events such as severe weather, hurricanes, and floods; unavailability of qualified personnel due to unpredictability of demand for rail services; fluctuation in supplies a nd prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; and changes in securities and capital markets. For a discussion of significant risk factors applicable to NS, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guarantee of future performance or results, nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. NS undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. Item 7A.
