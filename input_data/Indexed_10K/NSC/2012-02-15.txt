Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Norfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and the Selected Financial Data. OVERVIEW With global and domestic economies reflecting pent up demand, NS net income grew for the second consecutive year. NS 2011 net income rose 28% as a result of a 20% increase in income from railway operations and a lower effective income tax rate. Railway operating revenues increased 17% as a result of higher average revenue per unit (including fuel surcharges) and increased traffic volume. Railway operating expenses increased 16%, reflecting higher fuel prices and increased traffic volume. The railway operating ratio (a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses) improved to 71.2%, as compared with 71.9% in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.2 billion which, along with cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings allowed for property additions, share repurchases, debt repayments, and dividend payments. During 2011, 30.2 million shares of Common Stock were repurchased at a total cost of $2.1 billion. Since inception of the stock repurchase program in 2006, NS has repurchased and retired 109.6 million shares of Common Stock at a total cost of $6.2 billion. At December 31, 2011, cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments totaled $301 million. Looking forward to 2012, NS expects revenues to increase, reflecting higher traffic volumes but at a more moderate pace than seen in 2011 given the slow growing economy, and higher average revenue per unit that will meet or slightly exceed the rate of rail inflation. NS plans to continue to focus on safety, improving service levels and operational efficiency, and maintaining a market based approach to pricing. SUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2011 Compared with 2010 Net income in 2011 was $1.9 billion, or $5.45 per diluted share, up $420 million, or 28%, compared with $1.5 billion, or $4.00 per diluted share, in 2010. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations and a lower effective tax rate (see Note 3). Railway operating revenues increased $1.7 billion, reflecting higher average revenue per unit, including fuel surcharges, and higher traffic volumes. Railway operating expenses increased$1.1 billion, principally due to higher fuel prices and volume related expenses. Oil prices affect NS results of operations in a variety of ways and can have an overall favorable or unfavorable impact in any particular period. In addition to the impact of oil prices on general economic conditions and traffic volume, oil prices directly affect NS revenues through market based fuel surcharges and contract escalators (see Railway Operating Revenues) and also affect fuel costs (see Railway Operating Expenses). For 2011, excluding the impact of increased consumption, the increase in fuel surcharge revenue was greater than the increase in fuel expense. Future changes in oil prices may cause volatility in operating results that could be material to a particular year or quarter. 2010 Compared with 2009 Net income in 2010 was $1.5 billion, or $4.00 per diluted share, up $462 million, or 45%, compared with $1.0 billion, or $2.76 per diluted share, in 2009. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations that was offset in part by higher income taxes (see Note 3). Railway operating revenues increased $1.5 billion, reflecting higher traffic volumes and higher average revenue per unit, including fuel surcharges. Railway operating expenses increased $833 million, primarily due to higher volume related expenses and fuel prices. K19 DETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Railway Operating Revenues Railway operating revenues were $11.2 billion in 2011, $9.5 billion in 2010, and $8.0 billion in 2009. The following table presents a three year comparison of revenues, volumes, and average revenue per unit by market group. Revenues Units Revenue per Unit 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 ($ in millions) (in thousands) ($ per unit) Coal $ 3,458 $ 2,719 $ 2,264 1,619.6 1,556.7 1,418.5 $ 2,135 $ 1,747 $ 1,596 General merchandise: Agr./consumer/govt. 1,439 1,326 1,181 599.4 627.7 563.3 2,400 2,113 2,097 Chemicals 1,368 1,302 1,056 373.7 406.1 345.0 3,662 3,207 3,061 Metals/construction 1,241 1,013 745 665.0 628.4 504.2 1,867 1,612 1,478 Automotive 780 648 527 332.2 290.4 289.4 2,348 2,232 1,821 Paper/clay/forest 756 712 666 314.3 327.7 306.4 2,404 2,171 2,172 General merchandise 5,584 5,001 4,175 2,284.6 2,280.3 2,008.3 2,444 2,193 2,079 Intermodal 2,130 1,796 1,530 3,210.5 2,927.1 2,530.5 663 614 605 Total $ 11,172 $ 9,516 $ 7,969 7,114.7 6,764.1 5,957.3 $ 1,570 $ 1,407 $ 1,338 Revenues increased $1.7 billion in 2011 and $1.5 billion in 2010. As reflected in the table below, the increase in 2011 was due to higher average revenue per unit (which was driven by rate increases and higher fuel surcharges, offset in part by the effects of changes in the mix of traffic) and increased traffic volumes. The increase in 2010 was due to increased traffic volumes and higher average revenue per unit, which was driven by higher fuel surcharges and rate increases, offset in part by the effects of changes in the mix of traffic. Fuel surcharge revenue amounted to $1.3 billion in 2011, compared with $724 million in 2010, and $370 million in 2009. If fuel prices remain at or near year end 2011 levels, fuel surcharge revenue will be higher in 2012. Many of NS negotiated fuel surcharges for coal and general merchandise traffic are based on the monthly average price of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI Average Price). These surcharges are reset the first day of each calendar month based on the WTI Average Price for the second preceding calendar month. This two month lag in applying WTI Average Price decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately $44 million in 2011, $28 million in 2010, and$50 million in 2009. Revenue Variance Analysis Increases 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 ($ in millions) Revenue per unit $ 1,163 $ 468 Traffic volume (units) 493 1,079 Total $ 1,656 $ 1,547 K20 For 2011, the favorable revenue per unit variance accounted for 70% of the total revenues increase, reflecting higher rates and increased fuel surcharges, offset in part by the effects of changes in the mix of traffic. The favorable volume variance reflected increases for all commodity groups except chemicals, agriculture/consumer products/government, and paper/clay/forest products driven primarily by increased consumer demand. In 2010, the favorable volume variance accounted for 70% of the total revenues increase, reflecting traffic volume improvements in all commodity groups. Volumes increased by 806,800 units, or 14%, reflecting the strengthening of the economy. The favorable revenue per unit variance reflected increased fuel surcharges and higher rates, offset in part by the effects of changes in the mix of traffic. Two of NS customers, DuPont and South Mississippi Electric Power Association (SMEPA), filed rate reasonableness complaints at the Surface Transportation Board (STB) alleging that the NS tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable. NS disputes these allegations, however, in August 2011, NS agreed to settle the rate reasonableness complaint with SMEPA. Settlement of this claim did not have a material effect on NS financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. Since June 1, 2009, in the case of DuPont, NS has been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates. Management presently expects resolution of the DuPont case to occur in 2013 and believes the estimate of reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on NS financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. With regard to rate cases, management records adjustments to revenues in the periods, if and when, such adjustments are probable and estimable. COAL revenues increased $739 million, or 27%, compared with 2010, reflecting higher average revenue per unit and a 4% increase in volume principally due to a rise in domestic and global steel production. Coal average revenue per unit was up 22%, reflecting improved pricing and increased fuel surcharge revenue. In 2010, coal revenues increased $455 million, or 20%, compared with 2009, reflecting higher average revenue per unit and a 10% increase in volume principally due to a rise in domestic and global steel production. Coal average revenue per unit was up 9% compared with 2009, reflecting increased fuel surcharge revenue and improved pricing. For 2012, coal revenues are expected to increase due to higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing improvement, in addition to increased volumes as a result of more shipments of export coal. Coal represented 31% of NS revenues in 2011 and 80% of shipments handled originated on NS lines. As shown in the following table, tonnage increased in three of the four coal markets. Coal Tonnage by Market 2011 2010 2009 (tons in thousands) Utility 122,004 120,737 120,278 Export 28,461 22,750 17,885 Domestic metallurgical 19,702 19,771 11,848 Industrial 7,713 7,573 7,509 Total 177,880 170,831 157,520 Utility coal tonnage improved a modest 1% in 2011, primarily a result of new business and the resumption in the first quarter of shipments to electrical generation units that had been idled since the first quarter of 2009. These increases were tempered by the effects of increased natural gas generation due to low natural gas prices, reduced electrical demand in NS served regions, and severe weather disruptions in 2011. K21 In 2010, utility coal tonnage improved slightly as residential demand increased due to severe winter weather and above average summer temperatures on the East Coast. Additionally, electricity demand in the industrial sector was higher. These increases more than offset the effects of low natural gas prices and the diversion of utility coal to the export market. For 2012, we expect utility coal tonnage to decrease, as new business gains will be more than offset by the effects of reduced electricity demand as a result of very mild winter weather conditions and low natural gas prices. Export coal tonnage increased 25% compared to 2010, reflecting increased global demand for coal used in steel production and tightened supply from Australia due to flooding in the first half of 2011. Tonnage handled through Norfolk was up 4.7 million tons, or 30%, and Baltimore tonnage handled increased 0.8 million tons, or 11%. In 2010, export coal tonnage increased 27% compared with 2009, reflecting increased global demand for coal used in steel production. Tonnage handled through Norfolk was up 1.3 million tons, or 9%, and Baltimore tonnage handled increased 3.5 million tons, or 97%. For 2012, export coal tonnage is expected to increase due to port capacity improvement projects, new coal production driven by planned mine expansions and worldwide demand, and new steam coal opportunities to Europe and Asia. Domestic metallurgical coal tonnage was flat in 2011 compared with 2010. In 2010, domestic metallurgical coal tonnage increased 67% compared with 2009, as domestic steel production improved due to an increase in steel demand as blast furnaces resumed operations. For 2012, domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to decrease as greater coking coal availability in the second half of 2011 led to inventory replenishment in late 2011 and anticipated lesser 2012 demand for domestic metallurgical coal. Industrial coal tonnage increased 2% in 2011, compared with 2010, as new business completely offset the impact of tight coal supply and network delays experienced in the early part of the year. In 2010, industrial coal tonnage increased 1% compared to 2009, primarily due to new business and increased demand in the steel market. For 2012, new business is expected to drive increases in industrial coal tonnage. GENERAL MERCHANDISE revenues in 2011 increased $583 million, or 12%, compared with 2010, reflecting an 11% rise in average revenue per unit as a result of higher rates and increased fuel surcharges. Overall, traffic volume was relatively flat. In 2010, general merchandise revenues increased $826 million, or 20%, compared with 2009, reflecting a 14% increase in traffic volume and a 5% improvement in average revenue per unit, reflecting increased fuel surcharge revenue and higher rates. Agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues increased 9% in 2011, compared with 2010, the result of 14% higher average revenue per unit, which reflected increased rates and higher fuel surcharges. Traffic volume declined 5% as a result of fewer shipments of fertilizer due to certain network classification changes and reduced shipments of corn to the Midwest due to the impact of a healthier Midwest crop. In 2010, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues increased 12%, compared with 2009, due to an 11% increase in traffic volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per unit. The increase in traffic volume was a result of: more shipments of sweeteners and corn due to continued strength in the demand for ethanol; higher fertilizer volumes due to farmers replenishing nutrients to meet increased crop demand; and increased feed volumes due to a strong export market. For 2012, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues are expected to improve as a result of increased volumes and higher average revenue per unit, reflecting projected growth driven by gains in the ethanol market in addition to more feed product and corn shipments due to slightly improved demand for animal feed. K22 Chemicals revenues in 2011 increased 5%, compared with 2010, as a 14% increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from increased rates and higher fuel surcharges more than offset the effects of an 8% decrease in traffic volume. The decline in volume was primarily a result of reduced shipments of fly ash due to the completion of the Tennessee Valley Authority ash project in the fourth quarter of 2010. In 2010, chemicals revenue increased 23%, compared with 2009, due to an 18% increase in traffic volume and a 5% growth in average revenue per unit, reflecting higher rates and increased fuel surcharges. Volume gains reflected new business of fly ash in addition to higher shipments of petroleum, industrial intermediates, plastics, and miscellaneous chemicals resulting from improvements in the economy. For 2012, chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase as a result of higher shipments of crude oil from the Midwest destined for eastern refineries and more carloads of liquefied petroleum gas as a previously idled refinery restarts. Improvements in the economy are also expected to generate higher plastic volumes. Additionally, average revenue per unit is expected to be higher. Metals and construction revenues increased 23% in 2011, compared with 2010. The revenue improvement resulted from 16% higher average revenue per unit, which reflected increased rates and higher fuel surcharges. Traffic volume improved 6% reflecting increased automotive production that led to more shipments of coil steel, and more shipments of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling. In 2010, metals and construction revenues increased 36%, reflecting a 25% increase in traffic volume and a 9% increase in average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains and increased fuel surcharges. The increase in traffic volume was principally due to more shipments of coil, iron and steel, and scrap metal due to increased steel and automotive production, as well as higher shipments of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling. For 2012, metals and construction revenues are expected to be modestly higher reflecting continued growth in the natural gas drilling sector and higher metal related traffic volumes due to increased domestic and global steel production. Additionally, average revenue per unit is expected to be higher. Automotive revenues rose 20%, compared to 2010, reflecting a 14% increase in traffic volume due to increased domestic production of North American light vehicles and a 5% improvement in average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains and increased fuel surcharges. In 2010, automotive revenues rose 23%, compared to 2009. A network redesign that eliminated reloadings at mixing centers resulted in fewer carloads and higher revenue per unit. Approximately 33,200 carloads were eliminated in 2010 as a result of the design changes in the automotive network. This reduction in carloadings was completely offset by higher volumes associated with the 40% increase in production of North American light vehicles. For 2012, automotive revenues are expected to modestly increase as a result of volume gains driven by an increase in domestic production of North American light vehicles at plants served by NS, in addition to higher average revenue per unit related to rate increases from escalators and contract renegotiations. Paper, clay and forest products revenues increased 6% in 2011, compared with 2010, reflecting an 11% improvement in average revenue per unit due to increased rates and higher fuel surcharges, which more than offset the effects of the 4% traffic volume decline. The decline in volume was principally due to fewer shipments of wood chips as dryer weather in the Southeast prompted customer sourcing changes, in addition to the closure of a plant in the third quarter of 2011. Reduced shipments of kaolin and newsprint associated with lower demand and the loss of some lower rated business also impacted the year. In 2010, paper, clay, and forest products revenues increased 7%, compared with 2009. The improvement resulted from a 7% increase in traffic volumes, a reflection of increased pulp board, pulp, kaolin, lumber, and newsprint shipments as a result of improvements in the domestic and global economies. For 2012, paper, clay, and forest products revenues are expected to be slightly higher as increased average revenue per unit is expected to be partially offset by reduced volumes as demand stays soft. K23 INTERMODAL revenues increased $334 million, or 19%, compared with 2010, reflecting a 10% increase in traffic volume and an 8% improvement in average revenue per unit as a result of higher fuel surcharges and increased rates. In 2011, all intermodal segments experienced volume increases, reflecting a steadily improving economy as well as tight truck capacity. Domestic volume (which includes truckload and intermodal marketing companies volumes) increased 15%; international traffic volume improved 5%; premium business, which includes parcel and less than truckload (LTL) carriers, increased 9%; and Triple Crown Services (Triple Crown), a service with rail to highway trailers, experienced a 1% growth in volume. In 2010, intermodal revenues increased $266 million, or 17%, compared with 2009, reflecting a 16% increase in traffic volume and a 1% improvement in average revenue per unit. In 2010, all intermodal segments experienced volume increases, reflecting a steadily improving economy as well as an increase in market demand. Domestic volume increased 27%; international traffic volume improved 7%; premium business increased 16%; and Triple Crown experienced a 5% growth in volume. For 2012, intermodal revenues are expected to increase due to higher traffic volume and average revenue per unit as a result of an increase in market demand and a steadily improving economy. Railway Operating Expenses Railway operating expenses in 2011 were $8.0 billion, up $1.1 billion, or 16% compared to 2010. Expenses in 2010 were $6.8 billion, up $833 million, or 14% compared to 2009. The increase in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to higher fuel prices and increased volume related expenses, while 2011 also reflected a $58 million unfavorable arbitration ruling. The railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses, improved to 71.2% in 2011, compared with 71.9% in 2010 and 75.4% in 2009. The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications. Operating Expense Variances Increases (Decrease) 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 ($ in millions) Fuel $ 510 $ 354 Compensation and benefits 266 307 Materials and other 167 116 Purchased services and rents 133 74 Depreciation 43 (18) Net Increase $ 1,119 $ 833 Fuel expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations, increased $510 million, or 47%, in 2011, and increased $354 million, or 49%, in 2010. The increase in 2011 was principally the result of higher fuel prices (locomotive fuel prices rose 37%) which had an impact of $431 million, as well as increased fuel consumption (locomotive fuel consumption grew 8%) which had an impact of $79 million. The increase in 2010 reflected higher fuel prices (locomotive fuel prices increased 33%) which had an effect of $271 million, as well as increased fuel consumption (locomotive fuel consumption rose 12%) which had an effect of$83 million. K24 Compensation and benefits, which represents 37% of total operating expenses, increased $266 million, or 10%, in 2011. The rise was principally the result of higher: agreement employee activity levels associated with increased traffic volumes (up $70 million), agreement health and welfare benefit costs for active employees (up $50 million), incentive compensation (up $39 million), payroll taxes (up $37 million), pension expenses (up $19 million), and wage rates (up $16 million). In 2010, compensation and benefits increased $307 million, or 13%, compared with 2009, primarily due to higher employee activity levels associated with increased traffic volumes (up $88 million); increased health and welfare benefit costs for active and retired employees (up $67 million); increased wage rates (up $51 million); higher incentive and stock based compensation (up $48 million); increased pension expenses (up $30 million); and higher payroll taxes (up $19 million). NS employment averaged 30,329 in 2011, compared with 28,559 in 2010, and 28,593 in 2009. The 2011 increase was a result of higher volume demands during the year. Looking forward to 2012, NS expects employment levels to be higher than 2011. Accordingly, NS also expects increased compensation and benefits costs as a result of anticipated volume increases and NS emphasis on service, in addition to higher health and welfare benefit costs and wage rates. Materials and other expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage, and environmental matters) increased $167 million, or 22%, in 2011 and increased $116 million, or 18%, in 2010, as shown in the following table. 2011 2010 2009 ($ in millions) Materials $ 408 $ 346 $ 309 Casualties and other claims 216 142 102 Other 300 269 230 Total $ 924 $ 757 $ 641 The increase in 2011 reflected the unfavorable arbitration ruling discussed below and higher costs associated with locomotive and railcar materials, taxes (primarily sales and use, property, and excise), and employee travel. The increase for 2011 also reflected less favorable personal injury claims development and higher supply costs. The increase in 2010 reflected increased locomotive and roadway materials expenses, reduced level of favorable personal injury claims development, the absence of the $21 million favorable settlement of a multi year state tax dispute that benefited 2009, and higher costs associated with supplies, employee travel, derailments, environmental remediation, and property taxes. The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect long term receivables for estimated recoveries from NS insurance carriers for claims associated with the January 6, 2005, derailment in Graniteville, S.C. In the first quarter of 2011, NS received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitration claim with an insurance carrier, and was denied recovery of the contested portion ($43 million) of the claim. As a result, NS recorded a $43 million charge during the first quarter of 2011 for the receivables associated with the contested portion of the claim and a $15 million charge for other receivables affected by the ruling for which recovery is no longer probable. During the first quarter of 2010, NS settled an arbitration claim ($100 million) with another insurance carrier with no adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. K25 The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs. Cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 44% of total employee injury cases resolved and about 31% of total employee injury payments made. With its long established commitment to safety, NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs. With respect to occupational injuries, which are not caused by a specific accident or event but allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time, the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately. The majority of these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades. The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job related accidental injury and occupational claims because of the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads. FELAs fault based system, which covers employee claims for job related injuries, produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no fault workers compensation system. NS maintains substantial amounts of insurance for potential third party liability and property damage claims. It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self insurance (see Note 16). Purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals. This category of expenses increased $133 million, or 9%, in 2011 and increased $74 million, or 5%, in 2010. Purchased services costs were $1.3 billion in 2011, $1.2 billion in 2010, and $1.1 billion in 2009. The increases in 2011 and 2010 were principally driven by higher costs associated with higher volumes. Equipment rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, amounted to $338 million, $326 million, and$316 million for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The increases in 2011 and 2010 were principally due to higher traffic volumes. Depreciation expense increased $43 million, or 5%, in 2011, but decreased $18 million, or 2%, in 2010. The increase in 2011 reflects NS larger roadway and equipment capital base as NS continues to invest in its infrastructure. The decrease in 2010 reflected lower depreciation rates that resulted from an equipment study that was completed in the first quarter of 2010 which more than offset the effects of NS larger roadway and equipment capital base. Other Income Net Other income net was $160 million in 2011, $153 million in 2010, and $127 million in 2009 (see Note 2). The increase in 2011 reflected reduced interest expense (net) on uncertain tax positions (down $9 million), higher net corporate owned life insurance returns (up $7 million), and increased coal royalties (up $6 million). The increases were offset in part by fewer gains on the sale of property (down $9 million) and increased professional and legal fees associated with the third quarter debt exchange and the fourth quarter credit facility renewal (up $7 million). The increase in 2010 reflected higher gains on the sale of property, including a $35 million gain on the sale of land to the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia and a $13 million favorable coal royalty settlement. These increases were offset in part by increased interest expense (net) on uncertain tax positions and other tax contingencies (which includes the absence of 2009 favorable resolution of prior years tax matters). Income Taxes Income tax expense in 2011 was $1 billion, for an effective rate of 34%, compared with effective rates of 37% in 2010 and 36% in 2009. The decrease in the rate for 2011 was primarily due to the favorable resolution of an IRS examination of NS 2008 return and review of certain claims for refund ($40 million), a decrease in deferred tax expense for state tax law changes ($28 million), and the absence of a first quarter 2010 charge to deferred tax expense ($27 million) due to a change in the tax law impacting the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy program. These decreases were offset in part by the absence of a fourth quarter 2010 $34 million benefit resulting from a change in estimate related to NS deferred taxes. The increase in the rate for 2010 was primarily due to the Medicare related charge, a lower benefit from Conrail equity, and an increase in state taxes, offset in part by the $34 million deferred tax benefit mentioned above. K26 Fifty percent bonus depreciation was allowed for federal income taxes for 2008 through 2010. In December 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act increased bonus depreciation to 100 percent for the period September 2010 through the end of 2011 and allows 50 percent bonus depreciation in 2012. Bonus depreciation does not affect NS total provision for income taxes or effective tax rate, but does significantly lower current tax expense and the related cash outflows for income taxes paid. NS consolidated income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 are undergoing routine audit by the IRS. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash provided by operating activities, NS principal source of liquidity, was $3.2 billion in 2011 compared with$2.7 billion in 2010 and $1.9 billion in 2009. The improvement in 2011 reflects better operating results and lower income taxes paid due to additional bonus depreciation. The increase in 2010 reflected improved operating results, in addition to a reduction in working capital components. Operating cash flows in 2010 also benefited from the favorable settlement of an insurance claim related to the 2005 Graniteville derailment. NS had working capital of $50 million at December 31, 2011, compared with working capital of $389 million at December 31, 2010, reflecting a lower cash balance offset in part by lower current maturities of long term debt as no senior notes will mature in 2012. NS portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances totaled $301 million and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and was invested in accordance with NS corporate investment policy as approved by the Board of Directors. The portfolio contains securities that are subject to market risk. There are no limits or restrictions on NS access to these assets. NS expects that cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2011, comprised of NS long term debt (including capital leases) (see Note 8), operating leases (see Note 9), agreements with CRC and long term advances from Conrail (see Note 5), unconditional purchase obligations (see Note 16), and unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 3), were as follows: 2013 2015 2017 and Total 2012 2014 2016 Subsequent Other ($ in millions) Long term debt and capital lease principal $ 7,440 $ 50 $ 492 $ 501 $ 6,397 $ Operating leases 585 96 156 72 261 Agreements with CRC 408 33 66 66 243 Unconditional purchase obligations 603 294 252 23 34 Long term advances from Conrail 133 133 Unrecognized tax benefits* 105 38 67 Total $ 9,274 $ 511 $ 966 $ 662 $ 7,068 $ 67 * When the amount and timing of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits can be reasonably estimated, the amount is shown in the table under the appropriate period. When the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated, the amount is shown in the Other column. Off balance sheet arrangements consist of obligations related to operating leases, which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in Note 9. K27 Cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion in 2011 and $1.5 billion in both 2010 and 2009. The increase in 2011 reflects higher property additions, offset in part by a decrease in investment purchases. In 2010, higher property additions were offset by lower net investment activity. Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category. The following tables show capital spending (including capital leases) and track and equipment statistics for the past five years. Property Additions 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 ($ in millions) Road and other property $ 1,222 $ 1,153 $ 1,128 $ 1,070 $ 894 Equipment 938 317 171 488 447 Total $ 2,160 $ 1,470 $ 1,299 $ 1,558 $ 1,341 Track Structure Statistics (Capital and Maintenance) 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Track miles of rail installed 484 422 434 459 401 Miles of track surfaced 5,441 5,326 5,568 5,209 5,014 New crossties installed (millions) 2.7 2.6 2.7 2.7 2.7 Average Age of Owned Railway Equipment 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 (years) Freight cars 30.3 31.0 30.3 29.9 30.1 Locomotives 21.0 20.5 19.9 18.9 18.1 Retired locomotives 31.7 28.4 31.2 34.4 30.0 For 2012, NS has budgeted $2.4 billion for property additions. The anticipated spending includes $840 million for roadway assets, including the normalized replacement of rail, ties and ballast and the improvement or replacement of bridges. Planned equipment spending of $588 million includes new and rebuilt locomotives, coal cars, intermodal containers and chassis, and multilevel automobile racks. Investments in facilities and terminals are anticipated to be $322 million, primarily for intermodal terminals and equipment to add capacity to the intermodal network, including the Crescent Corridor program, bulk transfer facilities and mechanical service shops. NS has budgeted $247 million for the continued implementation of positive train control (PTC) and expects additional PTC related property additions of at least $800 million in the years 2013 through 2015. NS also expects to spend $134 million on infrastructure improvements, which include investments for the Crescent and MidAmerica Corridors, CREATE project, and the Pan Am Southern venture. Technology investments of $92 million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers. K28 The Crescent Corridor consists of a program of projects for infrastructure and other facility improvements geared toward creating a seamless, high capacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from New Jersey to Louisiana and offering truck competitive service along several major interstate highway corridors, including I 81, I 85, I 20, I 40, I 59, I 78, and I 75. Based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief, NS plans to implement certain elements of the Crescent Corridor through a series of public private partnerships. Currently, the Crescent Corridor has received or expects to receive a total of $267 million in public capital funding commitments from the Commonwealths of Pennsylvania and Virginia, the state of Tennessee, the federal TIGER Stimulus Program and other federal funding sources related to projects in Alabama, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and North Carolina. NS currently estimates spending up to $360 million for the substantial completion of work on these projects, which is expected in 2014. Planned 2012 investments for the Crescent Corridor approximate $128 million. Cash used in financing activities was $2.0 billion in 2011, compared with $1.4 billion in 2010, and $31 million in 2009. The change in 2011 primarily reflects increased share repurchases, offset in part by higher proceeds from borrowing, net of debt repayments. The change in 2010 reflected the resumed repurchase and retirement of Common Stock as part of NS share repurchase program, in addition to lower borrowings, net of debt repayments. Share repurchases totaled $2.1 billion in 2011, $863 million in 2010, and zero in 2009 for the purchase and retirement of 30.2 million, 14.7 million, and zero shares, respectively. The timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by managements assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors. Any near term purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings. As of December 31, 2011, NS had remaining authority from its Board of Directors to repurchase 15.4 million shares throughDecember 31, 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2011, NS issued $500 million of 3.25% senior notes due 2021 and an additional$100 million of 6% senior notes due 2111. During the third quarter of 2011, NS issued $600 million of unsecured notes ($596 million at 4.837% due 2041 and $4 million at 6% due 2111) and paid $146 million of premium in exchange for $526 million of its previously issued unsecured notes ($422 million at 7.05% due 2037, $77 million at 7.9% due 2097, and $27 million at 7.25% due 2031). The premium is reflected as a reduction of debt in the 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash Flows and will be amortized as additional interest expense over the terms of the new debt. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the debt exchange. During the second quarter of 2011, NS issued an additional $400 million of 6% senior notes due 2111. NS debt to total capitalization ratio was 43.2% at December 31, 2011, compared with 39.7% at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, NS has authority from its Board of Directors to issue an additional $1 billion of debt or equity securities through public or private sale. NS has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Form S 3 automatic shelf registration statement for well known seasoned issuers under which securities may be issued pursuant to this authority. In December 2011, NS renewed and amended its five year credit agreement, which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants. The renewed and amended five year agreement, which expires in 2016, reduced the total amount that can be borrowed from $1 billion to $750 million to more closely match NS liquidity requirements. NS had no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2011, and NS is in compliance with all of its covenants. In October 2011, NS renewed its $350 million accounts receivable securitization program with a 364 day term to run until October 2012. There was $200 million outstanding under this program at December 31, 2011 and 2010 (see Note 8). Looking forward, NS annual debt maturities are relatively modest (see Note 8). Overall, NS goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support NS business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles. K29 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require management to make changes to these estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management regularly discusses the development, selection, and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions (see Note 11). These include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans assets, projected increases in medical costs, and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality. In addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value. Management makes these estimates based on the companys historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance). Management utilizes an independent actuarial consulting firms studies to assist it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities. NS net pension expense, which is included in Compensation and benefits in its Consolidated Statements of Income, was $50 million for 2011. In recording this amount, NS assumed a long term investment rate of return of 8.75%, which was supported by the long term total rate of return on plan assets since inception. A one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $16 million change in pension expense, and, as a result, an equal change in Compensation and benefits expense. Changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on NS net pension expense or net pension liability in the future. The net pension liability is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments. NS utilizes analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high quality corporate bonds. NS uses the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans. NS net cost for other postretirement benefits, which is also included in Compensation and benefits, was $101 million for 2011. In recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits, which is included in Other postretirement benefits, management estimated future increases in health care costs. These assumptions, along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them, are described in Note 11. Properties and Depreciation Most of NS total assets are long lived railway properties (see Note 6). As disclosed in Note 1, NS properties are depreciated using group depreciation. The primary depreciation method for NS asset base is group life. Units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources. Remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straight line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives. NS depreciation expense is based on managements assumptions concerning expected service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement. In developing these assumptions, NS management utilizes periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an independent outside firm of consulting engineers and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (STB), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. NS depreciation studies are conducted about every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets and other roadway property. The frequency of these studies correlates with guidelines established by the STB. K30 Key factors which are considered in developing average service life and salvage estimates include: statistical analyses of historical retirement data and surviving asset records; review of historical salvage received and current market rates; review of NS operations including expected changes in technology, customer demand, maintenance practices and asset management strategies; review of accounting policies and assumptions; and industry review and analysis. The units of production depreciation rate for rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross ton miles as compared to the total or ultimate capacity of rail in these corridors. NS experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in determination of the expected service life of rail in high density corridors. In developing the respective depreciation rate, consideration is also given to several rail characteristics including age, weight, condition (new or second hand) and type (curve or straight). As a result, a composite depreciation rate is developed which is applied to the depreciable base. NS recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties, these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense. Changes in rates as a result of depreciation studies are implemented prospectively. These studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property, as determined by the study. NS depreciation expense for 2011 amounted to $862 million. NS composite depreciation rates for 2011 are disclosed in Note 6; a one tenth percentage point increase (or decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a $32 million increase (or decrease) to depreciation expense. For 2011, roadway depreciation rates ranged from 0.83% to 33.3% and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 1.32% to 37.84%. When properties other than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized in earnings. Actual historical cost values are retired when available, such as with equipment assets. The use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the impracticality of tracking individual asset costs. When retiring rail, ties, and ballast, NS uses statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired. The historical cost of other roadway assets is estimated using a combination of inflation indices specific to the rail industry and those published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets. These indices are used because they closely correlate with the costs of roadway assets. Gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in Other income net (see Note 2) since such income is not a product of NS railroad operations. A retirement is considered abnormal if it does not occur in the normal course of business, if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies, which inherently consider the impact of normal retirements on expected service lives and depreciation rates. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements would be recognized in earnings, however, there were no such gains or losses in 2011, 2010, or 2009. NS reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flow. Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value. Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities NS expense for casualties and other claims, included in Materials and other, amounted to $216 million in 2011. Typically, most of this expense relates to NS accrual for personal injury liabilities. Job related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to railroads. FELAs fault based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no fault workers compensation system. The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded. In all cases, NS records a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable. K31 To aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period, NS utilizes studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm. For employee personal injury cases, the actuarial firm studies NS historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences. An estimate of the ultimate amount of the liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims, is based on the results of this analysis. For occupational injury claims, the actuarial firm studies NS history of claim filings, severity, payments and other relevant facts. Additionally, the estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting NS experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined. NS has recorded this actuarially determined liability. The liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic studies. Accordingly, there could be significant changes in the liability, which NS would recognize when such a change became known. While actuarial studies reflected a reduced level of favorable claims development between 2009 and 2010 (resulting in an increase of the annual cost related to personal injuries from $51 million to $75 million), a continued reduced level of favorable development in 2011 resulted in an increase in the annual cost related to personal injuries to $88 million in 2011 from $75 million in 2010. While the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study, it is possible that the ultimate liability could be higher or lower. NS is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations. It is NS policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably (see Note 16). Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS, are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy. Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $32 million in 2011, $26 million in 2010, and$20 million in 2009, and property additions for environmental matters totaled approximately $7 million in 2011, $8 million in 2010, and $11 million in 2009. Property additions for environmental matters in 2012 are expected to be about $9 million. NS Consolidated Balance Sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $35 million at December 31, 2011, and $33 million at December 31, 2010 (of which $12 million is classified as a current liability at the end of each period). At December 31, 2011, the liability represents NS estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 149 known locations and projects. As of that date, seven sites accounted for approximately $13 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period. At 26 locations, one or more NS subsidiaries in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes that impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs. NS calculates its estimated liability for these sites based on facts and legal defenses applicable to each site and not solely on the basis of the potential for joint liability. With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, unpredictable contaminant recovery and reduction rates associated with available clean up technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss (and that participants ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability. NS estimates its environmental remediation liability on a site by site basis, using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site. As a result, it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments. NS has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities. K32 Based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, management believes that it has recorded the probable and reasonably estimable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which NS is aware. Further, management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. Norfolk Southern and or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations. When management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to expenses. While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments, in managements opinion, any such recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims. However, the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter. Any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments are known. Income Taxes NS net long term deferred tax liability totaled $7.5 billion at December 31, 2011 (see Note 3). This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns. For state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized. NS had a $19 million valuation allowance on $957 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011, reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized. In addition, NS has a recorded liability for its estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. Management believes this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded. For every one half percent change in the 2011 effective tax rate, net income would have changed by $15 million. OTHER MATTERS Labor Agreements More than 80% of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (RLA). NS largely bargains nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the National Carriers Conference Committee (NCCC). Moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes. The NCCCs most recent round of bargaining began in November 2009. Although the current agreements with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) and the American Train Dispatchers Association (ATDA) extend through December 31, 2014, the health and welfare provisions from the national agreements will apply to the BLET and ATDA. Additionally, NS bargains separately with longshoremen, who are represented by the International Longshoremens Association (ILA), at Ashtabula (Ohio) Docks and do not participate in national bargaining. A new national agreement was reached with the United Transportation Union (UTU) on September 16, 2011, setting forth terms and working conditions through December 31, 2014. The UTU represents conductors, trainmen, hostlers, and yardmasters. K33 Generally, after a period of direct negotiations, either party may file for mediation if it believes insufficient progress is being made. The status quo is preserved during mediation while a federal mediator assists the parties in their efforts to reach an agreement and if unsuccessful, either party may seek self help (strike or lockout) after a 30 day cooling off period. Following failed mediation with two coalitions representing twelve unions, President Obama created Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) No. 243 in October 2011, which delayed any strike for 60 days while the PEB investigated the facts of the dispute and made recommendations. Since November 2011, the NCCC has reached tentative national mediated agreements with all twelve unions, largely adopting the recommendations of the PEB. Agreements with eleven of these unions have been ratified by their memberships. The tentative agreement with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division (BMWED) must still be ratified by its membership. Market Risks and Hedging Activities NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating rate debt instruments. At December 31, 2011, NS debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $200 million. A 1% point increase in interest rates would increase NS total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately $2 million. Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. This update, effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011, requires that the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This update does not change what items are reported in other comprehensive income or the requirement to report reclassification of items from other comprehensive income to net income. NS will adopt this ASU retrospectively in the first quarter of 2012 however, effective December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to Presentation Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 05, which deferred the requirement to present separate line items on the income statement for reclassification adjustments of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income. This deferral is temporary until the FASB reconsiders the operational concerns and needs of financial statement users. NS expects adoption of the ASU will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 04, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. The update, effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011, provides clarification about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements, and expands certain other disclosures requirements. NS will adopt this ASU in the first quarter of 2012 and expects adoption of the ASU will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. K34 Inflation In preparing financial statements, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. NS, a capital intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such property. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, unlikely, and project. Forward looking statements reflect managements good faith evaluation of information currently available. However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which management has little or no control, including: transportation of hazardous materials as a common carrier by rail; acts of terrorism or war; general economic conditions; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; the operations of carriers with which NS interchanges; disruptions to NS technology infrastructure, including computer systems; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; commercial, operating, environmental, and climate change legislative and regulatory developments; results of litigation; natural events such as severe weather, hurricanes, and floods; unavailability of qualified personnel due to unpredictability of demand for rail services; fluctuation in supplies and prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; and changes in securities and capital markets. For a discussion of significant risk factors applicable to NS, see Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors. Forward looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guarantee of future performance or results, nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved. As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. NS undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements. Item 7A.
