Legal Proceedings We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

As of April 26, 2002, there were 944 holders of record of the common stock. The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low closing sale prices for our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market.

See Item 1. Business Risk Factors. We have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock.
