Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Item 4. Submissions of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 28 Table of Contents PART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters Our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq National Market on November 21, 1995, and is traded under the symbol NTAP. As of April 30, 2004, there were 1,217 holders of record of the common stock. The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low closing sale prices for our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market. Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 High Low High Low First Quarter $ 19.56 $ 13.63 $ 18.04 $ 9.25 Second Quarter 26.13 14.88 10.64 5.63 Third Quarter 25.97 18.94 14.35 8.92 Fourth Quarter 23.63 18.61 14.88 9.40 We believe that a number of factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. See Item 1. Business Risk Factors. We have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently anticipate retaining all available funds, if any, to finance internal growth and product development as well as other management initiatives, including stock repurchases and acquisitions. Payment of dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings and financial condition and such other factors as the directors may consider or deem appropriate at the time. Information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is incorporated by reference from our Proxy Statement for the 2004 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. On February 18, 2004, we acquired Spinnaker Networks, Inc. (Spinnaker) for approximately $305.5 million (including transaction costs of $3.0 million) in an all stock transaction, through the merger of Nagano Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Network Appliance, with and into Spinnaker (the Merger), with Spinnaker to survive as the wholly owned subsidiary of Network Appliance. Under terms of the agreement, we acquired Spinnaker for 12.4 million shares of common stock and assumed options to purchase 2.9 million shares of common stock in connection with the Spinnaker 2000 Option Plan. We relied on an exemption under Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act in issuing the unregistered securities to the stockholders of Spinnaker. On March 1, 2004, we filed a Form S 8 registration statement with the SEC to register the assumed options of the Spinnaker 2000 Stock Plan. Repurchases of common stock On May 13, 2003, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a $150.0 million stock repurchase program to purchase shares of our outstanding common stock in the open market. During fiscal 2004, we repurchased 6.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $136.2 million. The repurchases were recorded as treasury stock and resulted in a reduction of stockholders equity. On May 18, 2004, we announced that the Board authorized an expansion of the program to purchase an additional $200.0 million of outstanding common stock. Total authorized stock purchase spending may be up to $350.0 million. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The duration of the repurchase program is open ended. Under the program, Network Appliance, Inc. may purchase shares of common stock through open market transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions under this program will depend on market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations. 29 Table of Contents The purchases will be funded from available working capital.
