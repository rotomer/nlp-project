Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Item 3. Legal Proceedings On September 5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems (Sun). On October 25, 2007, Sun filed a counter claim against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. On October 29, 2007, Sun filed another lawsuit against us in the Northern District of California asserting additional patents against us. The Texas court granted a joint motion to transfer the Texas lawsuit to the Northern 28 Table of Contents District of California on November 26, 2007. On March 26, 2008, Sun filed a third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent infringement charges to storage management technology we acquired in January 2008. We are unable at this time to determine the likely outcome of these various patent litigations. In addition, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of the potential settlement, no accrual has been recorded as of April 25, 2008. We received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General for the General Services Administration (GSA) seeking various records relating to GSA contracting activity by us during the period beginning in 1995 and ending in 2005. The subpoena is part of an investigation being conducted by GSA and the Department of Justice regarding potential violations of the False Claims Act in connection with our GSA contracting activity. The subpoena requested a range of documents including documents relating to our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of its GSA contracts. We are cooperating with the investigation and have produced documents and met with the Department of Justice on several occasions. Violations of the False Claims Act could result in the imposition of a damage remedy which includes treble damages plus civil penalties, and could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting, any or a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. However, as the investigation is still ongoing and we are unable at this time to determine the likely outcome of this matter, no provision has been recorded as of April 25, 2008. Item 4.
