Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Item 3. Legal Proceedings On September 5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems. On October 25, 2007, Sun Microsystems filed a counter claim against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. On October 29, 2007, Sun filed a second lawsuit against us in the Northern District of California asserting additional patents against us. The Texas court granted a joint motion to transfer the Texas lawsuit to the Northern District of California on November 26, 2007. On March 26, 2008, Sun filed a third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent infringement charges to storage management technology we acquired in January 2008. The three lawsuits are currently in the discovery phase and no trial date has been set, so we are unable at this time to determine the likely outcome of these various patent litigations. Since we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any potential settlement, no accrual has been recorded as of April 24, 2009. In April 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with the United States of America, acting through the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and on behalf of the General Services Administration (the GSA), under which we agreed to pay the United States $128.0 million, plus interest of $0.7 million, related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of GSA contracts between August 1997 and February 2005 in consideration for the release of NetApp by the DOJ and GSA with 32 Table of Contents respect to the claims alleged in the investigation as set forth in the settlement agreement. The agreement reflects neither an admission nor denial by us of any of the claims alleged by the DOJ and represents a compromise to avoid continued litigation and associated risks. We made the settlement payment on April 27, 2009. We are currently in discussions with the U.S. government to demonstrate that we have implemented processes and procedures to ensure that we comply with federal contracting rules. On June 12, 2009, a purported class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of Data Domain stockholders in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The complaint names as defendants the Data Domain directors, and NetApp and its merger subs. The lawsuit alleges breach of fiduciary duty by the Data Domain board and aiding and abetting that breach by NetApp. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and damages. We believe that the claims against it are without merit. Item 4. Submissions of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders At a special meeting of stockholders held on April 21, 2009, the stockholders of the Company approved (i) a one time option exchange program pursuant to which employees of the Company (excluding the Companys executive officers and directors) who hold certain options to purchase shares of the Companys common stock (such options, eligible options) are being given the opportunity to exchange such eligible options for restricted stock units and (ii) certain amendments to the Companys 1999 Stock Option Plan and other equity plans to facilitate the option exchange program. The table below shows the number of votes cast for and against such proposal and the number of votes withheld. Voted For Voted Against Abstained 129,568,703 127,715,080 75,235 The option exchange program commenced on May 22, 2009 and will expire on June 19, 2009, unless extended by the Company.

We currently anticipate retaining all available funds, if any, to finance internal growth and product development as well as other possible management initiatives, including stock repurchases and acquisitions. Payment of dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings and financial condition and such other factors as the directors may consider or deem appropriate at the time.
