Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Item 3. Legal Proceedings On October 13, 2010, Amalgamated Bank (as trustee of the Longview Largecap 500 Index Fund and the Longview Largecap 500 Index Veba Fund) filed a derivative lawsuit on behalf of NetApp, Inc. and NetApp U.S. Public Sector, Inc. in the Superior Court of the State of California, Santa Clara County. The lawsuit named 15 of our current and former directors as defendants. On February 3, 2011, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint in response to motions to dismiss that we and the individual defendants had filed. Like the original complaint, the amended complaint includes claims of breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets and alleges that the defendants failed to monitor internal controls to ensure that we complied with legal requirements in our General Services Administration (GSA) contracting activities, resulting in us incurring defense and settlement costs. The amended complaint seeks disgorgement of salaries and other compensation from the defendants and additional unspecified damages. We and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint in early March 2011, and the hearing on these motions is scheduled for July 15, 2011. Item 4.

We currently anticipate retaining all available funds, if any, to finance internal growth and product development as well as other possible management initiatives, including stock repurchases and acquisitions.

Net revenues and net income were higher by $129.2 million and $53.0 million, respectively, as a result of adoption of these new standards. Net revenues for fiscal 2009 included a GSA settlement of $128.7 million. (2) Based upon the closing price of our common stock for the prescribed measurement period in fiscal 2011, the contingent conversion threshold of the 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the Notes) was exceeded as of April 29, 2011. As a result, the Notes are convertible at the option of the holder through June 30, 2011. Accordingly, since the terms of the Notes require the principal to be settled in cash, we reclassified from stockholders equity to temporary equity the portion of the Notes attributable to the conversion feature which had not yet been accreted to its face value and the Notes have been classified as a current liability. For the holders to be able to continue to convert the Notes, our closing stock price must exceed $41.41 for 20 out of the last 30 trading days of each future calendar quarter. If this threshold is not met, the Notes will be reclassified to long term debt and the remaining portion of the Notes attributable to the conversion feature not yet accreted to its face value will be reclassified back to equity. 41 Table of Contents Item 7.
