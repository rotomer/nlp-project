Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Nucor is a domestic manufacturer of steel and steel products whose customers are located primarily in the United States. Additionally, Nucor is the nations largest recycler. Nucor reports its results in two segments, steel mills and steel products. Principal products from the steel mills segment are hot rolled steel (angles, rounds, flats, channels, sheet, wide flange beams, pilings, billets, blooms, beam blanks and plate) and cold rolled steel. Principal products from the steel products segment are steel joists and joist girders, steel deck, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems and light gauge steel framing. Hot rolled steel is manufactured principally from scrap, utilizing electric arc furnaces, continuous casting and automated rolling mills. Cold rolled steel, cold finished steel, steel joists and joist girders, and steel fasteners are manufactured by further processing of hot rolled steel. Steel deck is manufactured from cold rolled steel. In 2005, approximately 92% of the steel mills segment production was sold to non affiliated customers; the remainder was used internally by the steel products segment. During the last five years, Nucors sales have increased 167% from $4.76 billion in 2000 to $12.70 billion in 2005. Average sales price per ton has increased 46% from $425 in 2000 to $621 in 2005. Total tons sold to external customers have increased 83% from 11,189,000 tons in 2000 to 20,465,000 tons in 2005. This growth has been generated through acquisitions, optimizing existing operations and developing traditional greenfield projects using new technologies. Nucor achieved record sales and net earnings in 2005 due to historically high selling prices, margins and shipments, which were aided by our product line diversity. In addition to Nucors traditional strategy of growing by developing greenfield projects and continually improving existing operations, Nucors focus over the past several years has included growing profitably through acquisitions. In the steel mills segment, the capacity of our bar mills has more than doubled over the past five years, increasing from 3,000,000 tons in 2000 to 7,700,000 tons in 2005. This growth was driven by the acquisition of the assets of Auburn Steel in 2001, the assets of Birmingham Steels four bar mills in late 2002, and the assets of Marion Steel in 2005. These acquisitions were complemented by ongoing productivity gains obtained at existing bar mills. The capacity of our sheet mills has increased more than 80% from 5,900,000 tons in 2000 to 10,800,000 tons in 2005 due to the acquisition and start up in late 2002 of our sheet mill in Decatur, Alabama, as well as by continued productivity advances at our three other sheet mills. The sheet mills are well positioned to advance our strategic plan for greater participation in higher value added sheet markets. In 2000, Nucors plate mill in Hertford County, North Carolina, was in the early stages of start up and produced 20,000 tons. With the successful start up of the North Carolina facility and the acquisition of the assets of the Corus Tuscaloosa plate mill in 2004, Nucors plate capacity is now approximately 2,800,000 tons, allowing us to continue to benefit from the current robust plate market conditions. Nucor has also increased its participation in downstream steel products via acquisitions and joint ventures. With the acquisition of Fort Howard Steels operations in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in 2005, Nucor became the largest U.S. producer of cold finished bars. 6 Table of Contents Nucor established rebar fabrication joint ventures in 2004 and 2005, forming partnerships to grow in the reinforcing steel construction markets with two leaders in the rebar fabrication industry Harris Steel Group, Inc. and Ambassador Steel Corporation. In 2004, we formed a joint venture with Harris Steel Group to serve the western and northeastern U.S. rebar fabrication markets. This joint venture continues to grow and to generate strong returns. In 2005, we entered into a rebar fabrication joint venture with Ambassador Steel that will allow us to expand Nucors rebar fabrication presence into the central and southern regions of the country. This venture, Nufab Rebar, completed its first acquisition last May, purchasing a rebar fabricator serving Louisiana, Mississippi and the Florida panhandle region. Over the past five years, we have strengthened Nucors position as North Americas most diversified steel producer. RESTATEMENT As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, certain amounts have been restated to present variable rate demand notes (VRDNs) as short term investments instead of cash equivalents. We previously classified VRDNs as cash equivalents when the periods for interest rate resets were 90 days or less, based on our ability to either liquidate the VRDNs or roll them over to the next reset period. We reevaluated the presentation of these short term investments considering the original maturity dates associated with the underlying bonds. This restatement had no impact on Nucors net earnings, total current assets, changes in stockholders equity, or cash flows from operating activities and financing activities. Information presented for 2005 in the accompanying Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Managements Discussion and Analysis reflects such restatement. We did not invest in VRDNs prior to the third quarter of 2005. In May 2006, the board of directors approved a two for one stock split with a record date of May 19, 2006 and an effective date of May 31, 2006. All share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split. COMPARISON OF 2005 TO 2004 NET SALES Net sales for 2005 increased 12% to $12.70 billion, compared with $11.38 billion in 2004. The average sales price per ton increased 4% from $595 in 2004 to $621 in 2005, while total shipments to outside customers increased 7%. In the steel mills segment, net sales to external customers increased 9% from $10.11 billion in 2004 to $11.06 billion in 2005. Approximately 75% of the sales increase was due to higher sales volume resulting from stronger business conditions for bar, plate and structural products, as well as acquisitions made in 2004 and 2005. The remaining 25% of the increase in sales was due to higher average selling prices. Net sales to external customers in the steel products segment increased 29% from $1.27 billion in 2004 to $1.64 billion in 2005. Approximately 60% of the increase was due to higher average selling prices and approximately 40% of the increase was due to increased volume, reflecting a stronger non residential construction market. Nucor established new annual tonnage records in the steel mills segment for total steel shipments and steel shipments to outside customers in 2005. Total steel shipments, including those to the steel products segment, increased 6% to 20,669,000 tons in 2005, compared with 19,464,000 tons in the previous year. Steel sales to outside customers increased 7% to 19,020,000 tons in 2005, compared with 17,787,000 tons in 2004. In the steel products segment, production and shipment volumes increased over the prior year across all major product lines. Steel joist production for 2005 was 554,000 tons, compared with 522,000 tons in the previous year. Steel deck sales were a record 380,000 tons in 2005, compared with 364,000 tons in 2004. Cold finished steel sales were a record 342,000 tons in 2005, compared with 271,000 tons in the previous year aided by the successful integration of the Fort Howard Steel acquisition. 7 Table of Contents COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD The major component of cost of products sold is raw material costs. The average volume of raw materials used increased approximately 5% from 2004 to 2005, consisting of an increase of 4% in the steel mills segment and an increase of 14% in the steel products segment. The average price of raw materials increased approximately 5% from 2004 to 2005. The average price of raw materials in the steel mills segment and the steel products segment increased 3% and 25%, respectively, from 2004 to 2005. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used in our steel mills segment was $244 in 2005, an increase of 3% from $238 in 2004. By the fourth quarter of 2005, the average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used had decreased to $240 compared with the quarterly high of $278 in the fourth quarter of 2004. The average scrap cost per ton purchased decreased $40 (14%) from December 2004 to December 2005. Primarily as a result of the decreases in the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes during the year, Nucor incurred a credit to value inventories using the last in, first out (LIFO) method of accounting of $151.6 million in 2005, compared with a charge of $375.9 million in 2004 when scrap prices were increasing. Another significant component of cost of products sold for the steel mills segment is energy costs, since steel mills are large consumers of electricity and natural gas. Total energy costs increased approximately $7 per ton from 2004 to 2005 as natural gas prices increased approximately 31% and electricity prices increased approximately 19%. Due to the efficiency of Nucors steel mills, however, energy costs remained less than 10% of the sales dollar in 2005 and 2004. We expect that our total energy costs will remain high in 2006. Nucor is hedging a portion of its exposure to the variability of future cash flows for forecasted natural gas purchases over various time periods not exceeding two years. In 2005, the settlement of these hedging transactions reduced cost of products sold by approximately $12.4 million. In addition to these hedges, Nucor has entered into natural gas purchase contracts that commit Nucor to purchase $17.6 million, $22.7 million and $21.5 million of natural gas for production in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and $562.3 million between 2009 and 2028. These natural gas purchase contracts will primarily supply our direct reduced iron (DRI) facility in Trinidad. In December 2000, Nucor entered into a consent decree with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and certain states in order to resolve alleged environmental violations. Under the terms of this decree, Nucor is conducting testing at some of its facilities, performing corrective action where necessary and piloting certain pollution control technologies. Nucor revises estimates for environmental reserves as additional information becomes available and projects are completed. In 2005, Nucor made approximately $12.2 million in cash payments for remedial efforts and reduced reserves by approximately $9.4 million ($0.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively, in 2004). The most significant components of the decreases of reserves in 2005 are related to successful implementation of alternate environmental technologies that achieve full compliance with the agreement between Nucor and the USEPA through minor operational changes. The most significant components of the decreases in 2004 related to an agreement with the USEPA that certain technologies identified in the consent decree are not feasible and a favorable court ruling that implicated additional potentially responsible parties for the cleanup of an off site waste recycling facility. GROSS MARGIN Gross margins increased slightly from 20% in 2004 to 21% in 2005. In addition to the events and trends discussed above, gross margins are affected by pre operating and start up costs. Nucor defines pre operating and start up costs, all of which are expensed, as the losses attributable to facilities or major projects that are either under construction or in the early stages of operation. Once these 8 Table of Contents facilities or projects have attained a utilization rate that is consistent with our similar operating facilities, they are no longer considered by Nucor to be in start up. Pre operating and start up costs of new facilities decreased to $14.4 million in 2005, compared with $28.8 million in 2004. In 2005, these costs primarily related to the relocation of our DRI facility to Trinidad and its refurbishment and to our Hlsmelt project in Australia. In 2004, these costs primarily related to the continuing start up of the Castrip facility at our sheet mill in Crawfordsville, Indiana. Late in 2004, the Castrip process achieved commercial viability; therefore, the costs associated with this facility have not been included in start up costs in 2005. MARKETING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER EXPENSES The major components of marketing, administrative and other expenses are freight and profit sharing costs. Unit freight costs increased 12% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to higher fuel costs. Profit sharing costs, which are based upon and fluctuate with pre tax earnings, increased approximately 6% from 2004 to 2005. In 2005, profit sharing costs included $206.0 million for contributions to a Profit Sharing and Retirement Savings Plan for qualified employees, compared with $172.3 million in 2004. In both 2004 and 2005, all employees except for senior officers received a special cash bonus of $2,000 in addition to their regular profit sharing payments. These extraordinary bonuses were paid to employees for the achievement of record earnings during the year, resulting in additional profit sharing costs of approximately $22.6 million in 2005 and $21.0 million in 2004. Profit sharing costs also fluctuate based on Nucors achievement of certain financial performance goals, including comparisons of Nucors financial performance to peers in the steel industry and to other high performing companies. INTEREST EXPENSE Net interest expense is detailed below (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Interest expense $ 36,571 $ 29,335 Interest income (32,370 ) (6,983 ) Interest expense, net $ 4,201 $ 22,352 Gross interest expense increased approximately 25% primarily due to increased average interest rates, accompanied by an increase in average long term debt. Gross interest income increased more than fourfold due to increases in average short term investments and to a lesser extent due to increases in average interest rates. MINORITY INTERESTS Minority interests represent the income attributable to the minority partners of Nucors joint venture, Nucor Yamato Steel Company. Income attributable to minority interests increased from $80.9 million in 2004 to $110.7 million in 2005. Cash distributions to minority interests increased from $84.9 million in 2004 to $89.9 million in 2005. Under the partnership agreement, the minimum amount of cash to be distributed each year to the partners of Nucor Yamato Steel Company is the amount needed by each partner to pay applicable U.S. federal and state income taxes. In some years, such as 2004, the amount of cash distributed to minority interests exceeds amounts allocated to minority interests based on mutual agreement of the general partners; however, the cumulative amount of cash distributed to partners is less than the cumulative net earnings of the partnership. OTHER INCOME In 2005, Nucor received $9.2 million in settlement of claims against third parties related to environmental matters. Nucor has made claims for reimbursement of additional amounts. No amounts have been recorded for such reimbursements, if any, that may be received. In 2004, Nucor sold equipment resulting in pre tax gains of $1.6 million. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES Nucor had an effective tax rate of 35.02% in 2005 compared with 35.22% in 2004. In both 2005 and 2004, Nucor recorded refundable state income tax credits of $10.4 million. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining Nucors 2002 and 2003 federal income tax returns. Management believes that it has adequately provided for any adjustments that may arise from this audit. 9 Table of Contents NET EARNINGS AND RETURN ON EQUITY Net earnings and earnings per share for 2005 increased 17% and 18%, respectively, to a record $1.31 billion and $4.13 per diluted share, compared with $1.12 billion and $3.51 per diluted share in 2004. Net earnings as a percentage of net sales were 10.3% in 2005 compared with 9.9% in 2004. The 18% increase in earnings per share also reflects the effect of repurchasing approximately 11.1 million shares of outstanding common stock during 2005. Return on average stockholders equity was 33.9% and 38.7% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. COMPARISON OF 2004 TO 2003 NET SALES Net sales for 2004 increased 82% to $11.38 billion, compared with $6.27 billion in 2003. The average sales price per ton increased 66% from $359 in 2003 to $595 in 2004, while total shipments to outside customers increased 9%. In the steel mills segment, net sales to external customers increased 86% from $5.45 billion in 2003 to $10.11 billion in 2004. Approximately 85% of the increase was due to higher average selling prices resulting from increased demand for our products, which affected base prices, and the implementation of a raw materials surcharge to address historically high scrap costs. The remaining 15% of the sales increase was due to higher sales volume resulting from increased demand and the additional production capacity obtained from the acquisition of assets from Corus Tuscaloosa and Worthington in the second half of 2004 and the ramp up of production at Nucor Steel Decatur, LLC throughout the year. Net sales to external customers in the steel products segment were $819.7 million in 2003, compared with $1.27 billion in 2004, an increase of 55%. Approximately 75% of the increase was due to higher average selling prices, and approximately 25% of the increase was due to increased volume, reflecting an improved non residential construction market. Total steel shipments, including those to the steel products segment, increased 10% to 19,464,000 tons in 2004, compared with 17,656,000 tons in the previous year. Steel sales to outside customers increased 9% to 17,787,000 tons in 2004, compared with 16,263,000 tons in 2003. In the steel products segment, production and shipment volumes increased in 2004 over 2003 across all major product lines. Steel joist production for 2004 was 522,000 tons, compared with 503,000 tons in the previous year. Steel deck sales were 364,000 tons, compared with 353,000 tons in 2003. Cold finished steel sales were 271,000 tons in 2004, compared with 237,000 tons in the previous year. COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD The average volume of raw materials used increased 12% from 2003 to 2004, consisting of an increase of 12% in the steel mills segment and an increase of 14% in the steel products segment. The average price of raw materials increased 67% from 2003 to 2004. The average price of raw materials in the steel mills segment and the steel products segment increased 71% and 24%, respectively, from 2003 to 2004. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used in our steel mills segment was $238 in 2004, an increase of 74% from $137 in 2003. As a result of the increases in the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes, Nucor incurred a charge to value inventories using the LIFO method of accounting of $375.9 million in 2004, compared with a charge of $115.0 million in 2003. 10 Table of Contents Total energy costs per ton were flat from 2003 to 2004 as higher natural gas prices of approximately 8% were offset by increased production efficiency at our steel mills. These energy costs were less than 10% of the sales dollar in 2004 and 2003. Nucor made approximately $19.0 million in cash payments for environmental remedial efforts during 2003 and reduced reserves by approximately $8.3 million. In 2004, Nucor made approximately $0.4 million in cash payments for remedial efforts and reduced reserves by approximately $10.0 million. The most significant components of the decreases of reserves in 2003 and 2004 related to an agreement with the USEPA that certain technologies identified in the consent decree are not feasible and a favorable court ruling that implicated additional potentially responsible parties for the cleanup of an off site waste recycling facility. GROSS MARGIN Gross margins increased from 4% in 2003 to 20% in 2004. In addition to the events and trends discussed above, gross margins improved due to the turnaround achieved at our sheet mill in Decatur, Alabama, and the plate mill in Hertford County, North Carolina, and to the acquisitions we made in the third quarter of 2004. Pre operating and start up costs of new facilities decreased to $28.8 million in 2004, compared with $117.5 million in 2003. In 2004, these costs primarily related to the continuing start up of the Castrip facility at our sheet mill in Crawfordsville, Indiana. In 2003, these costs primarily related to the start up of the sheet mill in Decatur, Alabama, and the Castrip facility. MARKETING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER EXPENSES Unit freight costs increased 2% from 2003 to 2004. Profit sharing costs, which are based upon and fluctuate with pre tax earnings, increased fifteen fold from 2003 to 2004. In 2004, profit sharing costs included $172.3 million for contributions to a Profit Sharing and Retirement Savings Plan for qualified employees, compared with $8.9 million in 2003. Profit sharing costs in 2004 included an additional $21.0 million in extraordinary bonuses paid to employees for the achievement of record earnings during the year. All employees except for senior officers received two special cash bonuses of $1,000 each in July and November in addition to their regular profit sharing payments. INTEREST EXPENSE Net interest expense is detailed below (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Interest expense $ 29,335 $ 27,152 Interest income (6,983 ) (2,525 ) Interest expense, net $ 22,352 $ 24,627 Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to an increase in average short term investments, partially offset by an increase in average long term debt. MINORITY INTERESTS Income attributable to minority interests increased from $23.9 million in 2003 to $80.9 million in 2004. Cash distributions to minority interests increased from $63.3 million in 2003 to $84.9 million in 2004. OTHER INCOME In 2004 and 2003, Nucor sold equipment resulting in pre tax gains of $1.6 million and $4.4 million, respectively. In 2003, Nucor received $7.1 million, related to graphite electrodes anti trust settlements. Producers of graphite electrodes, which are used by Nucor to deliver energy in electric arc furnaces, have entered into several settlement agreements with their customers as the result of a price fixing investigation by the Department of Justice that became public in 1997. No settlements have been received since 2003, and we do not expect to receive any further graphite electrodes settlements. 11 Table of Contents PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES Nucor had an effective tax rate of 35.22% in 2004 compared with 6.12% in 2003. The higher tax rate in 2004 is primarily due to the effect of increased pre tax earnings, partially offset by the resolution of certain tax issues in the second half of 2004. In 2004 and 2003, Nucor recorded refundable state income tax credits of $10.4 million and $10.5 million, respectively. NET EARNINGS AND RETURN ON EQUITY Net earnings and earnings per share for 2004 increased approximately eighteen fold to $1.12 billion and $3.51 per diluted share, respectively, compared with $62.8 million and $0.20 per diluted share in 2003. Net earnings as a percentage of net sales were 9.9% in 2004 compared with 1.0% in 2003. Return on average equity was 38.7% and 2.7% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flows provided by operating activities provide us with a significant source of liquidity. When needed, we also have external short term financing sources available including the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under our bank credit facilities. We also issue long term debt from time to time. We have earned long term debt ratings of A by Standard and Poors and Al by Moodys Investors Services, the highest ratings of any metals and mining company in North America. We believe our strong financial position and our industry high credit rating provide us with flexibility and significant capacity to obtain additional capital on a cost effective basis. We anticipate that cash flows from operations and our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund expected normal operating costs, working capital, dividends and capital expenditures for our existing facilities. Any future significant acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources. During 2005, cash and cash equivalents increased 26% from $779.0 million to $980.2 million. In addition, short term investments as of December 31, 2005 totaled $857.4 million (none as of December 31, 2004). Short term investments consisted solely of variable rate demand notes (VRDNs), which are variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates but with stated maturities on the face of the bonds that exceed 90 days. All VRDNs in which Nucor invests are secured by direct pay letters of credit issued by high credit quality banks. This bank credit enhancement provides a high degree of security and liquidity to the VRDNs. Nucor is able to receive a cash payment in the amount of its principal invested and interest accrued on any VRDN no later than seven days after notifying the bank that it has elected to tender such bond. Working capital increased 34% from $2.11 billion at December 31, 2004 to $2.82 billion at December 31, 2005, and the current ratio increased from 3.0 to 3.2. Approximately $144.1 million and $71.1 million of the cash and cash equivalents position at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively, was held by our 51% owned joint venture, Nucor Yamato Steel Company. We have a simple capital structure with no off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated special purpose entities. Nucor uses derivative financial instruments from time to time primarily to manage the exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to manage exposure to changes in interest rates on outstanding debt instruments. December 31, 2005 As Restated (Note 2) (in thousands) 2004 Cash and cash equivalents $ 980,150 $ 779,049 Short term investments 857,360 Cash and cash equivalents held by Nucor Yamato 144,079 71,081 Working capital 2,815,854 2,109,158 Current ratio 3.2 3.0 OPERATING ACTIVITIES Nucor generated cash provided by operating activities of a record $2.14 billion in 2005 compared with $1.02 billion in 2004, an increase of 108%. This increase was the result of the 17% increase in net earnings and the increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities (exclusive of acquisitions) that provided cash of $357.6 million in 2005 compared with using cash of $580.8 million in 12 Table of Contents 2004. Accounts receivable increased $19.4 million in 2005 versus an increase of $354.9 million in 2004. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 were significantly higher than in the fourth quarter of the previous year, resulting in more accounts receivable at year end. In 2004, inventories increased to a record high level due to increased quantities and increased purchase costs. Inventories decreased in 2005 due to reduced inventory levels accompanied by purchase costs declining from the record highs experienced in the fourth quarter of 2004. INVESTING ACTIVITIES Our business is capital intensive; therefore, a significant portion of cash used in investing activities represents capital expenditures for new facilities, the expansion and upgrading of existing facilities and the acquisition of the assets of other companies. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.4 billion in 2005 compared with $534.9 million in 2004. Nucor invested $331.5 million in new facilities (exclusive of acquisitions) and expansion or upgrading of existing facilities in 2005 compared with $285.9 million in 2004. Also in 2005, Nucor had net purchases of short term investments totaling $857.4 million. These short term investments consisted solely of VRDNs, which are secured by direct pay letters of credit from high credit quality financial institutions, have a high degree of security and are very liquid. Existing cash and short term investments funded the acquisitions of the assets of Fort Howard Steel and Marion Steel in 2005 and of Corus Tuscaloosa and Worthington in 2004. Nucor expects to continue to pursue profitable growth through acquisitions. FINANCING ACTIVITIES Cash used in financing activities increased to $550.7 million in 2005 compared with $61.1 million in 2004. In 2005, Nucor increased its base dividend and paid a quarterly supplemental dividend, resulting in dividend payments tripling from $69.7 million in 2004 to $209.8 million in 2005. In 2004, Nucor issued $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of variable rate industrial revenue bonds due 2020. During 2005, the board of directors reactivated the previously approved stock repurchase program, and Nucor repurchased approximately 11.1 million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $291.2 million. In December 2005, the board approved the repurchase of up to an additional 20.0 million shares. A total of approximately 25.8 million shares remains authorized for repurchase. There were no repurchases during 2004. The percentage of long term debt to total capital (long term debt plus minority interests plus stockholders equity) was 17% and 20% at year end 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2005, Nucor entered into a new five year unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in June 2010 that provides for up to $700.0 million in revolving loans. Up to the equivalent of $600.0 million of the new credit facility will be available for foreign currency loans, and up to $450.0 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. The new credit facility may be increased by up to $300.0 million at the election of the Company in accordance with the terms set forth in the credit agreement. No borrowings were 13 Table of Contents outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2005. In connection with the new credit facility, in 2005 Nucor terminated (a) a $125.0 million 364 day revolver maturing in September 2005, and (b) a $300.0 million multi currency revolver maturing October 2007. At the date of termination, there were no borrowings under either terminated credit facility. MARKET RISK All of Nucors industrial revenue bonds have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually. These industrial revenue bonds represent 43% of Nucors long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2005. The remaining 57% of Nucors long term debt is at fixed rates. Future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. From time to time, Nucor makes use of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2005, there were no such contracts outstanding. Nucors investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. As a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities. Nucor also uses derivative financial instruments from time to time primarily to manage its exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process. Nucor, generally, does not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than hedging the cash flows associated with specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and consumed in future periods and hedging the exposures related to changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed rate debt instruments. Nucor recognizes all derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Nucor has ventures in Brazil and Australia that are in the early stages of operations and owns the DRI facility in Trinidad that is currently under construction. Accordingly, Nucor is exposed to the effects of currency fluctuations in those countries. Nucor presently does not hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2005 for the periods presented (in thousands). Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 andthereafter Long term debt $ 923,550 $ 1,250 $ $ 180,400 $ 741,900 Estimated interest on long term debt(1) 514,778 42,048 84,051 62,776 325,903 Operating leases 13,402 3,041 1,976 660 7,725 Raw material purchase commitments(2) 2,724,388 769,146 561,575 603,921 789,746 Utility purchase commitments(2) 928,999 170,972 148,710 73,625 535,692 Other unconditional purchase obligations(3) 142,842 140,601 2,241 Other long term obligations(4) 118,233 7,247 6,309 1,947 102,730 Total contractual obligations $ 5,366,192 $ 1,134,305 $ 804,862 $ 923,329 $ 2,503,696 (1) Interest is estimated using applicable rates at December 31, 2005 for Nucors outstanding fixed and variable rate debt. (2) Nucor enters into contracts for the purchase of scrap and scrap substitutes, iron ore, electricity, natural gas and other raw materials and related services, a significant portion of which pertain to our DRI facility in Trinidad. These contracts include multi year commitments and minimum annual purchase requirements and are valued at prices in effect on December 31, 2005 or according to the contract terms. These contracts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such commitments will adversely affect our liquidity position. (3) Purchase obligations include commitments for capital expenditures on operating machinery and equipment. (4) Other long term obligations include amounts associated with Nucors early retiree medical benefits and management compensation. DIVIDENDS Nucor has increased its cash dividend every year since it began paying dividends in 1973. In 2005, in addition to raising the base dividend, the board of directors implemented a supplemental dividend based on Nucors strong performance in 2004. 14 Table of Contents Nucor paid dividends of $0.67 per share in 2005 compared with $0.22 per share in 2004. In February 2006, the board of directors announced an increase in the base dividend to $0.10 per share and in the supplemental dividend to $0.25 per share, resulting in an annualized dividend rate of $1.40 per share. The supplemental dividend of $0.25 per share represents a portion of a total supplemental dividend estimated to be $1.00 per share to be paid over the next four quarterly dividend payments. The payment of any future supplemental dividends will depend upon many factors, including Nucors earnings, cash flows and financial position. OUTLOOK Our objective is to maintain a strong balance sheet while pursuing profitable growth. We expect to obtain additional capacity through expansions at our existing steel mills, greenfield construction utilizing advantageous new technologies and future acquisitions. Capital expenditures are currently projected to be approximately $400.0 million in 2006, an increase of 21% over 2005. This expected increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to the cost of construction and refurbishment of the DRI plant that we have relocated to Trinidad. Funds provided from operations, existing credit facilities and new borrowings are expected to be adequate to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements for existing operations. Nucor believes that it has the financial ability to borrow significant additional funds and still maintain reasonable leverage in order to finance major acquisitions. In the steel mills segment, total steel production is anticipated to increase over the next several years from the record 20,332,000 tons produced in 2005. Our current estimated annual capacity is approximately 25,000,000 tons, and additional capacity may be obtained through upgrading existing facilities as well as through acquisitions. We expect that demand in non residential construction will continue to strengthen throughout 2006 and that Nucor will continue to benefit from product line diversification. Although scrap prices remain at high levels, higher average selling prices, achieved through increased demand and the raw material surcharge, will continue to provide appropriate margins for our products. This surcharge will continue to ensure that we will be able to purchase the scrap needed to fill our customers needs. Nucor continues to build market leadership positions in attractive downstream steel products businesses. We anticipate that the continued improvement in non residential building will increase sales and the volume supplied by Vulcraft and Nucor Building Systems in 2006. Cold Finish sales will increase as additional capacity from our recent acquisition expands our presence in the midwest market and as our product line expands to include larger sizes and more leaded bars. We recognize that uncertainty in external factors such as raw materials costs, growth rate of the economy, the level of imports and consolidation in the industry will have a significant impact on our results. In 2006, we will continue working towards our goal of controlling approximately 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 tons of our supply of high quality scrap substitutes. Our raw materials strategy is driven by Nucors ongoing expansion of our steel product portfolio into higher quality grades. We will continue our defense of fair trade and will continue to point out examples of unfair trade policies and practices until they are fixed. We will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that expand our platform for generating earnings and attractive returns on our stockholders capital. While we cannot control these outside forces, Nucor will continue to be at the forefront of anticipating and addressing the issues that this uncertainty in external factors raises for us and other steel producers. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the valuation allowances for receivables; the carrying value of property, plant and equipment; reserves for environmental obligations; and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Accordingly, actual costs could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. REVENUE RECOGNITION We recognize revenue when products are shipped, which represents when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. 15 Table of Contents ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of most inventories is measured on the LIFO method of accounting. The LIFO method allocates the most recent costs to cost of products sold, thereby recognizing into operating results fluctuations in raw material, energy and other capitalizable costs more quickly than other methods. The cost of other inventories is determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) method. ASSET IMPAIRMENTS We evaluate the impairment of our property, plant and equipment on an individual asset basis or by logical groupings of assets. Asset impairments are recognized whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of those productive assets exceed their projected undiscounted cash flows. When it is determined that an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to estimated fair market value. ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION We are subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal, state and local authorities, and we make provision for the estimated costs related to compliance. Undiscounted remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures. The accruals are reviewed periodically and, as investigations and remediation proceed, adjustments are made as we believe are necessary. The accruals are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties. Our measurement of environmental liabilities is based on currently available facts, present laws and regulations, and current technology. INCOME TAXES We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We estimate our actual current tax expense and assess temporary differences that exist due to differing treatments of items for tax and financial statement purposes. These differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the change is enacted. We assess the realizability of deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis by considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If it is more likely than not, in our judgment, that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we provide a valuation allowance. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. As required by SFAS No. 123(R), Nucor will begin recognizing compensation costs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all of the equity based compensation plans in the first quarter of 2006. Compensation cost will be determined using the modified prospective method. Management believes the effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on our earnings will be comparable to the pro forma disclosures included in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on Nucors consolidated financial position. The FASB has issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, which clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. We are required to adopt the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of 2006. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 151 to have a material impact on Nucors consolidated financial position and results of operations. 16 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements made in this annual report are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward looking statements reflect the Companys best judgment based on current information, and although we base these statements on circumstances that we believe to be reasonable when made, there can be no assurance that future events will not affect the accuracy of such forward looking information. As such, the forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may vary materially from the results and expectations discussed in this report. Factors that might cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements include, but are not limited to: (1) the sensitivity of the results of our operations to volatility in steel prices and changes in the supply and cost of raw materials, including scrap steel; (2) availability and cost of electricity and natural gas; (3) market demand for steel products; (4) competitive pressure on sales and pricing, including pressure from imports and substitute materials; (5) uncertainties surrounding the global economy, including excess world capacity for steel production and fluctuations in international conversion rates; (6) U.S. and foreign trade policy affecting steel imports or exports; (7) significant changes in government regulations affecting environmental compliance; (8) the cyclical nature of the steel industry; (9) capital investments and their impact on our performance; and (10) our safety performance.
