ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 6. Selected Financial Data, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. Overview Our Company NVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in programmable graphics processor technologies. Our products are designed to enhance the end user experience on consumer and professional computing devices. We have four major product line operating segments: the graphics processing units, or GPU Business, media and communications processors, or MCP Business, Handheld GPU Business, and Consumer Electronics Business. Our GPU Business is composed of products that support desktop personal computers, or PCs, notebook PCs, professional workstations and other GPU based products; our MCP Business is composed of NVIDIA nForce products that operate as a single chip or chipset that provide system functions, such as high speed storage and network communications, and perform these operations independently from the host central processing unit, or CPU; our Handheld GPU Business is composed of products that support handheld personal digital assistants, or PDAs, cellular phones and other handheld devices; and our Consumer Electronics Business is concentrated in products that support video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices and is composed of our contractual arrangements with Sony Computer Entertainment, or SCE, to jointly develop a custom GPU for SCEs PlayStation3, sales of our Xbox related products, revenue from our license agreement with Microsoft Corporation, or Microsoft, relating to the successor product to their initial Xbox gaming console, the Xbox360, and related devices. Original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, add in card manufacturers, system builders and consumer electronics companies worldwide utilize NVIDIA processors as a core component of their entertainment and business solutions. Our GPUs are designed to deliver superior performance and crisp visual quality for PC based applications such as manufacturing, science, e business, entertainment and education. Our MCPs perform highly demanding multimedia processing for secure broadband connectivity, communications and storage. Our handheld GPUs deliver an advanced visual experience by accelerating graphics and video applications while implementing design techniques that result in high performance and relatively low power consumption. We were incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Our headquarter facilities are in Santa Clara, California. Our Internet address is www.nvidia.com. Seasonality Our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market. Due to the seasonality in this market, we typically expect to see stronger revenue performance in the second half of the calendar year related to the back to school and holiday seasons. Fiscal 2007 Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges GPU Business The combination of our GeForce 6, GeForce 7 and GeForce 8 series of GPUs and our Scalable Link Interface, or SLI, technology has created a new class of gaming PCs and professional workstations. SLI technology takes advantage of the increased bandwidth of the peripheral component interconnect, or PCI, Express bus architecture to allow up to four NVIDIA based graphics cards to operate in a single PC or up to two NVIDIA based graphics cards to operate in a notebook PC or professional workstation. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we shipped eight new GeForce 7 series GPUs for desktop and notebook PCs, expanding the offering of products in the GeForce 7 GPU family. In March 2006, we shipped our first Quad SLI system for desktop PCs, enabling the use of four GPUs per system. We also shipped the GeForce Go 7800 GTX notebook GPU featuring SLI technology for notebook PCs. 31 During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, our NVIDIA GeForce Go notebook GPU product line achieved record revenue for the second consecutive quarter. In addition, our NVIDIA Quadro professional product line increased its revenue 27% from the second quarter of fiscal 2006. We transitioned from our NVIDIA GeForce 6600 to the NVIDIA GeForce 7600, which delivers almost a 100% performance increase at the same price point. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we continued to experience growth in sales of our GeForce 7 series products, primarily in the mainstream and performance segments. Our NVIDIA GeForce Go notebook GPU product line achieved record revenue for the third consecutive quarter, primarily through increased sales in the notebook standalone GPU segment. In June 2006, we shipped the GeForce 7950 GX2, which provides 2500x1600 resolution. This is the resolution of cinematic film, and brings the 16:9 panoramic experience of cinema to gaming. We also announced PureVideo High Definition, or HD technology, a combination of hardware acceleration from an NVIDIA GPU, high definition movie player integration and High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection, or HDCP, feature support, to enable manufacturers and consumers to build PCs that can play High Definition Digital Video Disc, or HD DVD or Blu ray movies. In August 2006, we introduced the NVIDIA Quadro Plex 1000, the worlds first dedicated Visual Computing System. The NVIDIA Quadro Plex 1000 offers scalability in a desktop or dense 3U rackmount configuration for professional applications such as those powering multiple streams of 4K high definition video, 3D styling and design, scientific and medical visualization, oil and gas exploration, or visual simulation and training. In November 2006, we introduced our GeForce 8 series GPUs, which is based on a unified shader architecture. Instead of separate vertex and pixel shading processors, the GeForce 8800 has 128 stream processors, operating at 1.35GHz, that can process either vertex or pixel shader programs. GeForce 8800 is also the worlds first DX10 GPU. DX10 is a new Application Programming Interface, or API, for Microsoft Windows Vista, or Vista, and includes many new features. We also announced Compute Unified Device Architecture, or CUDA, a new mode of operation on GPUs where the computational power of the GPU can be utilized for computation intensive applications. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we extended our leadership share position in the notebook GPU segment to 58% share, according to the Mercury Research Fourth Quarter 2006 PC Graphics Report. Notebook GPU revenue grew over 120% year over year. Additionally, the NVIDIA Quadro professional product line achieved record revenue with a 24% revenue increase from the fourth quarter fiscal 2006. MCP Business In February 2006, we completed our acquisition of ULi Electronics, Inc., or ULi, a core logic developer for the PC industry. This acquisition represents our ongoing investment in our platform solution strategy and has strengthened our sales, marketing, and customer engineering presence in Taiwan and China. In March 2006, we shipped our first integrated graphics processor, or IGP, core logic solution for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD, based notebook PCs the GeForce Go 6100 GPU and NVIDIA nForce Go 430 MCP. This core logic solution is the industrys first high definition IGP to provide hardware accelerated H.264 high definition video playback. In May 2006, we shipped our NVIDIA nForce 590 SLI, a high performance motherboard solution for x86 PC platforms, including those based on socket AM2 processors by AMD. The NVIDIA nForce 590 SLI can utilize the power of up to four NVIDIA GeForce GPUs for HD gaming. In June 2006, we introduced the NVIDIA nForce 590 SLI for Intel Core2 Duo and Core 2 Extreme CPUs. In November 2006, we introduced our new NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI MCPs, which deliver performance for Intel Corporation, or Intel, CPUs and are designed specifically for enthusiasts with features such as SLI, Dual Net Gigabit Ethernet, and MediaShield RAID. The introduction of our NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI MCPs extends our nForce products for Intel Corporation, or Intels, CPUs with a performance platform for Intels Core2 Duo and new Core 2 Quad CPUs. 32 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the NVIDIA nForce MCP product line achieved record revenue for its tenth consecutive quarter. NVIDIA nForce MCP revenue grew 16% sequentially from the third quarter fiscal 2007 and 89% year over year. Our MCP growth was driven in part by increased adoption of our NVIDIA nForce notebook solutions by large PC manufacturers. For fiscal 2008, our key growth objectives for our MCP Business are to deliver new motherboard products for the Intel CPU segment and maintain our leadership positions on AMD platforms. We believe that Intel based consumers will demand NVIDIA branded graphics and system performance. Handheld GPU Business In March 2006, NVIDIA and Intel announced a collaboration to bring a 3D gaming and multimedia platform to handheld devices. The collaboration combines the NVIDIA GoForce family of handheld GPUs with Intel processors to deliver a development platform to content developers. Our GoForce handheld GPUs ship in the Motorola 3G RAZR V3X, SLVR L6i, SLVR L7i, MOTORAZR Maxx, and Sony Ericsson Walkman phones. Our newest handheld GPU, the NVIDIA GoForce 5500 GPU, has been designed into Digital Video Broadcast Handheld, or DVB H, phones in North America, Europe, and Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Terrestrial, or ISDB T, in Japan. In March 2006, we acquired Hybrid Graphics Ltd., or Hybrid Graphics, a developer of embedded 2D and 3D graphics software for handheld devices. In June 2006, we launched our MobileMedia Platform for handheld devices running Windows Mobile 5.0. The MobileMedia Platform is a development kit, containing both software and hardware components, that enables handheld manufacturers to design and release digital media rich devices with Windows Mobile 5.0. In January 2007, we completed our acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc., or PortalPlayer. Until recently, our Handheld GPU strategy has been to focus on establishing ourselves in the market as the leader of multimedia technology by leveraging our expertise in graphics, video, and image processing. With the acquisition of PortalPlayers expertise in building low power application processors for personal media players, or PMPs, we are now focused on delivering Systems On A Chip, or SOCs, that combine our application processors and GPUs. We expect SOCs such as these to power next generation smart phone and PMP devices. Consumer Electronics Business We record license revenue from our initial agreement with SCE to jointly develop a custom GPU for SCEs PlayStation 3 computer entertainment system, as well as from certain additional agreements with them. In addition, we record royalty revenue from SCE based on per unit sales of the PlayStation 3, which was launched by SCE in November 2006. Gross Margin Improvement We continue to remain focused on improving our gross margin. Beginning in fiscal 2005, we implemented profit improvement initiatives across our company which were designed to improve business and operational processes. During fiscal 2007, our gross margin was 42.4%, which represents an increase of over 410 basis points from our gross margin of 38.3% for fiscal 2006. Our gross margin was 38.3% for fiscal 2006, which represents an increase of 610 basis points from our gross margin of 32.2% for fiscal 2005. We will continue to focus on improving our gross margin during fiscal 2008. 33 Restatement On November 29, 2006, we restated our previously issued financial statements for fiscal years 2004 through 2006, and for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, together with selected financial statement items for earlier years, to correct errors related to accounting for stock based compensation expense. In June 2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of NVIDIA, or the Audit Committee, began a review of our stock option practices based on the results of an internal review voluntarily undertaken by management. The Audit Committee, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, completed its review on November 13, 2006 when the Audit Committee reported its findings to our Board of Directors, or the Board. The review covered option grants to all employees, directors and consultants for all grant dates during the period from our initial public offering in January 1999 through June 2006. Based on the findings of the Audit Committee and our internal review, we identified a number of occasions on which we used an incorrect measurement date for financial accounting and reporting purposes. These errors resulted primarily from our use during our fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002, of certain date selection methods discussed below which resulted in employees receiving options with stated exercise prices lower than the market prices as measured based upon the actual grant dates. We ceased using such practices beginning in our fiscal year 2003. The Audit Committee found that, beginning in our fiscal year 2003, we improved our stock option grant processes and have generally granted and priced our employee stock options in an objective and consistent manner since that time. However, for one Company wide annual stock option grant we made in fiscal 2004, we did not finalize the number of options allocated to each employee as of the stated grant date in May 2003, which resulted in stock based compensation charges due to the change in the measurement date to the date the grants were finalized. The Audit Committees review did not identify any additional stock based compensation charges from measurement date issues subsequent to that fiscal 2004 grant. As a result of the measurement date errors identified from the Audit Committees review, through January 29, 2006, we recorded aggregate non cash stock based compensation charges of $127.4 million, net of related tax effects. The errors resulted in after tax charges of $1.4 million and $11.7 million for our fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, the cumulative effect of the related after tax charges for periods prior to our fiscal year ended January 30, 2005 was $114.2 million. These additional stock based compensation expense charges were non cash and had no impact on our reported revenue, cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities for each of the restated periods. These charges were based primarily on Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, or APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (intrinsic value based) charges and associated payroll taxes of $199.6 million on a pre tax basis, which were amortized over the vesting term of the stock options in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 28, or FIN 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans. We amortized a substantial portion of these charges to expense during our fiscal years 2000 to 2006. The types of errors we identified generally fell into the following categories: Improper Measurement Dates for Company Wide Annual or Retention Stock Option Grants. We determined that, in connection with certain annual or retention stock option grants that we made to employees during our fiscal years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, the final number of shares that an individual employee was entitled to receive was not determined and or the proper approval of the related stock option grant had not been given until after the stated grant date. Therefore, the measurement date for such options for accounting purposes was actually subsequent to the stated grant date, resulting in new measurement dates for the related options. Improper Measurement Dates for Stock Option Grants during Fiscal Years 2001 and 2002. In connection with stock option grants that we made to newly hired employees (and, to a much lesser degree, retention grants to existing employees) during fiscal years 2001 and 2002, our practice was to grant stock options with an exercise price based upon the lowest closing price of our common stock in the last few days of the month of hire or the last few days of any subsequent month in the quarter of hire. The selection of the grant date of the related option grants would be made at the end of the fiscal quarter and was based on achieving the lowest exercise price for the affected employees. As a result of these practices, the measurement date for such options for accounting purposes was actually subsequent to the stated grant date, resulting in new measurement dates for the related options. Improper Measurement Dates for Stock Option Grants during Fiscal Year 2000. In connection with certain stock option grants to newly hired employees (and, to a much lesser degree, retention grants to existing employees) during a portion of fiscal year 2000, our practice was to delay the selection of the related grant dates until the end of a two month period in the fiscal quarter during which the employees who received the grants began their employment with NVIDIA. As a result of this practice, the exercise price of the related option grants was not determined until subsequent to the stated grant date. We also determined that, during fiscal year 2000, we generally set the grant date and exercise price of employee option grants for new hires and promotions at the lowest price of the last few business days of the month of their hire or promotion (or of the following month in certain two month periods that were chosen for an indeterminate reason). As a result of these practices, the measurement date for such options for accounting purposes was actually subsequent to the stated grant date, resulting in new measurement dates for the related options. In addition, we also determined that the exercise price or the number of options to be granted had not been determined, or the proper approval had not been given, for various other miscellaneous option grants during fiscal year 2000 until after the stated grant date resulting in new measurement dates for accounting purposes for the related options. 34 Other Issues Identified. We also identified instances where stock option grants did not comply with applicable terms and conditions of the stock plans from which the grants were issued. For example, two grants were made to officers of NVIDIA by the chief executive officer under delegated authority; however, under the terms of the applicable plan, the option grant should have been made by our Board or the Compensation Committee. There were also instances where (1) option grants were made to a small group of employees who joined NVIDIA pursuant to a business combination, and to a few other employees in certain instances, with stated exercise prices below the fair market value of our common stock on the actual measurement date of the related grants; and (2) option grants were made to a few individuals who were contractors rather than employees, without recording the appropriate accounting charges. In addition, the Audit Committee did not find any evidence that these violations were committed for improper purposes. The following table reconciles share based compensation previously recorded, the impact of these errors, by type, to the total restated share based compensation for all periods impacted: Three Months Ended For the Fiscal Years Ended Total Compensation April 30, 2006 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Expense (In thousands) Restatement adjustments: Improper measurement dates for company wide annual or retention stock option grants $ 1,860 $ 5,719 $ 17,468 $ 31,387 $ 27,051 $ 21,390 $ 9,230 $ 1,177 $ 115,282 Improper measurement dates for stock option grants during fiscal years 2001 and 2002 115 233 2,039 6,239 32,082 23,079 6,454 70,241 Improper measurement dates for stock option grants during fiscal year 2000 (1,738 ) (3,163 ) (1,608 ) 1,398 2,612 5,781 4,230 726 8,238 Other issues identified (1,061 ) 644 518 1,345 40 2,750 699 39 4,974 Additional compensation expense (824 ) 3,433 18,417 40,369 61,785 53,000 20,613 1,942 198,735 Tax related effects 140 (2,023 ) (6,676 ) (14,580 ) (21,887 ) (18,477 ) (7,824 ) (723 ) (72,050 ) Impact of restatement adjustments on income (loss) before change in accounting principle (684 ) 1,410 11,741 25,789 39,898 34,523 12,789 1,219 126,685 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax (704 ) (704 ) Impact of restatement adjustments on net income (loss) $ (1,388 ) $ 1,410 $ 11,741 $ 25,789 $ 39,898 $ 34,523 $ 12,789 $ 1,219 $ 125,981 Reconciliation: Stock based compensation, as originally recorded $ 23,049 $ 1,096 $ 1,337 $ 672 $ (156 ) $ 6 $ 112 $ 662 $ 26,778 Restatement adjustments: Additional compensation expense (824 ) 3,433 18,417 40,369 61,785 53,000 20,613 1,942 198,735 Stock based compensation, as restated $ 22,225 $ 4,529 $ 19,754 $ 41,041 $ 61,629 $ 53,006 $ 20,725 $ 2,604 $ 225,513 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 35 Revenue Recognition Product Revenue We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. For most sales, we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. At the point of sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment. Our policy on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized. Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets. We account for rebates in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 01 9, or EITF 01 9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products) and, as such, we accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor. Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale, unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate. Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate. Our customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. We account for MDFs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance with EITF 01 9. MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders, OEMs, distributors and add in card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. If market conditions decline, we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered. We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. License and Development Revenue For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally recognize this license revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting over the period that services are performed. For all license and service arrangements accounted for under the percentage of completion method, we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project. We periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate. A provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. To date, we have not recorded any such losses. Costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts. If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized, the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours. Any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period. Accounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Management determines this allowance, which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. If the financial condition of our customers, the financial institutions providing letters of credit, or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future. Our current credit insurance agreement expires on December 31, 2007. 36 As of January 28, 2007, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $1.3 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was $534.4 million. Of the $534.4 million, $150.3 million was covered by credit insurance and $19.8 million was covered by letters of credit. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or write offs on certain sales transactions in the future. As a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 0.2% and 0.4% during fiscal years 2007 and 2006. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit. As of January 28, 2007, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 0.2% of our gross accounts receivable balance. If our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance had been recorded at the high end of the range, at 0.4% of our gross receivable balance, then our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at January 28, 2007, would have been approximately $2.4 million, rather than the actual balance of $1.3 million. Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis; which approximates actual cost on an average or first in, first out basis. We write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market, obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand, future product purchase commitments, estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products, additional future inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may have higher gross margins when products are sold. Sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on our gross margin. As of January 28, 2007, our inventory reserve was $39.7 million. As a percentage of our gross inventory balance, our inventory reserve has ranged between 8.9% and 15.9% during fiscal years 2007 and 2006. As of January 28, 2007, our inventory reserve represented 10.1% of our gross inventory balance. If our inventory reserve balance had been recorded at the high end of the range, at 15.9% of our gross inventory balance, then our inventory reserve balance at January 28, 2007, would have been approximately $62.8 million, rather than the actual balance of $39.7 million. Inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped. Income Taxes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. United States income tax has not been provided on earnings of our non U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. Our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements, accordingly. As of January 28, 2007, we had a valuation allowance of $68.6 million. Of the total valuation allowance, $3.7 million relates to state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to potential utilization limitations as a result of stock ownership changes, and $64.9 million relates to state deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes probable, recognition of these acquired tax benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero, then reduce other non current intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income tax expense. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to state tax benefits becomes probable, we would recognize an income tax benefit in the period such asset is more likely than not to be realized. 37 As of January 28, 2007, with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, we have derecognized both deferred tax assets for the excess of tax benefit related to stock based compensation, reflected in our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards, and the offsetting valuation allowance. Consistent with prior years, the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards, in the amount of $344.9 million as of January 28, 2007, will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity, if and when realized. In determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized, we have elected to do so on a with and without approach with respect to such excess tax benefits. We have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stock based compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes, and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from continuing operations. Goodwill Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments for the purposes of completing our Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, impairment test. We utilize a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment. The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value based test. In computing fair value of our reporting units, we use estimates of future revenues, costs and cash flows from such units. The second step, if necessary, measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities. We elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and concluded that there was no impairment. However, future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings in future periods due to the potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with such tests. Stock based Compensation Effective January 30, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the awards, and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period. Stock based compensation expense recognized during fiscal 2007 was $116.7 million, which consisted of stock based compensation expense related to stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. Please refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We elected to adopt the modified prospective application method beginning January 30, 2006 as provided by SFAS No. 123(R). We recognize stock based compensation expense using the straight line attribution method. We estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a lattice binomial model. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we recorded stock based compensation expense equal to the amount that would have been recognized if the fair value method was used, for the purpose of the pro forma financial information provided in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, or SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosures. At the beginning of fiscal 2006, we transitioned from a Black Scholes model to a binomial model for calculating the estimated fair value of new stock based compensation awards granted under our stock option plans. The determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, vesting schedules, death and disability probabilities, expected volatility and risk free interest. Our management determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and, therefore, could reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility. The risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts. We began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model. Using the lattice binomial model, the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans have been estimated using the following assumptions during the year ended January 28, 2007: Weighted average expected life of stock options (in years) 3.6 5.1 Risk free interest rate 4.7% 5.1 % Volatility 39% 51 % Dividend yield 38 For our employee stock purchase plan we continue to use the Black Scholes model. The fair value of the shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan has been estimated using the following assumptions during year ended January 28, 2007: Weighted average expected life of stock options (in years) 0.5 2.0 Risk free interest rate 1.6% 5.2 % Volatility 30% 47 % Dividend yield SFAS No. 123(R) also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of SFAS No. 123(R) in future periods, the compensation expense that we record under SFAS No. 123(R) may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation, fines and or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue. Year Ended January 28, 2007 January 29, 2006 January 30, 2005 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 57.6 61.7 67.8 Gross profit 42.4 38.3 32.2 Operating expenses: Research and development 18.0 15.0 17.3 Sales, general and administrative 9.6 8.5 10.2 Settlement costs 0.6 Total operating expenses 27.6 24.1 27.5 Income from operations 14.8 14.2 4.7 Interest and other income, net 1.3 0.8 0.6 Income before income tax expense 16.1 15.0 5.3 Income tax expense 1.5 2.3 0.9 Net income 14.6 % 12.7 % 4.4 % 39 Fiscal Years Ended January 28, 2007, January 29, 2006, and January 30, 2005. Revenue We report financial information for four product line operating segments to our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, as follows: the GPU Business, the MCP Business, the Handheld GPU Business, and the Consumer Electronics Business. Revenue in the "All Other" category is primarily derived from sales of memory devices. Please refer to Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Fiscal 2005 was a 53 week year, compared to fiscal years 2007 and 2006 which were 52 week years, and we believe that this extra week may have had a positive impact on our revenue in fiscal 2005. However, we are not able to quantify the effect of the slightly longer year on our fiscal 2005 revenue. Fiscal Year 2007 vs. Fiscal Year 2006 Revenue was $3.07 billion for fiscal 2007, compared to $2.38 billion for fiscal 2006, which represents an increase of 29.2%. A discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows: GPU Business. GPU Business revenue increased by 20.3% to $1.99 billion for fiscal 2007, compared to $1.66 billion for fiscal 2006. The increase was a result of increased sales of our desktop GPU products, notebook products and our NVIDIA professional workstation products. The increase in sales of our desktop GPU products was led by our GeForce 7 based and GeForce 8 based products that serve the high end segment. Sales of our NVIDIA notebook products improved due to an increased mix of GeForce 7 based products, shipping for notebook PC design wins based on Intels Napa platform. This increase in sales was slightly offset by a decrease in average selling prices. Our NVIDIA professional workstation product sales increased due to an increase in unit shipments, offset by a slight decrease in average selling prices. MCP Business. MCP Business revenue was $661.5 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $352.3 million for fiscal 2006, which represents an increase of 87.8%. The overall increase in MCP business revenue is primarily due to sales of newer NVIDIA nForce4 products, NVIDIA nForce5 products, integrated AMD based desktop products, and integrated Intel based desktop products, which began shipping after the second quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition, revenue also increased as a result of our acquisition of ULi in February 2006. Handheld GPU Business. Handheld GPU Business revenue was $108.5 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $58.7 million for fiscal 2006, which represents an increase of 84.7%. The overall increase in Handheld GPU Business revenue is due to an increase in unit sales of high end feature cellular phone and PDA products. Consumer Electronics Business. Consumer Electronics Business revenue was $96.3 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $167.4 million for fiscal 2006, which represents a decrease of 42.5%. This decrease is a result of discontinued sales of our Xbox related products to Microsoft, partially offset by revenue recognized from our contractual development arrangements. We recognized revenue from the sale of our Xbox related products to Microsoft for the last time during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we recognized $92.9 million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE for its PlayStation3, compared to $49.0 million of revenue recognized during fiscal 2006. For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we expect a seasonal decline associated with the PC business. Although we believe our market and competitive position in each of our business units continues to be strong, there are no significant industry growth drivers to offset seasonality. Microsofts next generation operating system, Microsoft Windows Vista, or Vista, has shipped. We believe that Vista is the first operating system to present, as a standard, the power of the GPU to all applications and that, in the future, a significant percentage of PCs will have Vista. With Vista, DX10, and HD/Blu ray DVD as the technologies for PCs for the coming year, we believe that 3D graphics will become a central part of the computing experience and that the GPU will be more important than ever. However, to date we have not seen a significant impact from the launch of Vista. Fiscal Year 2006 vs. Fiscal Year 2005 Revenue was $2.38 billion for fiscal 2006, compared to $2.01 billion for fiscal 2005, which represents an increase of 18.2%. A discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows: GPU Business. GPU Business revenue increased by 22.9% to $1.66 billion for fiscal 2006 compared to $1.35 billion for fiscal 2005. The increase was the result of increased sales of our GeForce 6 and GeForce 7 families of desktop GPUs that serve the high end GPU segment, offset by a slight decline in sales of our mainstream GPU products. In addition, sales of our NVIDIA Quadro professional workstation products and notebook products continued to improve due to an increased mix of GeForce 6 based and GeForce 7 based products, which resulted in an increase in average selling prices. 40 MCP Business. MCP Business revenue was $352.3 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $175.7 million for fiscal 2005, which represents an increase of 100.6%. The overall increase in MCP Business revenue is primarily due to increased sales of NVIDIA nForce4 products, which we began selling during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and an increase in average selling prices. The overall increase was offset by a decrease in sales of NVIDIA nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce2 products. Handheld GPU Business. Handheld GPU Business revenue was $58.7 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $45.9 million for fiscal 2005, which represents an increase of 27.9%. The overall increase in Handheld GPU Business revenue is due to an increase in average selling prices of high end feature phone products and revenue recognized as a result of a development contract. Consumer Electronics Business. Consumer Electronics Business revenue was $167.4 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $260.0 million for fiscal 2005, which represents a decrease of 35.6%. The decrease in our Consumer Electronics Business is a result of decreased and discontinued sales of our Xbox related products to Microsoft, partially offset by revenue recognized from our contractual arrangement with SCE. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Microsoft indicated that it would not order any more Xbox related products from us after our second fiscal quarter. As a result, we recognized revenue from the sale of our Xbox related products to Microsoft for the last time during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2006, we recognized $49.0 million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom GPU for SCEs PlayStation3. No such revenue was recognized during our fiscal 2005 as our definitive agreement with SCE was not executed until the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas accounted for 83.6%, 84.0% and 75.9% of total revenue for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, add in board and motherboard manufacturers revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. The increase in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to discontinued sales of XGPUs and MCPs used in the Microsoft Xbox product during fiscal 2006, which were billed to Microsoft in the United States. Sales to our significant customers accounted for approximately 12% of our total revenue from one customer during fiscal year 2007, 26% of our total revenue from two customers during fiscal year 2006, and 31% of our total revenue from two customers during fiscal year 2005. Gross Profit Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements. Gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue. Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold. Our gross margin was 42.4%, 38.3%, and 32.2% for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as follows: Fiscal Year 2007 vs. Fiscal Year 2006 GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU Business increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to the sale of our GeForce 8 series GPUs and increased sales of our GeForce 7 series GPUs, which collectively accounted for approximately 70% of our GPU Business revenue. Our GeForce 8 and our GeForce 7 series GPUs generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of GPUs. MCP Business. The gross margin of our MCP Business decreased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to a shift in product mix to higher volumes of integrated AMD based desktop products which have experienced lower gross margins than our discrete MCP products, and inventory reserves that we recorded as a charge to cost of revenue that primarily related to purchase commitments that we believed had exceeded future demand. 41 Handheld GPU Business. The gross margin of our Handheld GPU Business increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to an increase in unit sales of high end feature cellular phone and PDA products which generally have higher gross margins than our previous Handheld GPU products. Consumer Electronics Business. The gross margin of our Consumer Electronics Business increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to license and royalty revenue from our contractual development arrangements that have higher gross margins compared to the gross margin of Xbox products shipped in fiscal 2006. Fiscal Year 2006 vs. Fiscal Year 2005 GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the sale of our GeForce 7 series GPUs and increased sales of our GeForce 6 series GPUs, which collectively accounted for approximately 78% of our fiscal 2006 GPU Business revenue. Our GeForce 7 and our GeForce 6 series GPUs generally have higher gross margins than our GeForce FX series GPUs which comprised 53% of our fiscal 2005 GPU Business revenue. In addition, average selling prices from our notebook GeForce 7 and GeForce 6 series GPU products increased as a larger percentage of our total notebook revenue during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. MCP Business. The gross margin of our MCP Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the increase in revenue from sales of our NVIDIA nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce4 products, which to date have experienced higher gross margins than previous generations of NVIDIA nForce products. Handheld GPU Business. The gross margin of our Handheld GPU Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the inventory write off of certain handheld products in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Consumer Electronics Business. The gross margin of our Consumer Electronics Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the reduction of die costs for Xbox related products, and the recognition of revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom GPU for SCEs PlayStation3. Consolidated Gross Margin The improvement in our gross margin reflects our continuing focus on delivering cost effective product architectures, enhancing business processes and delivering profitable growth. We expect gross margin to remain flat or improve slightly during the first quarter of fiscal 2008.

In process research and development expense, or IPR&D, increased by $14.0 million as a result of our acquisitions of PortalPlayer and Hybrid Graphics during fiscal 2007. Depreciation and amortization increased $1.6 million due to emulation hardware and software programs that were purchased during fiscal 2006, resulting in a full year of depreciation in fiscal 2007 compared to a partial year of depreciation in fiscal 2006. Computer software and equipment increased $11.2 million primarily due to increased allocation of information technology expenses and facilities increased $6.4 million due to increased facilities expense allocation, both of which were based on the growth in headcount. New product development increased by $7.1 million as a result of costs related to an overall increase in the number of product tape outs and in prototype materials. License and development project costs decreased by $10.5 million primarily due to the inversed impact of decreased development costs related to our collaboration with SCE and other engineering costs related to a different development contract. Certain of our personnel who usually devote their time to research and development efforts have spent time working on these development projects. The cost associated with the time these individuals spend working on development projects is allocated from research and development to cost of revenue or is capitalized on our balance sheet. During fiscal 2007, less time was spent working on development projects so less cost was allocated to cost of revenue or capitalized and, therefore, more cost remained in research and development. Other expenses increased $6.2 million primarily due to travel and other employee related expenses associated with the expansion of our international sites including our acquisitions of ULi and Hybrid Graphics. Research and development expenses increased by $8.9 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to a $32.5 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 423 additional personnel and a $5.3 million increase in computer software and equipment primarily due to increased allocation of information technology expenses. Depreciation and amortization increased $2.1 million due to increased purchases of hardware and software equipment and facilities increased $0.6 million due to increased facilities expense allocation, both of which were based on the growth in headcount. Other expenses increased $3.9 million primarily due to travel and other employee related expenses associated with the expansion of our international sites. These increases were offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense of $8.2 million and an increase of $26.9 million in license and development project costs, primarily related to increased development costs related to our collaboration with SCE and other engineering costs related to a different development contract. Certain of our personnel who usually devote their time to research and development efforts have spent time working on these development projects. The cost associated with the time these individuals spend working on development projects is allocated from research and development to cost of revenue or is capitalized on our balance sheet. During fiscal 2006, more time was spent working on development projects so more cost was allocated to cost of revenue or capitalized and, therefore, less cost remained in research and development. We anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue. Sales, General and Administrative Year Ended Year Ended Jan. 28, 2007 Jan. 29, 2006 $ Change % Change Jan. 29, 2006 Jan. 30, 2005 $ Change % Change (In millions) (In millions) Sales, General and Administrative: Salaries and benefits $ 139.0 $ 108.3 $ 30.7 28 % $ 108.3 $ 94.4 $ 13.9 15 % Advertising and promotions 63.5 49.4 14.1 29 % 49.4 66.6 (17.2 ) (26 )% Stock based compensation (1) 38.5 (2.2 ) 40.7 1,850 % (2.2 ) 3.7 (5.9 ) (159 )% Legal and accounting fees 25.9 18.7 7.2 39 % 18.7 12.6 6.1 48 % Facility expense 14.0 12.5 1.5 12 % 12.5 9.6 2.9 30 % Depreciation and amortization 8.6 8.5 0.1 1 % 8.5 13.0 (4.5 ) (35 )% Other 4.0 6.9 (2.9 ) (42 )% 6.9 4.3 2.6 60 % Total $ 293.5 $ 202.1 $ 91.4 45 % $ 202.1 $ 204.2 $ (2.1 ) (1 )% Sales, general and administrative as a percentage of net revenue 10 % 9 % 9 % 10 % (1) Stock based compensation includes charges/credits relating to payroll taxes accrued for as part of the restatement. 43 Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $91.4 million, or 45%, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a $40.7 million increase in stock based compensation resulting from our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and a $30.7 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 201 additional personnel. Legal and accounting fees increased by $7.2 million primarily due to our internal review of historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of prior year financial results. Advertising and promotions increased by $14.1 million due to travel and other employee costs associated with our international expansion. These increases were offset by a decrease of $2.9 million in other expenses related to reimbursement from collection settlements. Sales, general and administrative expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to a a $17.2 million decrease in advertising and promotion costs, primarily associated with a reduction in certain marketing programs, tradeshow expenses, new product launches and customer samples, other marketing costs, travel related and employee recruitment expenses. In addition, stock based compensation expense decreased by $5.9 million and depreciation and amortization decreased by $4.5 million. These decreases were offset by a $13.9 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 122 additional personnel and a $6.1 million increase in legal expenses primarily due to certain insurance reimbursements that we received during fiscal 2005 that reduced this expense, and increased litigation activity during fiscal 2006 related to 3dfx Interactive, Inc., or 3dfx, and American Video Graphics, LP, or AVG. In addition there were increases of $2.9 million in facility expense due primarily to the expansion of our international sites and $2.6 million in other general and administrative expenses, offset by a reduction in bad debt expense. Operating Expenses We anticipate that our operating expenses will be relatively flat in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We believe that even with the additional expense from our acquisition of PortalPlayer, we may be able to keep operating expenses flat as we focus on expense controls and restrict headcount additions in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. In process research and development In connection with our acquisition of Hybrid Graphics in March 2006 and PortalPlayer in January 2007, we wrote off $0.6 million and $13.4 million, respectively, of IPR&D, that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. In accordance with SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, as clarified by FIN 4, Applicability of SFAS No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method an interpretation of SFAS No. 2, amounts assigned to IPR&D meeting the above stated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price. Settlement Costs Settlement costs were $14.2 million for fiscal 2006. The settlement costs are associated with two litigation matters, 3dfx and AVG. AVG is settled. For further information about the 3dfx matter, please refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income increased from $20.7 million to $41.8 million from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the result of higher average balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates in fiscal 2007 when compared to fiscal 2006. Interest income increased from $11.4 million to $20.7 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the result of higher average balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005. Other Income (Expense), net Other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities. There were no significant changes in other income from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. However, other income decreased by $1.1 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the liquidation of marketable securities during fiscal 2006 in order to obtain the cash needed for the repatriation of certain foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $46.4 million, $55.6 million and $18.4 million during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 9.4% in fiscal 2007, 15.6% in fiscal 2006, and 17.2% in fiscal 2005. The difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily a result of changes in our geographic mix of income subject to tax, with the additional change in mix in fiscal 2007 due to certain stock based compensation expensed for financial accounting purposes under SFAS No. 123(R) and an increase in the research tax credit benefit in fiscal 2007. Please refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the components of our income tax expense. 44 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of January 28, 2007 As of January 29, 2006 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 544.4 $ 551.8 Marketable securities 573.4 398.4 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 1,117.8 $ 950.2 Year Ended January 28, January 29, January 30, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 587.1 $ 446.4 $ 132.2 Net cash used in investing activities (540.8 ) (41.8 ) (152.0 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (53.6 ) (61.4 ) 13.8 As of January 28, 2007, we had $1.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $167.6 million from the end of fiscal 2006. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top tier investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration. Operating activities generated cash of $587.1 million, $446.4 million, and $132.2 million during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The annual cash provided by operating activities in amounts greater than net income is due primarily to non cash charges to earnings and the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options. Non cash charges to earnings included stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization on our long term assets. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in fiscal 2007, non cash charges to earnings included $116.7 million of stock based compensation expense and related deferred income tax impact. The increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily related to the $212.6 million increase in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities. On our consolidated balance sheet, accrued liabilities increased $77.2 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the recording of income taxes payable for fiscal 2006, the increase in accruals related to customer programs and the recording of $30.6 million in relation to 3dfx, of which $25.0 million was recorded as an adjustment to goodwill. Accounts payable decreased $58.8 million and inventories decreased $60.9 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of significant reductions in older products, offset by an increase in new products. Accounts receivable increased $21.9 million primarily due to increased sales and improved linearity of sales, and cash collections during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases and sales of marketable securities, acquisition of businesses and purchases of property and equipment, which include leasehold improvements for our facilities, and intangible assets. Investing activities used cash of $540.8 million, $41.8 million and $152.0 million during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to $401.8 million of cash used for our acquisitions of PortalPlayer, ULi and Hybrid Graphics during the fiscal year. Additionally, net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of $145.3 million attributable to purchases of new research and development equipment, hardware equipment, technology licenses, software, intangible assets and leasehold improvements at our various facilities. These uses of cash were offset by $6.2 million of net proceeds from sales of marketable securities. Net cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2006 was primarily due to $79.6 million for capital expenditures primarily attributable to purchases of new research and development equipment, hardware equipment, technology licenses, software, intangible assets and leasehold improvements at our headquarters facility in Santa Clara, California and at our international sites. In addition, we used cash of $12.1 million for our acquisition of a private company and $9.7 million for the investments we made during fiscal 2006 in non affiliated companies. These uses of cash were offset by $59.6 million of net proceeds from sales of marketable securities. Net cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2005 was primarily due to $84.7 million of net purchases of marketable securities. In addition, we used $67.3 million for capital expenditures primarily attributable to purchases of leasehold improvements for our new data center at our headquarters campus, new research and development emulation equipment, technology licenses, software and intangible assets. We expect to spend approximately $120 million to $140 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2008, primarily for purchases of software licenses, emulation equipment, computers and engineering workstations. In addition, we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets. 45 Financing activities used cash of $53.6 million, $61.4 million and provided cash of $13.8 million during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. Net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to $275.0 million paid towards our stock repurchase program, offset by cash proceeds of $221.2 million from common stock issued under employee stock plans. Cash used in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from $188.5 million related to our stock repurchase program, offset by $127.5 million of common stock issued under employee stock plans. Stock Repurchase Program On August 9, 2004 we announced that our Board had authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to certain specifications, up to an aggregate maximum amount of $300 million. Subsequently, on March 6, 2006, we announced that our Board had approved a $400 million increase to the original stock repurchase program. As a result of this increase, the amount of common stock the Board has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased to a total of $700 million. The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock repurchase programs, in compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, Rule 10b 18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our share repurchase program, we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock, within a pre determined range, at the end of the term of the agreement. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 10.3 million shares of our common stock for $275.0 million under structured share repurchase transactions, which we recorded on the trade date of the transaction. Through the end of fiscal 2007, we have repurchased 27.3 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of $488.1 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we entered into a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase shares of our common stock for $125.0 million that we expect to settle prior to the end of our first fiscal quarter. Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then current stockholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and, as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include: decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and or our customers products; inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next generation products; competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors. For additional factors see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Operations Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. 3dfx Asset Purchase On December 15, 2000, NVIDIA Corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an agreement, which closed on April 18, 2001, to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70.0 million, less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2000. The Asset Purchase Agreement also provided, subject to the other provisions thereof, that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for, then we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of NVIDIA common stock. If 3dfx could not make such a certification, but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than $25.0 million, then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock, with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by $25.00 per share. If 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for, or could not be satisfied, for less than $25.0 million, we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets. 46 In October 2002, 3dfx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. In March 2003, we were served with a complaint filed by the Trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy Court which sought, among other things, payments from us as additional purchase price related to our purchase of certain assets of 3dfx. In early November 2005, after many months of mediation, NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, or the Creditors Committee, reached a conditional settlement of the Trustees claims against NVIDIA. This conditional settlement, presented as the centerpiece of a proposed Plan of Liquidation in the bankruptcy case, was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the Bankruptcy Court after notice and hearing. The Trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement, which would have called for a payment by NVIDIA of approximately $30.6 million to the 3dfx estate. Under the settlement, $5.6 million related to various administrative expenses and Trustee fees, and $25.0 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx. Accordingly, during the three month period ended October 30, 2005, we recorded $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx. However, the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process. On December 21, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court determined that it would schedule trial of one portion of the Trustees case against NVIDIA. On January 2, 2007, NVIDIA exercised its right to terminate the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the Creditors Committees plan. Beginning on March 21, 2007, NVIDIA and the Trustee are scheduled to try the question of the value of the assets 3dfx conveyed to NVIDIA and, in particular, whether the price NVIDIA paid for those assets was reasonably equivalent to the value of the assets 3dfx sold to NVIDIA.

Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations that are not on our balance sheet as of January 28, 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Contractual Obligations Total Within 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years (In thousands) Operating leases $ 167,765 $ 33,890 $ 65,432 $ 61,998 $ 6,445 Purchase obligations (1) 364,486 364,486 Capital purchase obligations 4,829 4,829 Total contractual obligations $ 537,080 $ 403,205 $ 65,432 $ 61,998 $ 6,445 (1) Represents our inventory purchase commitments as of January 28, 2007. During the fiscal year 2007, we entered into a confidential patent licensing arrangement. Our commitment for future license payments under this arrangement could range from $97.0 million to $110.0 million over a ten year period; however, the net outlay under this arrangement may be reduced by the occurrence of certain events covered by the arrangement. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 28, 2007, we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S K 303(a)(4)(ii). Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Interpretation No. 48, or FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to FASB Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under FIN 48 a company would recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits, and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within the financial statements. Any differences between tax liability amounts recognized in the statements of operations as a result of adoption of FIN 48 would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The provisions of FIN 48 will be effective as of first quarter of fiscal 2008. We believe that the cumulative effect of adoption of FIN 48 will not result in any material change to the beginning balance of our retained earnings. 47 In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, or SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The changes to current practice resulting from the application of this Statement relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 157 beginning with our fiscal quarter ending April 29, 2007. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, or SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. We adopted the provisions of SAB No. 108 in our fiscal year 2007. The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, or SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 159 beginning with our fiscal quarter ending April 27, 2008, although earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We invest in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments in commercial paper, money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies. These investments are denominated in United States dollars. We account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. All of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under SFAS No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity, net of tax. As of January 28, 2007, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both +/ 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately $3.0 million. Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Currently, sales and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. To date, we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future. 48
