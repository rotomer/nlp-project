ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 6. Selected Financial Data, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. Overview Our Company NVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphics processing unit, or the GPU. Our products are designed to generate realistic, interactive graphics on consumer and professional computing devices. We serve the entertainment and consumer market with our GeForce products, the professional design and visualization market with our Quadro products, and the high performance computing market with our NVIDIA Tesla products. We have four major product line operating segments: the GPU business, the professional solutions business, or PSB, the media and communications processor, or MCP, business, and the consumer products business, or CPB. Our GPU business is comprised primarily of our GeForce products that support desktop and notebook personal computers, or PCs, plus memory products. Our PSB is comprised of our NVIDIA Quadro professional workstation products and other professional graphics products, including our NVIDIA Tesla high performance computing products. Our MCP business is comprised of NVIDIA nForce core logic and motherboard GPU products. Our CPB is comprised of our GoForce and APX mobile brands and products that support handheld personal media players, or PMPs, personal digital assistants, or PDAs, cellular phones and other handheld devices. CPB also includes license, royalty, other revenue and associated costs related to video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices. Original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, add in card manufacturers, system builders and consumer electronics companies worldwide utilize NVIDIA processors as a core component of their entertainment, business and professional solutions. We were incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Our headquarter facilities are in Santa Clara, California. Our Internet address is www.nvidia.com. The contents of our website are not a part of this Form 10 K. Seasonality Our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market. Due to the seasonality in this market, we typically expect to see stronger revenue performance in the second half of the calendar year related to the back to school and holiday seasons. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges GPU Business During fiscal year 2008, our GeForce product was the share leader in the Standalone Desktop GPU and Standalone Notebook GPU categories for calendar year 2007 as reported in the 2007 Fourth Quarter PC Graphics Report from Mercury Research. Additionally, we maintained our leadership position in both the DirectX9 and DirectX10 generation of standalone desktop GPUs. During fiscal year 2008, we launched several new GPUs, adding the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra, 8800 GT, 8600, 8500, and 8300 to our GeForce 8 series of GPUs, which previously included the 8800 GTX and 8800 GTS. The success of these products helped us grow our share in the Standalone Desktop GPU category from 52% in the fourth quarter of calendar 2006 to 64% in the fourth quarter of calendar 2007, according to the Mercury Research 2006 and 2007 Fourth Quarter PC Graphics Reports, respectively. During fiscal year 2008, we also launched our PureVideo HD technology, which is a video decode and post processing technology for Blu ray and HD DVD. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, we launched a new family of GeForce 8M Series notebook GPUs. We also supported the production ramp of top notebook PC OEMs, including Acer, Apple, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba. We experienced a high degree of design win success for the Intel Santa Rosa platform cycle during fiscal year 2008, which helped our standalone notebook category share grow from 58% in the fourth quarter of calendar 2006 to 75% in the fourth quarter of calendar 2007, according to the Mercury Research 2006 and 2007 Fourth Quarter PC Graphics Reports. 40 Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2008, on February 11, 2008, we completed our acquisition of Aegia Technologies, Inc., or Aegia, an industry leader in gaming physics technology. Ageias PhysX software is widely adopted in several PhysX based games that are shipping or in development on Sony Playstation 3, Microsoft XBOX 360, Nintendo Wii, and gaming PCs. We believe that the combination of the GPU and physics engine brands will result in an enhanced visual experience of the gaming world. Professional Solutions Business During fiscal year 2008, we launched seven new Quadro solutions, including the Quadro FX 370 and 570. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we expanded our NVIDIA Quadro Plex family with the introduction of the NVIDIA Quadro Plex VCS IV, a new version of the NVIDIA Quadro Plex visual computing system, or VCS, which provides enhanced performance for a wide range of high performance, graphics intensive styling and design, oil and gas, and scientific applications. Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we launched the NVIDIA Quadro FX 4600 and NVIDIA Quadro FX 5600 products, which are professional solutions based on our GeForce 8 series unified architecture. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, we also introduced a new line of notebook workstation GPUs, the NVIDIA Quadro FX 1600M, 570M and 360M. In fiscal year 2008, we also introduced NVIDIA Tesla, our entry into the high performance computing industry. Tesla is a new family of GPU computing products that delivers processing capabilities for high performance computing applications. The Tesla family consists of the C870 GPU computing processor, the D870 Deskside Supercomputer and the S870 1U Computing Server. In fiscal year 2008, we completed our acquisition of Mental Images, an industry leader in photorealistic rendering technology. Mental Images Mental Ray product is considered by many to be the most pervasive ray tracing renderer in the industry. Mental Images visualization technology is embedded in most major digital content creation, or DCC, and computer aided design, or CAD, applications, and its rendering technology is deployed by major manufacturers and film studios. We believe that this strategic combination will enable the development of tools and technologies that will advance the state of visualization, will be optimized for next generation computing architectures, and will create new product categories for both hardware and software. MCP Business In fiscal year 2008, we announced a new technology named Hybrid SLI. We named it hybrid because this technology combines a powerful as well as an energy efficient engine, and of Scalable Link Interface, or SLI, because it is our multi GPU technology. The technology is application aware so, depending on the processing demands of each application running on the host PC, the discrete GPU may be completely shut down in order to save power. During fiscal year 2008, our NVIDIA nForce products held the leadership position for the AMD segment, as reported in the 2007 Fourth Quarter PC Processor and Chipsets Report from Mercury Research. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, we shipped our first single chip motherboard GPUs, or mGPUs, for Intel processor based desktop PCs. The GeForce 7000 mGPU family delivers the performance of an entry level discrete GPU when compared against traditional integrated graphics solutions. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we shipped the GeForce 7050 mGPU, which targets the lower cost categories of the market. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we extended the reach of SLI technology into the performance category with the launch of our NVIDIA nForce 650i SLI, 680i LT SLI and 680i Ultra MCP products for Intel. Consumer Products Business During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we unveiled our first applications processor the GoForce 6100. The GoForce 6100 is designed for next generation PMPs, and multimedia smart phones. We began to ship the GoForce 6100 during the second quarter of fiscal year 2008. Subsequent to fiscal year 2008, in February 2008, we launched the NVIDIA APX 2500. The APX 2500 is a computer on a chip designed to meet the growing multimedia demands of todays mobile phone user. The APX 2500 is the culmination of several hundred man years of research and development. We believe that the mobile application processor is an area where we can add a significant amount of value and we also believe it represents a revenue growth opportunity. 41 Gross Margin Improvement We continued to focus on improving our gross margin in fiscal year 2008. Our gross margin was 45.6% for fiscal year 2008, an increase of 320 basis points from our gross margin of 42.4% for fiscal year 2007. Our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products that we earn revenue from during each of our fiscal periods. Product mix is often difficult to estimate with accuracy. Therefore, if we achieve significant revenue growth in our lower margin product lines, or if we are unable to earn as much revenue as we expect from higher margin product lines, our gross margin may be negatively impacted. We expect gross margin will be relatively flat to slightly up during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. Subsequent Event Property Purchase On February 14, 2008, we closed escrow on a purchase of property that includes approximately 25 acres of land and ten commercial buildings in Santa Clara, California for approximately $150.0 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, or Board. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Revenue Recognition Product Revenue We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For most sales, we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms. At the point of sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment. Our policy on sales to certain distributors, with rights of return, is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized. Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets. We account for rebates in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 01 9, or EITF 01 09, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products) and, as such, we accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor. Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale, unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate. Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate. 42 Our customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. We account for MDFs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance with EITF 01 09. MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, distributors and add in card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. Depending on market conditions, we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered. We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. License and Development Revenue For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally recognize this license revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting over the period that services are performed. For all license and service arrangements accounted for under the percentage of completion method, we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project. We periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate. A provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts. If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized, the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours. Any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period. Accounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Management determines this allowance, which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. If the financial condition of our customers, the financial institutions providing letters of credit, or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future. Our current credit insurance agreement expires on December 31, 2009. As of January 27, 2008, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $1.0 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was $686.2 million. Of the $686.2 million, $180.7 million was covered by credit insurance and $17.1 million was covered by letters of credit. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or write offs on certain sales transactions in the future. As a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 0.1% and 0.3% during fiscal years 2008 and 2007. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit. As of January 27, 2008, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 0.1% of our gross accounts receivable balance. If our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance had been recorded at the high end of the range, at 0.3% of our gross receivable balance, then our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at January 27, 2008, would have been approximately $1.9 million, rather than the actual balance of $1.0 million. Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis; which approximates actual cost on an average or first in, first out basis. We write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market, obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand, future product purchase commitments, estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products, additional future inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may have higher gross margins when products are sold. Sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on our gross margin. As of January 27, 2008, our inventory reserve was $32.9 million. As a percentage of our gross inventory balance, our inventory reserve has ranged between 8.4% and 13.5% during fiscal years 2008 and 2007. As of January 27, 2008, our inventory reserve represented 8.4% of our gross inventory balance. If our inventory reserve balance had been recorded at the high end of the range, at 13.5% of our gross inventory balance, then our inventory reserve balance at January 27, 2008, would have been approximately $52.7 million, rather than the actual balance of $32.9 million. Inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped. 43 Income Taxes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. United States income tax has not been provided on earnings of our non U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. Our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements, accordingly. As of January 27, 2008, we had a valuation allowance of $82.5 million. Of the total valuation allowance, $4.7 million relates to state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to potential utilization limitations as a result of stock ownership changes, and $77.8 million relates to state deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes more likely than not, recognition of these acquired tax benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero, then reduce other non current intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income tax expense. We would recognize an income tax benefit during the period that the realization of the deferred tax assets related to state tax benefits becomes more likely than not In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stock based compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of $564.1 million as of January 27, 2008. Consistent with prior years, the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity, if and when realized. In determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized, we have elected to do so on a with and without approach with respect to such excess tax benefits. We have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stock based compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes, and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from continuing operations. On January 29, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, or FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, issued in July 2006. FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to SFAS No. 109. Under FIN 48 we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. The cumulative effect of adoption of FIN 48 did not result in a material adjustment to our tax liability for unrecognized income tax benefits. Our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense did not change as a result of implementing the FIN 48. Please refer to Note 13 of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 44 Goodwill Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments for the purposes of completing our Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, impairment test. We utilize a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment. The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value based test. In computing fair value of our reporting units, we use estimates of future revenues, costs and cash flows from such units. The second step, if necessary, measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities. We elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and concluded that there was no impairment. Determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. In addition, we make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. The long term financial forecast represents the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable. However, actual performance in the near term and longer term could be materially different from these forecasts, which could impact future estimates of fair value of our reporting units and may result in a charge to earnings in future periods due to the potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with such tests. Stock based Compensation Effective January 30, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the awards, and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period. Stock based compensation expense recognized during fiscal years 2008 and 2007 was $133.4 million and $116.7 million, respectively, which consisted of stock based compensation expense related to stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. Please refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We elected to adopt the modified prospective application method beginning January 30, 2006 as provided by SFAS No. 123(R). We recognize stock based compensation expense using the straight line attribution method. We estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we recorded stock based compensation expense equal to the amount that would have been recognized if the fair value method was used, for the purpose of the pro forma financial information provided in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, or SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosures. At the beginning of fiscal year 2006, we transitioned from a Black Scholes model to a binomial model for calculating the estimated fair value of new stock based compensation awards granted under our stock option plans. The determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, vesting schedules, death and disability probabilities, expected volatility and risk free interest. Our management determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and, therefore, could reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility. The risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts. We began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model. 45 Using the binomial model, the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans have been estimated using the following assumptions during the year ended January 27, 2008: Weighted average expected life of stock options (in years) 3.8 5.8 Risk free interest rate 3.3% 5.0 % Volatility 37% 54 % Dividend yield For our employee stock purchase plan we continue to use the Black Scholes model. The fair value of the shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan has been estimated using the following assumptions during year ended January 27, 2008: Weighted average expected life of stock options (in years) 0.5 2.0 Risk free interest rate 3.5% 5.2 % Volatility 38% 54 % Dividend yield SFAS No. 123(R) also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of SFAS No. 123(R) in future periods, the compensation expense that we record under SFAS No. 123(R) may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters for which we are responsible. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation, fines and or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. 46 Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue. Year Ended January 27, 2008 January 28, 2007 January 29, 2006 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 54.4 57.6 61.7 Gross profit 45.6 42.4 38.3 Operating expenses: Research and development 16.9 18.0 15.0 Sales, general and administrative 8.3 9.6 8.5 Settlement costs 0.6 Total operating expenses 25.2 27.6 24.1 Income from operations 20.4 14.8 14.2 Interest and other income, net 1.6 1.3 0.8 Income before income tax expense 22.0 16.1 15.0 Income tax expense 2.5 1.5 2.3 Net income 19.5 % 14.6 % 12.7 % Fiscal Years Ended January 27, 2008, January 28, 2007 and January 29, 2006 Revenue We report financial information for four major product line operating segments to our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, as follows: the GPU Business, PSB, MCP business, and CPB. Revenue in the "All Other" category is primarily derived from sales of components. Please refer to Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Fiscal Year 2008 vs. Fiscal Year 2007 Revenue was $4.10 billion for fiscal year 2008, compared to $3.07 billion for fiscal year 2007, which represents an increase of 34%. For the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we expect a slight seasonal decline associated with the PC business, although overall, we believe our market and competitive position continues to be strong. A discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows: GPU Business. GPU Business revenue increased by 47% to $2.52 billion in fiscal year 2008, compared to $1.71 billion in fiscal year 2007. This improvement was primarily due to increased sales of our desktop GPU products and notebook GPU products. Sales of our desktop GPU products increased by approximately 38% compared to fiscal year 2007, primarily due to growth of the Standalone Desktop market as reported in the 2007 Fourth Quarter PC Graphics Report from Mercury Research. Our leadership position in the Standalone Desktop market was driven by our GeForce 8 based products. Sales of our notebook GPU products increased by approximately 114% compared to fiscal year 2007. Notebook GPU revenue growth was primarily due to share gains in the Standalone Notebook category as reported in the 2007 Fourth Quarter PC Graphics Report from Mercury Research. Our share gains in the Standalone Notebook category were primarily a result of shipments of products used in notebook PC design wins related to Intels Santa Rosa platform used in notebooks. PSB. PSB revenue increased by 29% to $588.4 million in fiscal year 2008, compared to $454.7 million in fiscal year 2007. Our professional workstation product sales increased due to an overall increase in shipments of boards and chips. This increase in shipments was primarily driven by our transition from previous generations of NVIDIA Quadro professional workstation products to GeForce 8 based products. MCP Business. MCP Business revenue increased by 7% to $710.4 million in fiscal year 2008, compared to $661.5 million in fiscal year 2007. The increase resulted from an approximate 225% increase in sales of our Intel based platform products as compared to fiscal year 2007. We began ramping up shipments of our Intel based platform products after the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. This increase was offset by a decline in sales of our AMD based platform products and sales of products related to our acquisition of ULi Electronics, Inc. in February 2006. CPB. CPB revenue increased by 8% to $251.1 million in fiscal year 2008, compared to $233.2 million in fiscal year 2007. The overall increase in CPB revenue is primarily due to increased royalties from Sony Computer Entertainment, or SCE, but was offset by decreases in revenue from our cell phone products and our contractual development arrangements with SCE. 47 Fiscal Year 2007 vs. Fiscal Year 2006 Revenue was $3.07 billion for fiscal year 2007, compared to $2.38 billion for fiscal year 2006, which represents an increase of 29%. A discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows: GPU Business. GPU Business revenue increased by 21% to $1.71 billion for fiscal year 2007, compared to $1.41 billion for fiscal year 2006. The increase was a result of increased sales of our desktop and notebook products. The increase in sales of our desktop products was led by our GeForce 7 based and GeForce 8 based products that serve the high end segment. Sales of our notebook products improved due to an increased mix of GeForce 7 based products, shipping for notebook PC design wins based on Intels Napa platform. This increase in sales was slightly offset by a decrease in average selling prices. PSB. PSB revenue increased by 21% to $454.7 million in fiscal year 2007, compared to $376.2 million in fiscal year 2006. Our professional workstation product sales increased due to an increase in unit shipments, offset by a slight decrease in average selling prices. MCP Business. MCP Business revenue was $661.5 million for fiscal year 2007, compared to $352.3 million for fiscal year 2006, which represents an increase of 88%. The overall increase in MCP business revenue is primarily due to sales of newer NVIDIA nForce4 products, NVIDIA nForce5 products, integrated AMD based desktop products, and integrated Intel based desktop products, which began shipping after the second quarter of fiscal year 2007. In addition, revenue also increased as a result of our acquisition of ULi in February 2006. CPB. CPB revenue increased by 1% to $233.2 million in fiscal year 2007, compared to $230.1 million in fiscal year 2006. The overall increase in CPB revenue is primarily due to increased unit sales of high end feature cellular phone and PDA products as well as revenue recognized from our contractual development arrangements. The increase in CPB revenue was offset by a decrease in sales of our Xbox related products to Microsoft. We recognized revenue from the sale of our Xbox related products to Microsoft for the last time during the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. Concentration of Revenue We generated 89%, 86% and 84% of our total revenue for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, from sales to customers outside the United States and other Americas. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, add in board and motherboard manufacturers revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. Sales to our significant customers accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenue from one customer during fiscal year 2008, 12% of our total revenue from one customer during fiscal year 2007, and 26% of our total revenue from two customers during fiscal year 2006. 48 Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements. Gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue. Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold. Our gross margin was 45.6%, 42.4% and 38.3% for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The improvement in our gross margin reflects our continuing focus on delivering cost effective product architectures, enhancing business processes and delivering profitable growth. Our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell. Product mix is often difficult to estimate with accuracy and, thus, if we achieve significant revenue growth in our lower margin product lines, or if we are unable to earn as much revenue as we expect from higher margin product lines, our gross margin may be negatively impacted. We expect gross margin to remain relatively flat to slightly up during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as follows: Fiscal Year 2008 vs. Fiscal Year 2007 GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU Business increased during fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007. This increase was primarily due to increased sales of our GeForce 8 series GPUs, which began selling in the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. Our GeForce 8 series GPUs generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of GPUs. Additionally, the more favorable costs of memory purchases during fiscal year 2008, positively impacted our gross margin. PSB. The gross margin of our PSB increased during fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007. This increase was primarily due to increased sales of our GeForce 8 based NVIDIA Quadro products, which began selling in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of NVIDIA Quadro products. MCP Business. The gross margin of our MCP Business increased during fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007. This increase was primarily due to a shift in product mix towards Intel based platform products, which began to ramp up shipments after the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, and inventory reserves that we recorded as a charge to cost of revenue during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 of approximately $4.1 million related to certain NVIDIA nForce purchase commitments that we believed had exceeded future demand. CPB. The gross margin of our CPB decreased during fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007. This decrease was primarily due to a drop in gross profit realized from sales of our high end feature cellular phone and other handheld devices. However, increased royalties from SCE during fiscal year 2008, offset the decreases. Fiscal Year 2007 vs. Fiscal Year 2006 GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU Business increased during fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006, primarily due to the sale of our GeForce 8 series GPUs and increased sales of our GeForce 7 series GPUs, which collectively accounted for approximately 70% of our GPU Business revenue. Our GeForce 8 and our GeForce 7 series GPUs generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of GPUs. PSB. The gross margin of our PSB increased during fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006. This increase was primarily due to increased sales of our GeForce 7 based NVIDIA Quadro products, which began to ramp up in sales during fiscal year 2007 and generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of NVIDIA Quadro products. MCP Business. The gross margin of our MCP Business decreased during fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006, primarily due to a shift in product mix to higher volumes of integrated AMD based desktop products which have experienced lower gross margins than our discrete MCP products, and inventory reserves that we recorded as a charge to cost of revenue that primarily related to purchase commitments that we believed had exceeded future demand. CPB. The gross margin of our CPB increased during fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006, primarily due to an increase in unit sales of high end feature cellular phone and PDA products which generally have higher gross margins than our previous mobile products. In addition, license and royalty revenue from our contractual development arrangements that have higher gross margins compared to the gross margin of Xbox products shipped in fiscal year 2006. 49 Operating Expenses Year Ended Year Ended Jan. 27, 2008 Jan. 28, 2007 $ Change % Change Jan. 28, 2007 Jan. 29, 2006 $ Change % Change (In millions) (In millions) Research and development expenses $ 691.6 $ 553.5 $ 138.1 25 % $ 553.5 $ 357.1 $ 196.4 55 % Sales, general and administrative expenses 341.3 293.5 47.8 16 % 293.5 202.1 91.4 45 % Settlement costs 14.2 (14.2 ) (100 )% Total operating expenses $ 1,032.9 $ 847.0 $ 185.9 22 % $ 847.0 $ 573.4 $ 273.6 48 % Research and development as a percentage of net revenue 17 % 18 % 18 % 15 % Sales, general and administrative as a percentage of net revenue 8 % 10 % 10 % 9 % Research and Development Fiscal Year 2008 vs. Fiscal Year 2007 Research and development expenses were $691.6 million and $553.5 million during fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of $138.1 million, or 25%. The increase is primarily related to an increase in salaries and benefits by approximately $95.3 million as a result of personnel growth in departments related to research and development functions by approximately 600 additional personnel in fiscal year 2008. Additionally, salaries and benefits expenses also increased due to the increase in our variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance for fiscal year 2008. Facilities expenses and expenses related to computer software and equipment also increased as a result of the personnel growth. Fiscal Year 2007 vs. Fiscal Year 2006 Research and development expenses were $553.5 million and $357.1 million during fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of $196.4 million, or 55%. The increase was primarily due to increase in salaries and benefits by approximately $75.2 million as a result of personnel growth by approximately 1,000 additional personnel. Additionally, stock based compensation increased by $64.2 million due to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. Facilities expenses and expenses related to computer software and equipment increased as a result of the increase in personnel. In process Research and development, or IPR&D increased by $14.0 million as a result of our acquisitions of PortalPlayer and Hybrid Graphics during fiscal year 2007. Other expenses increased primarily due to travel and other employee related expenses associated with the expansion of our international sites including our acquisitions of ULi and Hybrid Graphics. We anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue. Sales, General and Administrative Fiscal Year 2008 vs. Fiscal Year 2007 Sales, general and administrative expenses were $341.3 million and $293.5 million during fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of $47.8 million, or 16%. The increase is primarily due to the increase in salaries and benefits by approximately $31.4 million related to the growth in personnel by approximately 180 additional personnel. Additionally, salaries and benefits expenses also increased due to the increase in our variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance for fiscal year 2008. Advertising and promotion expenses increased by $4.2 million primarily due to costs incurred for sponsorships and increased advertising campaign costs. The increase in personnel during the year and the expansion of our facilities worldwide to support additional personnel resulted in increases in our facilities expenses, stock based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expenses. Fiscal Year 2007 vs. Fiscal Year 2006 Sales, general and administrative expenses were $293.5 million and $202.1 million during fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of $91.4 million, or 45%. The increase is primarily due to increase in salaries and benefits by approximately $30.7 million related to approximately 200 additional personnel and an increase of $40.7 million related to stock based compensation resulting from our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. The growth in personnel during the year resulted in an increase in facilities expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses. We expect operating expenses to increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 as a result of the impact of acquisitions we have recently completed and as a result of an increase in salaries and benefit expenses. 50 In process research and development In connection with our acquisition of Mental Images in November 2007, PortalPlayer in January 2007 and Hybrid Graphics in March 2006, we wrote off $4.0 million, $13.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of in process research and development, or IPR&D, that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. In accordance with SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, as clarified by FIN 4, Applicability of SFAS No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method an interpretation of SFAS No. 2, amounts assigned to IPR&D meeting the above stated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price. Settlement Costs Settlement costs were $14.2 million for fiscal year 2006. The settlement costs are associated with two litigation matters, 3dfx and American Video Graphics, or AVG. AVG is settled. For further information about the 3dfx matter, please refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income increased to $64.3 million in fiscal year 2008, from $41.8 million in fiscal year 2007, primarily due to the result of higher average balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007. Interest income increased to $41.8 million in fiscal year 2007 from $20.7 million in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to the result of higher average balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates in fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006. Other Income (Expense), net Other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and foreign currency translation. Other income (expense) increased to $0.8 million in fiscal year 2008 from ($0.8) million in fiscal year 2007. The increase in other income during fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 is primarily due to approximately $2.0 million of realized gains on sale of an investment offset by an increase in foreign currency translation losses in fiscal year 2008. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $103.7 million, $46.4 million and $55.6 million during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 11.5% in fiscal year 2008, 9.4% in fiscal year 2007, and 15.6% in fiscal year 2006. The difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily a result of changes in our geographic mix of income subject to tax, with the additional change in mix due to certain stock based compensation expensed for financial accounting purposes under SFAS No. 123(R) and an increase in the research tax credit benefit in fiscal years 2008 and 2007. Please refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the components of our income tax expense. 51 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of January 27, 2008 As of January 28, 2007 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 727.0 $ 544.4 Marketable securities 1,082.5 573.4 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 1,809.5 $ 1,117.8 Year Ended January 27, January 28, January 29, 2008 2007 2006 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,270.2 $ 572.7 $ 446.4 Net cash used in investing activities (761.3 ) (526.4 ) (41.8 ) Net cash used in financing activities (326.3 ) (53.6 ) (61.4 ) As of January 27, 2008, we had $1.81 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $691.6 million from the end of fiscal year 2007. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top tier investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. Operating activities Operating activities generated cash of $1.27 billion, $572.7 million and $446.4 million during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities increased due to an increase in our net income during the comparable periods plus the impact of non cash charges to earnings and deferred income taxes. During fiscal year 2008, non cash charges to earnings included stock based compensation of $133.4 million and depreciation and amortization on our long term assets of $133.2 million. Additionally, operating cash flows for fiscal year 2008 also improved due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, including the timing of payments to vendors and an improvement in inventory turnover. These increases were offset by approximately $57.3 million in net cash outflows towards a confidential patent licensing agreement that we entered into in fiscal year 2007. The increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal year 2007 when compared to fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to an increase in our net income during the comparable periods plus the impact of non cash charges to earnings. Additionally, the increase is related to the $116.7 million of stock based compensation expense recorded upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in fiscal year 2007 and changes in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal years 2007 and 2006. Investing activities Investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases and sales of marketable securities, acquisition of businesses and purchases of property and equipment, which include leasehold improvements for our facilities and intangible assets. Investing activities used cash of $761.3 million, $526.4 million and $41.8 million during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Investing activities for fiscal year 2008 used cash of $496.4 million towards the net purchases of marketable securities, resulting from the need to invest the additional amounts of cash we received from operating activities, and $75.5 million for our acquisition of Mental Images. Investing activities also included $187.7 million of capital expenditures. Capital expenditures included purchase of property in anticipation of building additional facilities to accommodate our growing employee headcount, new research and development equipment, testing equipment to support our increased production requirements, technology licenses, software, intangible assets and leasehold improvements at our facilities in various international locations. 52 In fiscal year 2007, net cash used in investing activities included $401.8 million used for our acquisitions of PortalPlayer, ULi and Hybrid Graphics. Additionally, net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of $130.8 million attributable to new research and development equipment, hardware equipment, technology licenses, software, intangible assets and leasehold improvements at our various facilities. Net cash used by investing activities during fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to $79.6 million for capital expenditures primarily attributable to purchases of new research and development equipment, hardware equipment, technology licenses, software, intangible assets and leasehold improvements at our headquarters facility in Santa Clara, California and at our international sites. We expect to spend approximately $400 million to $450 million for capital expenditures during fiscal year 2009, primarily for the purchase of facilities, leasehold improvements, software licenses, emulation equipment, computers and engineering workstations. Our estimates for future capital expenditures include approximately $150.0 million for a property that includes approximately 25 acres of land and ten commercial buildings in Santa Clara, California, which we purchased on February 14, 2008. In addition, we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets. Financing activities Financing activities used cash of $326.3 million, $53.6 million and $61.4 million during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net cash used by financing activities in fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to $552.5 million paid towards our stock repurchase program, offset by cash proceeds of $226.0 million from common stock issued under our employee stock plans. During fiscal years 2007 and 2006, net cash used by financing activities towards payments under our stock repurchase program was $275.0 million and $188.5 million, respectively. These uses of cash in financing activities were offset by cash proceeds from common stock issued under our employee stock plans of $221.2 million and $127.5 million, for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Liquidity Cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity. Our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents, asset backed securities, commercial paper, mortgage backed securities issued by Government sponsored enterprises, equity securities, money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies. As of January 27, 2008, we did not have any investments in auction rate preferred securities. These investments are denominated in United States dollars. We account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. All of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under SFAS No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other than temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale, no gains or losses are realized in income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to be other than temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity, net of tax. At January 27, 2008 and January 28, 2007, we had $1.81 billion and $1.12 billion, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top tier investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of instrument. As of January 27, 2008, we were in compliance with our investment policy and did not have any issuer concentration in excess of 10% of our investment portfolio. Our investments in the financial sector and government agencies accounted for approximately 46% and 22%, respectively, of our total investment portfolio as of January 27, 2008. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with A/A2 or better rated issuers, and the substantial majority of the issuers are rated AA /Aa3 or better. As of January 27, 2008, $1.1 billion of our portfolio had a maturity of less than a year, and a substantial majority of our remaining investments have remaining maturities of three years or less. In fiscal year 2008, we did not recognize any other than temporary impairments on our portfolio of available for sale investments. Please refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on marketable securities. Recent U.S. sub prime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets, causing global credit and liquidity issues. The short term funding markets experienced issues during the third and fourth quarter of calendar 2007, leading to liquidity disruption in the market. If the global credit market continues to deteriorate, our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results. 53 Stock Repurchase Program During fiscal year 2005, we announced that our Board, had authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to certain specifications, up to an aggregate maximum amount of $300 million. During fiscal year 2007, the Board further approved an increase of $400 million to the original stock repurchase program. In fiscal year 2008, we announced that our Board authorized an additional stock repurchase program under which we may purchase up to an additional $1.0 billion of our common stock over a three year period through May 2010. As a result of these increases, we have an ongoing authorization from the Board, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate maximum amount of $1.7 billion. The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock repurchase programs, and may be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with the Exchange Act Rule 10b 18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As part of our share repurchase program, we have entered into, and we may continue to enter into, structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock, within a pre determined range, at the end of the term of the agreement. During the fiscal year ended January 27, 2008, we entered into a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase 18.9 million shares for $499.4 million which we recorded on the trade date of the transaction. In addition, we repurchased 1.8 million shares for $53.1 million in the open market in privately negotiated transactions. Through January 27, 2008, we had repurchased 61.7 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of $1.04 billion. Subsequent to January 27, 2008, we entered into a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase shares of our common stock for $123.9 million that we expect to settle prior to the end of our first quarter of fiscal year 2009 ending on April 27, 2008. Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then current stockholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and, as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include: decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and or our customers products; inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next generation products; competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors. Our estimates for future capital expenditures include approximately $150.0 million for a property that includes approximately 25 acres of land and ten commercial buildings in Santa Clara, California, which we purchased on February 14, 2008. In addition, we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets. For additional factors see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Products Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our stock could decline. 54 3dfx Asset Purchase On December 15, 2000, NVIDIA Corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or APA, which closed on April 18, 2001, to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx. Under the terms of the APA, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70.0 million, less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2000. The Asset Purchase Agreement also provided, subject to the other provisions thereof, that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for, then we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx one million shares, which due to subsequent stock splits now totals six million shares, of NVIDIA common stock. If 3dfx could not make such a certification, but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than $25.0 million, then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock, with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by $25.00 per share. If 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for, or could not be satisfied, for less than $25.0 million, we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets. In October 2002, 3dfx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. In March 2003, we were served with a complaint filed by the Trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy Court which sought, among other things, payments from us as additional purchase price related to our purchase of certain assets of 3dfx. In early November 2005, after several months of mediation, NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, or the Creditors Committee, agreed to a Plan of Liquidation of 3dfx, which included a conditional settlement of the Trustees claims against us. This conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the Bankruptcy Court after notice and hearing. The conditional settlement called for a payment by NVIDIA of approximately $30.6 million to the 3dfx estate. Under the settlement, $5.6 million related to various administrative expenses and Trustee fees, and $25.0 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx. Accordingly, during the three month period ended October 30, 2005, we recorded $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx. The Trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement. However, the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process. On December 21, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court determined that it would schedule trial of one portion of the Trustees case against NVIDIA. On January 2, 2007, NVIDIA exercised its right to terminate the settlement agreement on grounds that the Bankruptcy Court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the Creditors Committees plan. A non jury trial began on March 21, 2007 on valuation issues in the Trustees constructive fraudulent transfer claims against NVIDIA. Specifically, the Bankruptcy Court tried four questions: (1) what did 3dfx transfer to NVIDIA in the APA?; (2) of what was transferred, what qualifies as "property" subject to the Bankruptcy Courts avoidance powers under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions?; (3) what is the fair market value of the "property" identified in answer to question (2)?; and (4) was the $70 million that NVIDIA paid "reasonably equivalent" to the fair market value of that property? At the conclusion of the evidence, the Bankruptcy Court asked the parties to submit post trial briefing. That briefing was completed on May 25, 2007, and the Bankruptcy Courts decision is still pending. Please refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this litigation. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 27, 2008: Contractual Obligations Total Within 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years All Other (In thousands) Operating leases $ 188,623 $ 42,912 $ 84,524 $ 54,763 $ 6,424 $ Purchase obligations (1) 651,642 651,642 FIN 48 liability and interest (2) 88,993 88,993 Capital purchase obligations 11,840 11,840 Total contractual obligations $ 941,098 $ 706,394 $ 84,524 $ 54,763 $ 6,424 $ 88,993 (1) Represents our inventory purchase commitments as of January 27, 2008. (2) Represents our FIN 48 liability and FIN 48 net interest/penalty payable for $77.8 million and $11.2 million, respectively, as of January 27, 2008. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of FIN 48 liability and interest/penalty payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. During fiscal year 2007, we entered into a confidential patent licensing arrangement. Our commitment for license payments under this arrangement could range from $97.0 million to $110.0 million over a ten year period; however, the net outlay under this arrangement may be reduced by the occurrence of certain events covered by the arrangement. Through January 27, 2008, we had made payments of $81.3 million towards this arrangement. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 27, 2008, we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S K 303(a)(4)(ii). 55 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, or SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The changes to current practice resulting from the application of SFAS No. 157 relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, in December 2007, the FASB issued a proposed staff position that delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for non financial assets and non financial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 157 beginning with our fiscal quarter ending April 27, 2008 related to financial assets and liabilities. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, or SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 159 beginning with our fiscal quarter ending April 27, 2008. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In June 2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 07 3, or EITF 07 3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities. EITF 07 3 requires non refundable advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities to be recorded as an asset and the payments to be expensed when the research and development activities are performed. We are required to adopt the provisions of EITF 07 3 beginning with our fiscal quarter ending April 27, 2008. The adoption of EITF 07 3 is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), or SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations. Under SFAS No. 141(R), an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that acquisition related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred, restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense. In addition, acquired in process research and development, or IPR&D is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 141(R) beginning with our fiscal quarter ending April 26, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) is expected to change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the period it is adopted. 56 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment and Interest Rate Risk At January 27, 2008 and January 28, 2007, we had $1.81 billion and $1.12 billion, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We invest in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents, asset backed securities, commercial paper, mortgage backed securities issued by Government sponsored enterprises, equity securities, money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies. As of January 27, 2008, we did not have any investments in auction rate preferred securities. These investments are denominated in United States dollars. We account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, or SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. All of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under SFAS No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other than temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale, no gains or losses are realized in income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other than temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity, net of tax. As of January 27, 2008, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both +/ 0.5% would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately $3.1 million. Recent U.S. sub prime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets, causing global credit and liquidity issues. The short term funding markets experienced issues during the third and fourth quarter of calendar 2007, leading to liquidity disruption in the market. If the global credit market continues to deteriorate, our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. As of January 27, 2008, we did not have any issuer concentration in excess of 10% of our investment portfolio. However, our investments in the financial sector and government agencies accounted for approximately 46% and 22%, respectively, of our total investment portfolio. If the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 2% 5%, it would result in changes in fair market values for these investments by approximately $22 $54 million. Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Financial Statements and to date have not been significant. The aggregate exchange loss included in determining net income was $1.7 million in fiscal year 2008 and $0.5 million in fiscal year 2007. The impact of exchange gain/loss was not material in fiscal year 2006. Currently, sales and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future. We may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. There were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at January 27, 2008. 57
