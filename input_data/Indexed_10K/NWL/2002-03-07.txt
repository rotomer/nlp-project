ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated items from the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of net sales: Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of products sold 73.0 73.7 74.1 Gross Income 27.0 26.3 25.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.9 13.0 16.5 Restructuring costs 1.0 0.6 3.6 Goodwill amortization 0.8 0.7 0.7 Operating Income 8.3 12.0 5.1 Nonoperating expenses: Interest expense 2.0 1.9 1.5 Other, net 0.3 0.2 0.2 Net Nonoperating Expenses 2.3 2.1 1.7 Income before income taxes 6.0 9.9 3.4 Income taxes 2.2 3.8 2.0 Net Income 3.8% 6.1% 1.4% 2001 VERSUS 2000 Net sales for 2001 were $6,909.3 million, representing a decrease of $25.4 million, or 0.4%, from $6,934.7 million in 2000. The sales decline was primarily due to shelf space losses at key customers and a significant downturn in the US economy partially offset by $498.5 million of sales contributions from Paper Mate/Parker (acquired December 2000). Net sales for each of the Companys segments (and the primary reasons for the year to year changes) were as follows: 31 Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 % Change (In millions) Rubbermaid (1) $1,819.3 $1,946.5 (6.5)% Parker/Eldon (2) 1,673.5 1,288.0 29.9 Levolor/Hardware (1) 1,382.6 1,455.0 (5.0) Calphalon/WearEver (1) 1,161.7 1,246.9 (6.8) Little Tikes/Graco (1) 872.2 998.3 (12.6) $6,909.3 $6,934.7 (0.4)% Primary reasons for changes: (1) Internal sales decline primarily due to shelf space losses at key customers and a significant downturn in the US economy.* (2) $498.5 million of sales contribution from the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition+ (December 2000) offset by internal sales decline of 8.8% primarily due to softness in the commercial channel and a significant downturn in the US economy. * Internal sales growth/decline is defined by the Company as growth/decline from its core businesses, which include continuing businesses owned more than one year and minor acquisitions. + Acquisitions and divestitures are described in Footnote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Gross income as a percentage of net sales in 2001 was 27.0%, or $1,862.7 million, versus 26.3%, or $1,826.0 million, in 2000. Excluding restructuring related and other charges relating to integration costs of recent acquisitions of $7.4 million ($4.7 million after taxes) and $7.9 million ($4.9 million after taxes) in 2001 and 2000, respectively, gross income as a percent of net sales was 27.1%, or $1,870.1 million in 2001 versus 26.4%, or $1,833.9 million in 2000. This improvement in gross income is primarily due to the implementation of a productivity initiative throughout the Company and contributions from the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition. The Companys productivity objective is to reduce the cost of manufacturing a product by at least five percent per year on an ongoing basis in order to become the low cost supplier to our customers. To achieve productivity improvements, the Company will focus on reducing purchasing costs, materials handling costs, manufacturing inefficiencies, and excess overhead costs to reduce the overall cost of manufacturing products. The Companys productivity in 2001 was affected primarily by the increased costs associated with slowed manufacturing in an effort to reduce inventory levels (net inventories decreased $148.8 million during 2001) offset by improved raw material costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") in 2001 were 16.9% of net sales, or $1,168.2 million, versus 13.0%, or $899.4 32 million, in 2000. Excluding charges relating to integration costs of recent acquisitions of $12.0 million ($7.7 million after taxes) and $8.8 million ($5.4 million after taxes) in 2001 and 2000, respectively, SG&A as a percent of net sales was 16.7% or $1,156.2 million in 2001 compared to 12.8% or $890.6 million in 2000. The increase in SG&A is a result of the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition and planned investments in marketing initiatives, including the Companys Key Account and Phoenix Programs, supporting the Companys brand portfolio and key account strategy. In 2001, the Company introduced the Key Account Program, establishing sales organizations specifically for Wal*Mart, The Home Depot and Lowes. As part of this program, the company established President level positions to more effectively manage the relationships with these accounts. The program allows the Company to present these customers with "one face" to enhance the Companys response time and understanding of the customers needs, to support the best possible relationship. In 2001, the Company also introduced its Phoenix Program. This initiative is an action oriented field sales force consisting of approximately 500 recent university graduates. The team works in the field, primarily within our Key Account structure, performing product demonstrations, merchandising product, interacting with the end user, and maintaining an ongoing relationship with store personnel. This initiative allows the Company to enhance product placement and minimize stock outages and, together with the Key Account Program, to maximize shelf space potential. This program, implemented July 2001, gained traction throughout the year. Impact from this initiative is expected to translate to the Consolidated Financial Statements through the impact of shelf space gains going forward. During 2001, the Company recorded pre tax restructuring charges associated with the Companys strategic restructuring plan. The restructuring plan is intended to streamline the Companys supply chain to ensure its position as the low cost global provider throughout the Companys product portfolio. The plan consists of reducing worldwide headcount over the three years beginning in 2001, and includes consolidating duplicate manufacturing facilities. As part of this plan, the Company incurred employee severance and termination benefit costs for approximately 1,700 employees. Additionally, the Company incurred facility exit costs related primarily to the closure of 14 facilities (four at Rubbermaid, one at Parker/Eldon, six at Levolor/Hardware and three at Calphalon/WearEver). See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a review of the charges. During 2000, the Company recorded pre tax restructuring charges related primarily to the continued Rubbermaid integration and plant closures in the Home Decor segment. The Company incurred employee severance and termination benefit costs related to approximately 700 employees terminated in 2000. Such costs included severance and 33 government mandated settlements for facility closures at Rubbermaid Europe, change in control payments made to former Rubbermaid executives, employee terminations at the domestic Rubbermaid divisions and severance at the Home Decor segment. The Company incurred merger transaction costs related primarily to legal settlements for Rubbermaids 1998 sale of a former division and other merger related contingencies resolved in 2000. Additionally, the Company incurred facility and other exit costs related primarily to the closure of five European Rubbermaid facilities, three window furnishings facilities as well as the exit of various Rubbermaid product lines. See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a review of the charges. For the year ended December 31, 2001 goodwill amortization and other as a percentage of net sales were 0.8%, or $57.0 million, versus 0.7%, or $51.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in goodwill amortization is a result of additional goodwill associated with the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition in December 2000. Operating income in 2001 was 8.3% of net sales, or $570.9 million, versus 12.0% of net sales, or $831.7 million, in 2000. Excluding restructuring and other charges of $86.1 million ($54.8 million after taxes) in 2001 and $59.7 million ($36.7 million after taxes) in 2000, operating income was $657.0, or 9.5%, of net sales in 2001 versus $891.4 million, or 12.9%, of net sales in 2000. The decrease in operating margins was primarily due to planned investment in marketing initiatives supporting the Companys brand portfolio and key account strategy. Net nonoperating expenses in 2001 were 2.3% of net sales, or $155.0 million, versus 2.1%, or $146.2, million in 2000. The increased expenses in 2001 are a result of the Companys increased average level of debt, partially offset by lower interest rates. The effective tax rate was 36.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001 versus 38.5% in the prior year. See Footnote 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation of the effective tax rate. Net income for 2001 was $264.6 million compared to net income of $421.6 million in 2000. Basic and diluted earnings per share in 2001 decreased to $0.99 versus $1.57 in 2000. Excluding 2001 pre tax charges of $86.1 million ($54.8 million after taxes) as discussed above, net income in 2001 was $319.4 million. Excluding 2000 pre tax charges of $59.7 million ($36.7 million after taxes), net income in 2000 was $458.3 million. Diluted earnings per share, calculated on the same basis, decreased 29.8% to $1.20 versus $1.71 in 2000. The decrease in net income and earnings per share for 2001 was primarily due to internal sales declines and planned investment in the Companys marketing initiatives. 34 2000 VERSUS 1999 Net sales for 2000 were $6,934.7 million, representing an increase of $222.9 million, or 3.3%, from $6,711.8 million in 1999. Net sales for each of the Companys segments (and the primary reasons for the year to year changes) were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2000 1999 % Change (IN MILLIONS) Rubbermaid $1,946.5 $2,004.3 (2.9)% Parker/Eldon (1) 1,288.0 1,218.0 5.7 Levolor/Hardware 1,455.0 1,400.6 3.9 Calphalon/WearEver (2) 1,246.9 1,186.0 5.1 Little Tikes/Graco (3) 998.3 902.9 10.6 $6,934.7 $6,711.8 3.3% Primary reasons for changes: (1) Internal sales growth of 3.8% enhanced by $30.6 million of sales contribution from the acquisitions of Rotring and Reynolds. (2) Internal sales decline of 1.4% offset by $77.1 million of sales contribution from the acquisitions of Ceanothe, Mersch, Brio and Panex. (3) Internal sales growth due to shelf space gains at key retailers. Gross income as a percent of net sales in 2000 was 26.3%, or $1,826.0 million, versus 25.9%, or $1,736.4, million in 1999. Excluding costs associated with the Rubbermaid merger and certain realignment and other charges of $7.9 million and $111.0 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, gross income as a percent of net sales was 26.4%, or $1,833.9 million, in 2000 versus 27.5%, or $1,847.4 million, in 1999. This decrease in gross margins in 2000 was primarily attributable to lower sales volume and higher material costs. SG&A in 2000 was 13.0% of net sales, or $899.4 million versus 16.5%, or $1,104.5 million, in 1999. Excluding costs associated with the Rubbermaid merger and certain realignment and other charges of $8.8 million and $178.8 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, SG&A as a percent of net sales was 12.8%, or $890.6 million, in 2000 versus 13.8%, or $925.7 million, in 1999. The decrease in SG&A expenses is primarily the result of integration cost savings at Rubbermaid Home Products, Rubbermaid Europe and Little Tikes and tight spending control throughout the rest of the Companys core businesses. During 2000, the Company recorded pre tax restructuring charges related primarily to the continued Rubbermaid integration and plant closures in the Home Decor segment. The Company incurred employee 35 severance and termination benefit costs related to approximately 700 employees terminated in 2000. Such costs included severance and government mandated settlements for facility closures at Rubbermaid Europe, change in control payments made to former Rubbermaid executives, employee terminations at the domestic Rubbermaid divisions and severance at the Home Decor segment. The Company incurred merger transaction costs related primarily to legal settlements for Rubbermaids 1998 sale of a former division and other merger related contingencies resolved in 2000. Additionally, the Company incurred facility and other exit costs related primarily to the closure of five European Rubbermaid facilities, three window furnishings facilities as well as the exit of various Rubbermaid product lines. See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a review of the charges. During 1999, the Company recorded pre tax restructuring charges related primarily to the integration of the Rubbermaid business into Newell. Merger transaction costs related primarily to investment banking, legal and accounting costs for the Newell/Rubbermaid merger. Employee severance and termination benefits related to approximately 750 employees terminated in 1999. Such costs included change in control payments made to former Rubbermaid executives and severance and termination costs at Rubbermaids former headquarters, Rubbermaid Home Products division, Little Tikes division, Rubbermaid Commercial Products division and Newell divisions. Facility and other exit costs representing impaired Rubbermaid centralized computer software (abandoned as a result of converting Rubbermaid onto existing Newell centralized computer software) and costs related to discontinued product lines, the closure of seven Rubbermaid facilities, write off of assets associated with abandoned projects and impaired assets and other exit costs. See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a review of the charges. Goodwill amortization as a percentage of net sales was 0.7% in 2000 and 1999. Operating income in 2000 was 12.0% of net sales, or $831.7 million, versus 5.1% of net sales, or $343.6 million, in 1999. Excluding restructuring and other charges of $59.7 million in 2000 and $531.4 million in 1999, operating income was $891.4, or 12.9%, of net sales in 2000 versus $875.0 million, or 13.0%, of net sales in 1999. Net nonoperating expenses in 2000 were 2.1% of net sales, or $146.2 million, versus 1.7%, or $112.7 million, in 1999. The increased expenses in 2000 are a result of the Companys increased level of debt and higher interest rates. For 2000 and 1999 the effective tax rates were 38.5% and 58.7%, respectively. The higher rate in 1999 was primarily due to nondeductible transaction costs associated with the Rubbermaid merger. See Footnote 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation of the effective tax rate. 36 Net income for 2000 was $421.6 million, representing an increase of $326.2 million from 1999. Basic and diluted earnings per share in 2000 increased to $1.57 versus $0.34 in 1999. Excluding 2000 pre tax charges of $59.7 million ($36.7 million after taxes) as discussed above, net income in 2000 was $458.3 million. Excluding 1999 pre tax charges of $531.4 million ($369.6 million after taxes), net income in 1999 was $465.0 million. Diluted earnings per share, calculated on the same basis, increased 3.6% to $1.71 in 2000 versus $1.65 in 1999. The decrease in net income for 2000 was primarily due to increased raw material costs and lower sales volume, offset partially by Rubbermaid integration cost savings, tight spending control at other core businesses and internal growth. Diluted earnings per share increased in 2000 versus 1999 as a result of the lower share base due to the stock repurchase program. 37 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources The Companys primary sources of liquidity and capital resources include cash provided from operations and use of available borrowing facilities. Cash provided by operating activities in 2001 was $865.4 million, compared to $623.5 and $554.0 million for 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to improved working capital management, principally in the areas of inventory and accounts payable. In 2001, the Company announced an increased focus on working capital which resulted in reduced inventory of $148.8 million and increased accounts payable of $158.9 million. As a result, the Company generated free cash flow (defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends) of $391.6 million compared to $81.8 million and $128.1 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company has short term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of credit with various banks which are available for short term financing. Borrowings under the Companys uncommitted lines of credit are subject to the discretion of the lender. The Companys lines of credit do not have a material impact on the Companys liquidity. Borrowings under the Companys lines of credit at December 31, 2001 totaled $19.1 million. The Company has a revolving credit agreement of $1,300.0 million that will terminate in August 2002. The Company intends to extend the revolving credit agreement beyond 2002. During 2000, the Company entered into a 364 day revolving credit agreement in the amount of $700.0 million which expired in October 2001. As of December 31, 2001, there were no borrowings under the remaining $1,300.0 million revolving credit agreement. In lieu of borrowings under the Companys revolving credit agreement, the Company may issue up to $1,300.0 million of commercial paper. The Companys revolving credit agreement provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the Companys revolving credit agreement. At December 31, 2001, $707.5 million (principal amount) of commercial paper was outstanding. Because the backup revolving credit agreement expires in August 2002, the entire $707.5 million is classified as current portion of long term debt. The company plans to extend maturities by replacing a portion of current debt with longer term debt facilities. By extending maturities, the Company can reduce its reliance on the current commercial paper program. 38 The revolving credit agreement permits the Company to borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms. The agreement requires, among other things, that the Company maintain a certain Total Indebtedness to Total Capital Ratio and limits Subsidiary Indebtedness, as defined in the agreement. As of December 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with this agreement. The Company had outstanding at December 31, 2001 a total of $1,012.5 million (principal amount) of medium term notes. The maturities on these notes range from 3 to 30 years at an average interest rate of 6.34%. Of the outstanding amount of medium term notes, $100.0 million is classified as current portion of long term debt and the remainder of $912.5 million is classified as long term debt. A $779.5 million universal shelf registration statement became effective in July 1999. As of December 31, 2001, $449.5 million of Company debt and equity securities may be issued under the shelf. On September 18, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with a financial institution creating a financing entity which is consolidated in the Companys financial statements. Under the agreement, the Company regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity to sell an undivided interest in the Companys receivables. In the quarter ended September 30, 2001, the financing entity issued $450.0 million in preferred debt securities to a financial institution. Those preferred debt securities must be retired or redeemed before the Company can have access to the financing entitys receivables. The receivables and the corresponding $450.0 million preferred debt issued by the subsidiary to the financial institution are recorded on the consolidated accounts of the Company. The proceeds of this debt were used to pay down commercial paper. Because this debt matures in 2008, the entire amount is considered to be long term debt. The provisions of the debt agreement allow the entire outstanding debt to be called upon certain events including the Companys long term senior unsecured debt rating falling below Baa2 (Moodys) or BBB (Standard & Poors) and certain levels of accounts receivable write offs. As of December 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with the agreement. Uses The Companys primary uses of liquidity and capital resources include acquisitions, dividend payments and capital expenditures. In 2001, cash used for 2001 acquisitions and deferred payments on prior acquisitions was $107.5 million. The Company made several minor acquisitions in 2001 for cash purchase prices totaling $61.2 million. In 2000, cash used for 2000 acquisitions and deferred payments on prior acquisitions was $597.8 million. The Company acquired Mersch, Brio and Paper Mate/Parker and made other minor acquisitions in 2000 for cash purchase prices totaling $635.2 million. In 1999, cash used for 1999 acquisitions and deferred payments on prior acquisitions was 39 $345.9 million. The Company acquired Ateliers, Reynolds, McKechnie, Ceanothe and made other minor acquisitions for cash purchase prices totaling $397.3 million. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2001: Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period (in millions) Less than After Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years Notes Payable to Banks $ 9.1 $ 19.1 Long term Debt 2,172.5 807.5 415.5 172.0 777.5 Operating Leases 180.3 56.6 68.9 30.7 24.1 Total Contractual Obligations $2,379.1 $891.9 $484.1 $201.7 $801.4 In 2001, the Company made payments on long term debt, net of proceeds, of $354.7 million, compared to net additional borrowings of $836.8 million in 2000 and $194.7 million in 1999. The Companys ability to pay down additional debt was due primarily to increased focus on working capital management (primarily inventory and accounts payable) and current year cash earnings. Cash used for restructuring activities was $49.7 million, $32.9 million and $145.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Such payments represent primarily employee termination benefits and facility closure and other exit costs related to the Companys strategic restructuring plan and recent acquisitions. Capital expenditures were $249.8 million, $316.6 million and $200.1 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Aggregate dividends paid during 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $224.0, $225.1 million and $225.8 million, respectively. On February 7, 2000, the Company announced a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of the Companys outstanding common stock. During 2000, the Company repurchased 15.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $26 per share, for a total cash price of $403.0 million under the program. The repurchase program remained in effect until December 31, 2000 and was financed through the use of working capital and commercial paper. Retained earnings increased in 2001 and 2000 by $40.4 million and $196.3 million, respectively. The decrease in the earnings growth rate between 2001 and 2000 was primarily due to reduced net income from lower than expected sales volume and planned investment in marketing initiatives supporting the Companys brand portfolio and key account strategy. Working capital at December 31, 2001 was $316.8 million compared to $1,329.5 million at December 31, 2000 and $1,108.7 million at December 31, 1999. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to 40 reclassifying $707.5 million in long term debt in 2000 as current in 2001 as discussed above, and the Companys increased focus on working capital management. The current ratio at December 31, 2000 was 1.13:1 compared to 1.86:1 at December 31, 2000 and 1.68:1 at December 31, 1999. Total debt to total capitalization (total debt is net of cash and cash equivalents, and total capitalization includes total debt, company obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a subsidiary trust and stockholders equity) was .43:1 at December 31, 2001, .46:1 at December 31, 2000 and .33:1 at December 31, 1999. The Company believes that cash provided from operations and borrowing facilities will continue to provide adequate support for the cash needs of existing businesses; however, certain events, such as significant acquisitions, could require additional external financing. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 of the Footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Footnote 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Companys financial statements include estimates as to the recovery of accounts receivable, inventory, goodwill and other long lived assets as well as those used in the determination of liabilities related to litigation, product liability, customer discounts, taxation, restructuring, post retirement and pension benefits and environmental matters. Various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates. The process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, product mix, and in some cases, actuarial techniques. The Company re evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate. Historically, actual results have not differed significantly from those determined using the estimates described above. Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers, net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts (such as volume or trade), co op advertising and other sales discounts are 41 recognized as revenue upon shipment to customers and when all substantial risks of ownership change. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS At the beginning of 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. Any changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded in the income statement or other comprehensive income. The impact of adopting FAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 resulted in a cumulative after tax gain of approximately $13.0 million, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The cumulative effect of adopting FAS No. 133 did not materially impact the results of operations. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards ("FASB") issued FAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", and FAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". FAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Historically, all acquisitions by the Company have been accounted for as purchases, thus there was no effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption of this standard, in contrast, all mergers have been accounted for as poolings of interest. FAS No. 142 becomes effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to early adopt the provisions of FAS No. 142 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. In accordance with this standard, goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. All other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill amortization expense was $57.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001. The Company anticipates that the application of the nonamortization provisions will increase annual net income by approximately $41.0 million or $0.15 per share. During 2001 and the first quarter 2002, the Company performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of January 1, 2002. Subject to final analysis, the Company expects to record a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of $500.0 million to $550.0 million in the first quarter of 2002. In August 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment of Disposal of Long Lived Assets." This statement established a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and provides additional implementation guidance for assets to be held and used and assets to be disposed of other than by sale. The statement supersedes FAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and amends the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 30 related to the 42 disposal of a segment of a business. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company adopted FAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002, and the standard did not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") issued EITF No. 01 09 "Accounting for Consideration Given by Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of Vendors Product" which codified and reconciled the Task Forces consensuses in EITF 00 14 "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives", EITF 00 22 "Accounting for Points and Certain Other Time Based Sales Incentives or Volume Based Sales Incentive Offers, and Offers of Free Products or Services to Be Delivered in the Future", and EITF 00 25 "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products". These EITFs prescribe guidance regarding the timing of recognition and income statement classification of costs incurred for certain sales incentive programs to resellers and end consumers. EITF No. 01 09 did not impact results of operations because the Company recognizes sales incentives upon recognition of revenue and classifies them as reductions of gross revenue and recognizes free goods as a cost of goods sold when shipped, both in accordance with the prescribed rules. In May 2000, the EITF issued EITF No. 00 10 "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs." EITF No. 00 10 requires that amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs be classified as revenue and all expenses related to shipping and handling be classified as a cost of products sold. Historically, these revenues and costs had been netted together and deducted from gross sales to arrive at net sales. The net sales and cost of products sold have been restated for this change. The impact of this change increased net sales and cost of products sold by $286.1 million and $298.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, respectively. There was no impact on gross income resulting from this change. LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims, including various environmental matters, in the ordinary course of its business. Such legal proceedings are more fully described in Footnote 15 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Although management of the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings with certainty, it believes that the ultimate resolution of the Companys legal proceedings, including any amounts it may have to pay in excess of amounts reserved, will not have a material effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS The Companys non U.S. business is growing at a faster pace than its business in the United States. This growth outside the U.S. has been fueled by recent international acquisitions, primarily in Europe. For 43 the years ended December 31, 2001, December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, the Companys non U.S. business accounted for approximately 27%, 25% and 23% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Growth of both U.S. and non U.S. businesses is shown below: Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 % Change (IN MILLIONS) Net sales: U.S. $5,040.6 $5,191.5 (2.9)% Non U.S. 1,868.7 1,743.2 7.2 $6,909.3 $6,934.7 (0.4)% Year Ended December 31, 2000 1999 % Change (IN MILLIONS) Net sales: U.S. $5,191.5 $5,135.4 1.1% Non U.S. 1,743.2 1,576.4 10.6 $6,934.7 $6,711.8 3.3% 44 MARKET RISK The Companys market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices. Pursuant to the Companys policies, natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Companys primary market risk is interest rate exposure, primarily in the United States. The Company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate exposure was reduced significantly in 1997 from the issuance of $500.0 million 5.25% Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities of a Subsidiary Trust, the proceeds of which reduced commercial paper. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions, and, for qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense. The Companys foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less. The Company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form: * offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows, * structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk, * converting excess foreign currency deposits into U.S. dollars or the relevant functional currency and * avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency. In addition, the Company utilizes short term forward contracts to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions. Derivative instruments are recorded on the Companys balance sheet at fair value, and any changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded in the income statement or other comprehensive income. Due to the diversity of its product lines, the Company does not have material sensitivity to any one commodity. The Company manages commodity price exposures primarily through the duration and terms of its vendor contracts. The amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the Company could incur from adverse changes in either 45 interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model. The value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and including substantially all market risk exposures (specifically excluding equity method investments). The fair value losses shown in the table below do not have an impact on current results of operations or financial condition, but are shown as an illustration of the impact of adverse changes in interest rates. Time Confidence Amount Period Level (IN MILLIONS) Interest rates $14.5 1 day 95% Foreign exchange $0.5 1 day 95% The 95% confidence interval signifies the Companys degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the Companys favor. The value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse. Actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is highly unlikely that the Company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. 46 EURO CURRENCY CONVERSION On January 1, 1999, the "Euro" became the common legal currency for 11 of the 15 member countries of the European Union. On that date, the participating countries fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies ("legacy currencies") and the Euro. On January 4, 1999, the Euro began trading on currency exchanges and became available for noncash transactions, if the parties elected to use it. On January 1, 2001, another country (Greece) also adopted the Euro, fixing the conversion rate against their legacy currency. The legacy currencies remained legal tender through December 31, 2001. On January 1, 2002, participating countries introduced Euro denominated bills and coins, and effective July 1, 2002, legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender. After the dual currency phase, all businesses in participating countries must conduct all transactions in the Euro and must convert their financial records and reports to be Euro based. The Company has substantially completed this conversion process and has deemed its information systems to be Euro compliant. As a result of the Euro conversion, the Company experienced no adverse impact to its business or financial condition on a consolidated basis.
