ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated items from the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31,: 2002 2001 2000 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of products sold 72.4 73.0 73.7 Gross income 27.6 27.0 26.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 17.5 16.9 13.0 Restructuring costs 1.6 1.0 0.6 Goodwill amortization 0.8 0.7 Operating income 8.5 8.3 12.0 Nonoperating expenses: Interest expense 1.5 2.0 1.9 Other, net 0.7 0.3 0.2 Net nonoperating expenses 2.2 2.3 2.1 Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 6.3 6.0 9.9 Income taxes 2.1 2.2 3.8 Income before cumulative effect of accounting change 4.2 3.8 6.1 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax (6.9) Net (loss)/income (2.7)% 3.8% 6.1% 2002 VERSUS 2001 Net sales for 2002 were $7,453.9 million, representing an increase of $544.6 million, or 7.9%, from $6,909.3 million in 2001. The increase primarily resulted from internal sales growth of 3.3% and sales contribution from American Tool Companies, Inc. of $318.3 million (acquired April 2002). 27 Gross income as a percentage of net sales in 2002 was 27.6%, or $2,059.7 million, versus 27.0%, or $1,862.7 million, in 2001. Gross income includes restructuring related and other charges relating to integration costs of recent acquisitions of $13.8 million ($9.2 million after taxes) and $7.4 million ($4.7 million after taxes) in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The improvement in gross income is primarily related to the implementation of a productivity initiative throughout the Company and higher margins from our new products. The Companys productivity objective is to reduce the cost of manufacturing a product by at least five percent per year on an ongoing basis in order to become the best cost supplier to our customers. To achieve productivity improvements, the Company is focusing on reducing purchasing costs, materials handling costs, manufacturing inefficiencies, and excess overhead costs to reduce the overall cost of manufacturing products. Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") in 2002 were 17.5% of net sales, or $1,307.3 million, versus 16.9%, or $1,168.2 million, in 2001. SG&A includes charges relating to integration costs of recent acquisitions of $7.4 million ($4.9 million after taxes) and $12.0 million ($7.7 million after taxes) in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in SG&A is a result of the American Tool Companies, Inc. acquisition ($75.5 million) and planned investments in marketing initiatives, including the Companys Strategic Account Management Program, television advertising program and Phoenix Program, supporting the Companys brand portfolio and strategic account management strategy. The Company continues to invest in several programs launched in 2001. The Strategic Account Management Program is the Companys sales and marketing approach that focuses growth efforts on strategic accounts with high long term growth potential. Separate sales organizations have been established to more effectively manage the relationship at the largest strategic accounts, specifically Wal*Mart, The Home Depot and Lowes. As part of this program, the Company established President level positions to more effectively manage the relationships with these accounts. The program allows the Company to present these customers with "one face" to enhance the Companys response time, understand the customers needs and support the best possible customer relationship. In addition to the Strategic Account Management Program, the Company also continues to invest in its Phoenix Program. This initiative is an action oriented field sales force consisting of approximately 500 recent university graduates. The team works in the field, primarily within our Strategic Account structure, performing in store product demonstrations, event marketing, on shelf merchandising, interacting with the end user, and maintaining an ongoing relationship with store personnel. This initiative allows the Company to enhance product placement and minimize stock outages and, together with the Strategic Account Management Program, to maximize shelf space potential. This program continues to gain traction throughout several accounts and is 28 expected to translate to the Consolidated Financial Statements through the impact of shelf space gains going forward. During 2002, the Company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $122.7 million associated with the Companys strategic restructuring plan. The restructuring plan is intended to streamline the Companys supply chain to ensure its position as the best cost global provider throughout the Companys product portfolio. The plan consists of reducing worldwide headcount over the three years beginning in 2001, and includes consolidating duplicate manufacturing facilities. As part of this plan, the Company incurred employee severance and termination benefit costs for approximately 3,100 employees. Additionally, the Company incurred facility exit costs related primarily to the closure of 43 facilities (seven at Rubbermaid, eight at Sharpie, fourteen at Irwin, twelve at Calphalon Home and two corporate administrative offices). See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a review of these charges. Operating income in 2002 was 8.5% of net sales, or $629.7 million, versus 8.3% of net sales, or $570.9 million, in 2001. Operating income includes restructuring and other charges of $143.9 million ($95.8 million after taxes) and $86.1 million ($54.8 million after taxes) in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in operating margins was primarily due to improvement in gross margin and the elimination of amortization expense associated with goodwill (see Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion) offset by planned investment in marketing initiatives supporting the Companys brand portfolio and strategic account management strategy and restructuring charges to streamline the Companys supply chain. Net nonoperating expenses in 2002 were 2.2% of net sales, or $161.2 million, versus 2.3%, or $155.0 million, in 2001. Net nonoperating expense includes charges relating to integration costs of recent acquisitions and costs related to the Anchor Hocking withdrawn divestiture of $23.7 million ($15.9 million after tax) in 2002. These costs were partially offset by lower interest rates. See Footnotes 2 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The effective tax rate was 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus 36.4% in the prior year. See Footnote 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation of the effective tax rate. Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change in 2002 was $311.5 million, a $46.9 million, or 17.7% increase from $264.6 million in 2001. Diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of accounting change was $1.16 in 2002 compared to $0.99 in 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company completed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, which resulted in an impairment charge of $514.9 million, net of tax. See Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further 29 information on the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and other Intangible Assets." Net loss for 2002 was $203.4 million compared to net income of $264.6 million in 2001. Basic and diluted loss/earnings per share in 2002 decreased to a loss of $0.76 versus income of $0.99 in 2001. The decrease in net income and earnings per share in 2002 was primarily due to the cumulative effect of accounting changes related to goodwill, and increased restructuring charges to streamline the Companys supply chain, partially offset by an improvement in gross margins, the elimination of amortization expense associated with goodwill, lower interest rates and a reduction in income tax expense. See Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to cumulative effect of accounting change charge for goodwill. BUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS: The Company operates in four general segments: Net Sales by Segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS): 2002 2001 % Change Rubbermaid $2,592.4 $2,565.6 1.0% Sharpie 1,908.7 1,799.4 6.1 Irwin 1,727.3 1,382.6 24.9 Calphalon Home 1,225.5 1,161.7 5.5 Total Net Sales $7,453.9 $6,909.3 7.9% Operating Income by Segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS): 2002 2001 % Change Rubbermaid $214.5 $200.9 6.8% Sharpie 323.3 278.3 16.2 Irwin 136.4 126.5 7.8 Calphalon Home 119.5 120.1 (0.5) Segment Operating Income* $793.7 $725.8 9.4% * Segment Operating Income excludes corporate costs and Restructuring Expense. See Footnote 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the detail of Operating Income by Segment including Corporate and Restructuring Expense. 30 RUBBERMAID Net sales for 2002 were $2,592.4 million, an increase of $26.8 million, or 1.0%, from $2,565.6 million in 2001. The 1.0% sales growth was primarily due to 5.6% sales growth at the Rubbermaid Home Products division, partially offset by an 11.5% sales decline at Graco. The decline at Graco was primarily due to an increase in competitive pressures. The primary reasons for the overall sales increase were sales gains at strategic accounts and new product introductions, such as the Rubbermaid TakeAlongs{R}, the Slim Cooler{TM}, Stain Shield{TM}, and the Tool Tower{TM} and growth in existing products, partially offset by product price reductions. Operating income for 2002 was $214.5 million, an increase of $13.6 million, or 6.8%, from $200.9 million in 2001. The increase is primarily related to productivity improvements and increased margin for new products, partially offset by product price reductions and continued investments in divisional growth initiatives, including costs related to new product development and product launches, primarily television advertising for featured items such as the Slim Cooler{TM} and the Tool Tower{TM}. SHARPIE Net sales for 2002 were $1,908.7 million, an increase of $109.3 million, or 6.1%, from $1,799.4 million in 2001. The 6.1% sales growth was fueled by 20.4% sales growth at Eldon. The primary reasons for the increase were sales gains at strategic accounts, new product introductions (including the Sharpie{R} Chisel Tip and Liquid Paper{R} Backtracker{TM}), and growth in existing Paper Mate{R} pens, Sharpie{R} permanent markers and Colorific{R} product lines. Operating income for 2002 was $323.3 million, an increase of $45.0 million, or 16.2%, from $278.3 million in 2001. The increase is primarily related to productivity improvements and increased margin from new products, partially offset by continued investments in divisional growth initiatives, primarily television advertising for the Sharpie{R} and Paper Mate{R} brands. IRWIN Net sales for 2002 were $1,727.3 million, an increase of $344.7 million, or 24.9%, from $1,382.6 million in 2001. Excluding $318.3 million in sales from the American Tool acquisition, sales increased $26.4 million, or 1.9%. Sales growth was fueled primarily by 14.0% sales growth at the BernzOmatic division offset by a decline of 1.3% at the Levolor/Kirsch division. The American Tool acquisition integration continues on plan. Operating income for 2002 was $136.4 million, an increase of $9.9 million, or 7.8%, from $126.5 million in 2001. Excluding $24.6 million in operating income from the American Tool acquisition, 31 operating income decreased $14.7 million, or 11.6%. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to product price reductions and continued investment in sales and marketing growth initiatives, as well as start up costs related to the American Tool acquisition, partially offset by cost savings from productivity initiatives. CALPHALON HOME Net sales for 2002 were $1,225.5 million, an increase of $63.8 million, or 5.5%, from $1,161.7 million in 2001. Sales growth related primarily to Calphalon and Cookware Europe divisions related to new product introductions and existing product sales at strategic accounts, partially offset by product price reductions. Operating income for 2002 was $119.5 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 0.5%, from $120.1 million in 2001. The slight decrease in operating income was due primarily to product price reductions and costs related to marketing growth initiatives, offset by cost savings from productivity initiatives and new and existing product growth. 2001 VERSUS 2000 Net sales for 2001 were $6,909.3 million, representing a decrease of $25.4 million, or 0.4%, from $6,934.7 million, in 2000. The sales decline was primarily due to shelf space losses at key customers and a significant downturn in the U.S. economy, partially offset by $498.5 million of sales contributions from Paper Mate/Parker (acquired December 2000). Gross income as a percentage of net sales in 2001 was 27.0%, or $1,862.7 million, versus 26.3%, or $1,826.0 million, in 2000. Gross income includes restructuring related and other charges relating to integration costs of recent acquisitions of $7.4 million ($4.7 million after taxes) and $7.9 million ($4.9 million after taxes) in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The gross income improvement is primarily due to the December 29, 2000 acquisition of the Paper Mate/Parker business. Excluding this acquisition, gross income margins were flat. The implementation of the productivity initiative throughout the Company in 2001 maintained gross income margin percentages at 2000 levels despite significant increased fixed costs as production at the Companys manufacturing facilities was slowed in an effort to reduce inventories (net inventories decreased $148.8 million during 2001). Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") in 2001 were 16.9% of net sales, or $1,168.2 million, versus 13.0%, or $899.4 million, in 2000. SG&A includes charges relating to integration costs of recent acquisitions of $12.0 million ($7.7 million after taxes) and $8.8 million ($5.4 million after taxes) in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in SG&A is a result of the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition and planned investments in marketing initiatives, including the 32 Companys Strategic Account Management and Phoenix Programs, supporting the Companys brand portfolio and strategic account strategy. During 2001, the Company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $66.7 million associated with the Companys strategic restructuring plan. The restructuring plan is intended to streamline the Companys supply chain to ensure its position as the best cost global provider throughout the Companys product portfolio. The plan consists of reducing worldwide headcount over the three years beginning in 2001, and includes consolidating duplicate manufacturing facilities. As part of this plan, the Company incurred employee severance and termination benefit costs for approximately 1,700 employees. Additionally, the Company incurred facility exit costs related primarily to the closure of 14 facilities (four at Rubbermaid, one at Sharpie, six at Irwin and three at Calphalon Home). See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a review of these charges. During 2000, the Company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $43.0 million related primarily to the continued Rubbermaid integration and plant closures at Irwin. The Company incurred employee severance and termination benefit costs related to approximately 700 employees terminated in 2000. Such costs included severance and government mandated settlements for facility closures at Rubbermaid Europe, change in control payments made to former Rubbermaid executives, employee terminations at the domestic Rubbermaid divisions and severance at Irwin. The Company incurred merger transaction costs related primarily to legal settlements for Rubbermaids 1998 sale of a former division and other merger related contingencies resolved in 2000. Additionally, the Company incurred facility and other exit costs related primarily to the closure of five European Rubbermaid facilities, three window furnishings facilities as well as the exit of various Rubbermaid product lines. See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a review of these charges. For the year ended December 31, 2001, goodwill amortization as a percentage of net sales was 0.8%, or $56.9 million, versus 0.7%, or $51.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in goodwill amortization is a result of additional goodwill associated with the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition in December 2000. Operating income in 2001 was 8.3% of net sales, or $570.9 million, versus 12.0% of net sales, or $831.7 million, in 2000. Operating income includes restructuring and other charges of $86.1 million ($54.8 million after taxes) and $59.7 million ($36.7 million after taxes) in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in operating margins was primarily due to planned investment in marketing initiatives supporting the Companys brand portfolio and strategic account strategy. 33 Net nonoperating expenses in 2001 were 2.3% of net sales, or $155.0 million, versus 2.1%, or $146.2 million, in 2000. The increased expenses in 2001 are a result of the Companys increased average level of debt, partially offset by lower interest rates. The effective tax rate was 36.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001 versus 38.5% in the prior year. See Footnote 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation of the effective tax rate. Net income for 2001 was $264.6 million compared to net income of $421.6 million in 2000. Basic and diluted earnings per share in 2001 decreased 36.9% to $0.99 from $1.57 in 2000. Net income includes pre tax restructuring and other charges of $86.1 million ($54.8 million after taxes) and $59.7 million ($36.7 million after taxes) in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in net income and earnings per share for 2001 was primarily due to internal sales declines, planned investment in the Companys marketing initiatives and increased restructuring charges to streamline the Companys manufacturing network. BUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS: The Company operates in four general segments: Net Sales by Segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS): 2001 2000 % Change Rubbermaid $2,565.6 $2,809.3 (8.7)% Sharpie 1,799.4 1,423.5 26.4 Irwin 1,382.6 1,455.0 (5.0) Calphalon Home 1,161.7 1,246.9 (6.8) Total Net Sales $6,909.3 $6,934.7 (0.4)% Operating Income by Segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS): 2001 2000 % Change Rubbermaid $200.9 $326.2 (38.4)% Sharpie 278.3 250.4 11.1 Irwin 126.5 207.2 (38.9) Calphalon Home 120.1 172.9 (30.5) Segment Operating Income* $725.8 $956.7 (24.1)% * Segment Operating Income excludes Corporate costs and Restructuring Expense. See Footnote 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the detail of Operating Income by Segment including Corporate and Restructuring Expense. 34 RUBBERMAID Net sales for 2001 were $2,565.6 million, a decrease of $243.7 million, or 8.7%, from $2,809.3 million in 2000. The 8.7% sales decline was primarily due to the Little Tikes and Graco divisions. The primary reasons for the overall sales decline were losses of shelf space at key customers and a significant downturn in the U.S. economy. Operating income for 2001 was $200.9 million, a decrease of $125.3 million, or 38.4%, from $326.2 million in 2000. The decrease resulted primarily from reduced margins caused by the sales declines mentioned above and planned investment in marketing initiatives to support the Companys brand portfolio and Strategic Account Management Program. SHARPIE Net sales for 2001 were $1,799.4 million, an increase of $375.9 million, or 26.4%, from $1,423.5 million in 2000. Excluding $498.5 million in sales from the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition, sales decreased $122.6 million, or 8.6%. The primary reasons for the overall sales decline was softness in the commercial channel and a significant downturn in the U.S. economy. Operating income for 2001 was $278.3 million, an increase of $27.9 million, or 11.1%, from $250.4 million in 2000. The increase resulted primarily from increased sales from the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition offset by reduced margins caused by sales declines in our core business and planned investment in marketing initiatives to support the Companys brand portfolio and Strategic Account Management Program. IRWIN Net sales for 2001 were $1,382.6 million, a decrease of $72.4 million, or 5.0%, from $1,455.0 million in 2000. The 5.0% sales decline was primarily due to the Levolor/Kirsch and Mainland Europe divisions. The primary reasons for the overall sales decline was losses of shelf space at key customers and a significant downturn in the economy. Operating income for 2001 was $126.5 million, a decrease of $80.7 million, or 38.9%, from $207.2 million in 2000. The decrease resulted primarily from reduced margins caused by the sales declines mentioned above, product pricing reductions and planned investment in marketing initiatives to support the Companys brand portfolio and Strategic Account Management Program. 35 CALPHALON HOME Net sales for 2001 were $1,161.7 million, a decrease of $85.2 million, or 6.8%, from $1,246.9 million in 2000. The 6.8% sales decline was primarily due to the Mirro/Calphalon division. The primary reasons for the overall sales decline was losses of shelf space at key customers and a significant downturn in the economy. Operating income for 2001 was $120.1 million, a decrease of $52.8 million, or 30.5%, from $172.9 million in 2000. The decrease resulted primarily from reduced margins caused by the sales declines mentioned above and planned investment in marketing initiatives to support the Companys brand portfolio and Strategic Account Management Program. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SOURCES The Companys primary sources of liquidity and capital resources include cash provided by operations and use of available borrowing facilities. Cash provided by operating activities in 2002 was $868.9 million compared to $865.4 million in 2001 and $623.5 million in 2000. The increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to improved earnings before non cash charges and improved working capital management, principally in the area of accounts payable. In 2002, the Company generated $136.0 million in positive cash flow by better management of accounts payable. As a result, the Company generated free cash flow (defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends) of $392.4 million compared to $391.6 million in 2001 and $81.8 million in 2000. The Company has short term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that are available for short term financing. Borrowings under the Companys uncommitted lines of credit are subject to the discretion of the lender. The Companys lines of credit do not have a material impact on the Companys liquidity. Borrowings under the Companys lines of credit at December 31, 2002 totaled $25.2 million. On March 14, 2002, the Company issued $500.0 million of Senior Notes with five year and ten year maturities. The $500.0 million Senior Notes consist of $250.0 million in 6.00% Senior Notes due 2007 and $250.0 million in 6.75% Senior Notes due 2012. On December 20, 2002, the Company issued $250.0 million of Senior Notes. The seven year Senior Notes were issued at 4.625% and pay interest semi annually on June 15 and December 15 until final maturity on December 15, 2009. The proceeds of these issuances were used to pay down commercial paper. These issuances are reflected in the outstanding amount of medium term notes and the entire amount is considered to be long term debt. 36 The Company completed a $1,300.0 million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility (the "Revolver") on June 14, 2002, replacing the existing $1,300.0 million revolving credit agreement, which was scheduled to terminate in August 2002. The Revolver consists of a $650.0 million 364 day credit agreement and a $650.0 million five year credit agreement. At December 31, 2002, there were no borrowings under the Revolver. In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may issue up to $1,300.0 million of commercial paper. The Revolver provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. At December 31, 2002, $140.0 million (principal amount) of commercial paper was outstanding. Because $650.0 million of the Revolver expires in June 2007, the entire $140.0 million is classified as long term debt. The Revolver permits the Company to borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms. The Revolver requires, among other things, that the Company maintain certain Interest Coverage and Total Indebtedness to Total Capital Ratio, as defined in the agreement. The agreement also limits Subsidiary Indebtedness. As of December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with this agreement. On September 18, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with a financial institution creating a financing entity that is consolidated in the Companys financial statements. Under the agreement, the Company regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity to sell an undivided interest in substantially all of the Companys United States trade receivables to the financing entity. In the quarter ended September 30, 2001, the financing entity issued $450.0 million in preferred debt securities to the financial institution. Those preferred debt securities must be retired or redeemed before the Company can have access to the financing entitys receivables. The receivables and the corresponding $450.0 million preferred debt issued by the subsidiary to the financial institution are recorded in the consolidated accounts of the Company. The proceeds of this debt were used to pay down commercial paper issued by the Company. Because this debt matures in 2008, the entire amount is considered to be long term debt. The provisions of the debt agreement allow the entire outstanding debt to be called upon certain events including the Companys debt rating falling below investment grade and certain levels of accounts receivable write offs. As of December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with the agreement. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the aggregate amount of outstanding receivables sold under the agreement was $738.2 million and $689.3 million, respectively. In August 2002, the Company elected to terminate certain interest rate swap agreements prior to their scheduled maturities and received cash of $25.0 million. Of this amount, $20.8 million represents the fair value of the swaps that were terminated and the remainder represents 37 interest receivable on the swaps. The cash received relating to the fair value of the swaps was included as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The unamortized fair value gain on the terminated interest rate swaps is accounted for as long term debt. As of December 31, 2002, the unamortized gain was $18.4 million, of which $5.3 million is classified as current portion of long term debt. The unamortized gain will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. In August 2002, the Company entered into several new interest rate swap agreements to replace the terminated interest rate swap agreements. These new interest rate swaps convert certain fixed rate debt into floating rate debt based on a notional principal amount of $500.0 million. A $500.0 million universal shelf registration statement became effective in July 2002 under which debt and equity securities may be issued. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $250.0 million in debt securities had been issued under this shelf registration statement. In January 2003, approximately $200.8 million in equity securities were issued pursuant to the shelf registration. See Footnote 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. USES The Companys primary uses of liquidity and capital resources include acquisitions, dividend payments and capital expenditures. Cash used for acquisitions was $242.2 million, $107.5 million and $597.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company continues to invest in businesses and product lines that present a strategic fit with the Companys existing businesses. See Footnote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The Company repaid $901.5 million, $819.0 million and $428.2 million of notes payable and long term debt for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Companys ability to pay down debt was due primarily to current year cash earnings and continued focus on working capital management. Cash used for restructuring activities was $58.0 million, $49.7 million and $32.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Such cash payments primarily represent employee termination benefits and facility exit costs. Capital expenditures were $252.1 million, $249.8 million and $316.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company continues to invest in new product development and productivity. Aggregate dividends paid were $224.4 million, $224.0 million and $225.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 38 Retained earnings decreased $428.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2002. The reduction in retained earnings is due primarily to the $514.9 million, net of tax, non cash goodwill impairment charge taken in 2002 and the payment of $224.4 million in dividends, partially offset by current year earnings. Working capital at December 31, 2002 was $465.6 million compared to $316.8 million at December 31, 2001. The current ratio at December 31, 2002 was 1.18:1 compared to 1.13:1 at December 31, 2001. The increase in working capital and the current ratio is due to the American Tool acquisition, and a reduction in the current portion of long term debt. Total debt to total capitalization (total debt is net of cash and cash equivalents, and total capitalization includes total debt, company obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a subsidiary trust and stockholders equity) was .47:1 at December 31, 2002 compared to .43:1 at December 31, 2001. The increase in total debt to total capitalization is due to the American Tool acquisition, which was funded by the issuance of commercial paper. The Company believes that cash provided by operations and available borrowing facilities will continue to provide adequate support for the cash needs of existing businesses; however, certain events, such as significant acquisitions, could require additional external financing. In January 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of the American Saw & Mfg. Co. ("American Saw"). The purchase price of $450.0 million was funded through the issuance of commercial paper. See Footnote 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statement for further details. MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY The recent dramatic decline in U.S. equity markets has reduced the value of the Companys pension plan assets. As a result, the Companys pension plan, which historically has had an over funded position, currently is under funded. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," the Company recorded an additional minimum pension liability adjustment at December 31, 2002. Based on plan asset values at the measurement date, the approximate effect of this non cash adjustment was to increase the pension liability by $114.5 million, with a corresponding charge to equity, net of taxes, of $71.0 million. The direct charge to stockholders equity did not affect net income, but is included in other comprehensive income. The Company remains confident that its pension plan has the appropriate long term investment strategy and the Companys liquidity position is expected to remain strong. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Footnote 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with 39 generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections describe the Companys critical accounting policies. GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but remain subject to periodic impairment tests in accordance with the statements. The Company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in the third quarter. In addition, the Company tests for impairment periodically if events or circumstances occur subsequent to the Companys annual impairment tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. In conducting this impairment test, the Company estimates the future cash flows of its businesses to which the goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles relate. These cash flows are then discounted at rates ranging from 9% to 13%, reflecting the respective specific industrys cost of capital. The discounted cash flows are then compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit to determine if an impairment exists. If, upon review, the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Reporting units are typically operating segments or operations one level below operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for the reporting units, the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. As a result of this analysis, the Company recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of $538.0 million in the first quarter of 2002 (with an after tax charge totaling $514.9 million). The accounting estimate related to goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make estimates of future cash flows and changes in cost of capital related to each of its business 40 units. There is potential for economic, regulatory, or other conditions that could adversely affect the ability of each business unit to generate future cash flows. Should these conditions deteriorate, there is the potential for additional impairment losses to be incurred, and such losses could be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES As described in Footnote 15 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. These proceedings include claims for damages arising out of use of the Companys products, allegations of infringement of intellectual property, commercial disputes and employment matters as well as environmental matters. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages, and a few proceedings purport to be class actions. In determining the appropriate level of legal reserves, the Company uses outside and internal counsel to evaluate the potential exposure on specific claims. The Company evaluates the range of estimated loss for each specific case and determines the probable exposure based on historical experience and the advice of counsel. While the Company believes it is adequately reserved for legal exposures, management cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these cases, including any amounts it may be required to pay in excess of amounts reserved. The ultimate outcome of these cases could exceed the amounts recorded and such losses could be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is involved in various matters concerning federal and state environmental laws and regulations, including matters in which the Company has been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at contaminated sites under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and equivalent state laws. In assessing its environmental response costs, the Company has considered several factors, including: the extent of the Companys volumetric contribution at each site relative to that of other PRPs; the kind of waste; the terms of existing cost sharing and other applicable agreements; the financial ability of other PRPs to share in the payment of requisite costs; the Companys prior experience with similar sites; environmental studies and cost estimates available to the Company; the effects of inflation on cost estimates; and the extent to which the Companys and other parties status as PRPs is disputed. The Companys estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of December 31, 2002 ranged between $19.4 million and $24.6 million. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had a reserve 41 equal to $22.0 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate. No insurance recovery was taken into account in determining the Companys cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Companys cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to two long term (30 year) operations and maintenance CERCLA matters which are estimated at present value. Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental investigations and response activities, the possibility that the Company could be identified as a PRP at sites identified in the future that require the incurrence of environmental response costs and the possibility of additional sites as a result of businesses acquired, actual costs to be incurred by the Company may vary from the Companys estimates. The ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company and such additional losses may be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. PRODUCT LIABILITY RESERVES The Company has a self insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance. The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant individual files, application of risk transfer programs, and guidance from internal and external legal counsel in determining required product liability reserves. As a result of the most recent analysis, the Company has estimated these reserves at $27.8 million. While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company and such additional losses may be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. RECOVERY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. When aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Companys estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted. INVENTORY RESERVES The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon 42 assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company recognizes revenues and freight billed to customers, net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, volume or trade customer discounts, co op advertising and other sales discounts, upon shipment to customers when all substantial risks of ownership change. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 00 10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs," the Company records amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and all expenses related to shipping and handling as a cost of products sold. See Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Footnote 1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding recent accounting pronouncements. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS The Companys non U.S. business continues to grow at a steady pace. This growth outside the U.S. has been fueled by recent international acquisitions, primarily in Europe. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Companys non U.S. business accounted for approximately 27%, 27% and 25% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Growth of both U.S. and non U.S. businesses is shown below for the years ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS): 2002 vs. 2001 vs. 2001 % 2000 % 2002 2001 2000 Change Change Net sales: U.S. $5,454.2 $5,040.6 $5,191.5 8.2% (2.9)% Non U.S. 1,999.7 1,868.7 1,743.2 7.0 7.2 $7,453.9 $6,909.3 $6,934.7 7.9% (0.4)% MARKET RISK The Companys market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices. Pursuant to the Companys policies, natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse 43 changes in market prices. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Companys primary market risk is interest rate exposure, primarily in the United States. The Company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions, and, for qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense. The Companys foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less. The Company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form: * offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows, * structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk, * converting excess foreign currency deposits into U.S. dollars or the relevant functional currency and * avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency. In addition, the Company utilizes short term forward contracts to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions. Derivative instruments are recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, and any changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income or other comprehensive income. Due to the diversity of its product lines, the Company does not have material sensitivity to any one commodity. The Company manages commodity price exposures primarily through the duration and terms of its vendor contracts. The amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the Company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model. The value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and including substantially all market risk exposures (specifically excluding equity method investments). The fair value losses shown in the table below do not have an impact on current results of operations or financial condition, but are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest rates. The following table 44 indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 (IN MILLIONS): 2002 December 31, 2001 December 31, Confidence Market Risk Average 2002 Average 2001 Level Interest rates $18.2 $20.5 $10.7 $14.5 95% Foreign exchange $0.3 $0.2 $1.2 $0.5 95% The 95% confidence interval signifies the Companys degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the Companys favor. The value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse. Actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is highly unlikely that the Company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. EURO CURRENCY CONVERSION On January 1, 1999, the "Euro" became the common legal currency for 11 of the 15 member countries of the European Union. On that date, the participating countries fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies ("legacy currencies") and the Euro. On January 4, 1999, the Euro began trading on currency exchanges and became available for noncash transactions, if the parties elected to use it. On January 1, 2001, another country (Greece) also adopted the Euro, fixing the conversion rate against their legacy currency. The legacy currencies remained legal tender through December 31, 2001. On January 1, 2002, participating countries introduced Euro denominated bills and coins, and effective July 1, 2002, legacy currencies were no longer legal tender. All businesses in participating countries are now required to conduct all transactions in the Euro and must convert their financial records and reports to be Euro based. The Company has completed this conversion process and has deemed its information systems to be Euro compliant. As a result of the Euro conversion, the Company experienced no adverse impact to its business or financial condition on a consolidated basis.
