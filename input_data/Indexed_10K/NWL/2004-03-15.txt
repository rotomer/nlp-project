ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. It includes the following sections: Executive Overview Consolidated Results of Operations Business Segment Operating Results Liquidity and Capital Resources Minimum Pension Liability Contractual Obligation, Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Critical Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements International Operations Forward Looking Statements Executive Overview Newell Rubbermaid is a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer products and their commercial extensions, serving a wide array of retail channels including department stores, discount stores, warehouse clubs, home centers, hardware stores, commercial distributors, office superstores, contract stationers, automotive stores, and pet superstores. The Company markets a multi product offering of consumer products backed by an obsession with customer service and new product development. The Company conducts businesses in five operating segments as follows: Segment Description of Products Cleaning Organization Indoor/outdoor organization, storage, food storage, cleaning, refuse Office Products Ballpoint/roller ball pens, markers, highlighters, pencils, office products, art supplies Home Fashions Drapery houseware, window treatments, frames Tools Hardware Hand tools, power tool accessories, manual paint applicators, cabinet hardware, propane torches Other Operating segments that do not meet aggregation criteria, including aluminum and stainless steel cookware, glassware, hair care accessory products, infant and juvenile products, including toys, high chairs, car seats, strollers, outdoor play equipment 2003 Overview: In 2003, the Company increased sales by $296.1 million, primarily as a result of its acquisition of American Saw Mfg. Company (Lenox), as discussed more fully below. While the Company saw sales growth in many of its high margin businesses, including Sharpie permanent markers and Irwin hand tools and power tool accessories, the Company experienced significant pricing pressure in some of its low end product lines, primarily low end cookware and picture frames businesses. As a result of these pressures, the Company began to rationalize these product lines, identifying approximately $300 million in annual sales that would not yield the Companys targeted returns. By the end of 2003, the Company exited approximately $50 million in sales of these low margin product lines. This rationalization process will continue in 2004. Gross margin decreased 0.9 points to 26.7% in 2003, primarily related to unfavorable pricing of 1.9%, partially offset by net productivity gains. Gross margin was also adversely affected by increases in raw material costs, particularly in resin, which resulted in approximately $75 million in increased costs in 2003 compared to 2002. Resin prices are expected to increase further in the first quarter of 2004. 22 Table of Contents Cash flow from operations was $773.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $868.9 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities was due primarily to a decrease in earnings before non cash charges of $29.0 million and a net decrease in accrued liabilities and other assets, partially offset by decreases in inventory and accounts receivable which netted to a use of $74.2 million. The Company has decreased inventory as a percentage of sales to 13.8% in 2003 from 16.0% in 2002. The decrease in inventory provided the Company with $179.4 million in operating cash flow in 2003. See sources and uses below for further discussion. Despite the challenges experienced in 2003, the Company continued to make progress in executing its strategy. The following section highlights that progress: Acquisition Integration Effective January 1, 2003, the Company acquired Lenox, a leading manufacturer of power tool accessories and hand tools marketed under the Lenox brand, for approximately $450 million paid for through the issuance of commercial paper, plus transaction costs of $5.8 million. Additionally, the Company completed its integration of American Tool Companies, Inc. (Irwin), which was acquired in April of 2002. The acquisitions of Lenox and Irwin marked a significant expansion and enhancement of the Companys product lines and customer base, launching it squarely into the estimated $10 billion plus global markets for hand tools and power tool accessories. Divestitures The Company consistently reviews its businesses and product offerings and assesses their strategic fit. The Company has identified several businesses that it believes do not fit the Companys long term strategic objectives. The consolidated sales of all these businesses that the Company has determined are non strategic were approximately $875 million in 2003. In 2003, the Company began marketing several of these businesses for potential sale, successfully divesting several businesses in 2003. These businesses included the Cosmolab business, German picture frame business, and some smaller business units. Refer to Footnote 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. In addition, the Company recorded impairment charges for several other businesses where various strategic alternatives were being considered (See Footnote 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In February 2004, the Company finalized the sale of Panex, a Brazilian cookware business and the remainder of its European picture frames business. As a result of these sales, the Company recorded a loss of approximately $78 million in the first quarter of 2004. Refer to Footnote 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on these transactions. On March 14, 2004, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of its U.S. picture frame business (Burnes), its Anchor Hocking glassware business and its Mirro cookware business. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will retain the accounts receivable of the businesses and expects gross proceeds as a result of the transaction to be approximately $310 million. The Burnes picture frames business is included in the Home Fashions business segment. The Anchor Hocking and Mirro businesses are included in the Other business segment. Collectively, these businesses had net sales of approximately $695 million in 2003. The Company expects to record a non cash pre tax loss of approximately $25 million on the sale of these businesses. Closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and certain other customary conditions. Refer to Footnote 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on these transactions. Restructuring In 2003, the Company continued its efforts to streamline its worldwide supply chain to strengthen its position with the goal of becoming the best cost global provider throughout its product range. The three year plan, which began in 2001, consists of reducing worldwide headcount and consolidating duplicate manufacturing and warehouse facilities. Under the Companys restructuring plan, the Company expects to exit 84 facilities and reduce headcount by approximately 12,000 people. At the plans completion, the Company expects total annual savings of between $150 and $175 million ($125 to $135 million related to the reduced headcount, $10 to $15 million related to reduced depreciation, and $15 to $25 million related to other cash savings). In 2003, the Company exited 21 facilities and terminated approximately 6,000 employees and recorded restructuring charges of $245.0 million. To date, the Company has exited 78 facilities and terminated approximately 10,800 employees and recorded approximately $417 million related to its restructuring plans. The Company anticipates recording the final restructuring charges related to the 2001 restructuring plan (expected to be between $43 and $63 million) by the end of the second quarter of 2004. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. 23 Table of Contents Organizational Changes In 2003, the Company made several organizational changes, effectively divided the Company into two major groups, and named two chief operating officers. As of December 31, 2003, the Company realigned its reporting segments to reflect the changes in the Companys structure and to more appropriately reflect the Companys focus on building large consumer brands, promoting organizational integration, achieving operating efficiencies and aligning the businesses with the Companys strategic account management strategy. 2004 Priorities: In 2004, management is focused on the following key objectives: 1. Continue to divest non strategic businesses: The Company expects to complete the majority of its divestitures in 2004. As discussed above, the Company has made significant progress in 2003 by divesting the Cosmolab cosmetics business and the German picture frames business. This progress continued in the first quarter of 2004 by announcing the divestiture of the Panex Brazilian cookware business and the remainder of its European picture frames business. The divestitures of these businesses and others currently being evaluated for potential divestiture are expected to reduce 2004 earnings per share by approximately $0.11 to $0.13, exclusive of the loss to be recognized in 2004. In addition, operating cash flow is expected to be reduced by $40 to $45 million, annually. 2. Complete the 2001 restructuring plan: The Company plans to substantially complete the 2001 restructuring program in 2004 and expects to recognize approximately $43 to $63 million in 2004 charges. 3. Continue to rationalize low margin product lines: The Company will continue to rationalize low margin product lines in 2004. The completion of this program is expected to reduce annual sales by approximately $300 million. 4. Deploy Newell Operational Excellence: The Company is committed to reducing the costs by at least 5% annually. In connection with this goal, the Company is committed to deploying and implementing NWL OPEX, which is a methodical process focused on lean manufacturing. It includes installing the right manufacturing and distribution metrics and driving improvement quarter after quarter. In addition to cost reduction, other key components of NWL OPEX are improved quality and service levels and the reduction of inventory and lead times. Consolidated Results of Operations The following table sets forth for the periods indicated items from the Consolidated Statements of Operations as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, ($ in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Net sales $ 7,750.0 100.0 % $ 7,453.9 100.0 % $ 6,909.3 100.0 % Cost of products sold 5,682.8 73.3 5,394.2 72.4 5,046.6 73.0 Gross margin 2,067.2 26.7 2,059.7 27.6 1,862.7 27.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,352.9 17.5 1,307.3 17.5 1,168.2 16.9 Impairment charge 289.4 3.7 Restructuring costs 245.0 3.2 122.7 1.6 66.7 1.0 Goodwill amortization 56.9 0.8 Operating income 179.9 2.3 629.7 8.4 570.9 8.3 Nonoperating expenses: Interest expense 140.1 1.8 137.3 1.8 137.5 2.0 Other, net 19.7 0.3 23.9 0.3 17.5 0.3 Net nonoperating expenses 159.8 2.1 161.2 2.2 155.0 2.2 24 Table of Contents Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 20.1 0.3 468.5 6.3 415.9 6.0 Income taxes 66.7 0.9 157.0 2.1 151.3 2.2 (Loss)/income before cumulative effect of accounting change (46.6 ) (0.6 ) 311.5 4.2 264.6 3.8 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax (514.9 ) (6.9 ) Net (loss)/income $ (46.6 ) (0.6 )% $ (203.4 ) (2.7 )% $ 264.6 3.8 % Results of Operations 2003 vs. 2002 Net sales increased $296.1 million, or 4.0%, in 2003. The increase in sales is primarily related to sales from recently acquired businesses of approximately $339.2 million, partially offset by a decrease of $39.9 million in sales from divested businesses, and favorable foreign currency of $231.1 million, partially offset by negative pricing of $140.8 million and the exit of high risk accounts of $165.3 million. Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, in 2003 was 26.7%, or $2,067.2 million, versus 27.6%, or $2,059.7 million in 2002. The reduction in gross margin is primarily related to unfavorable pricing of 1.9%, or 1.3 points, offset by net productivity of 1.6%. Increased resin costs of $75 million negatively impacted gross margins and are included as a reduction of our productivity. The favorable impact of the Lenox acquisition (0.7 points) was more than offset by unfavorable mix in the remainder of our businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) were 17.5% of net sales in both 2003 and 2002. The $45.6 million increase in SGA primarily related to recently acquired businesses of approximately $84.8 million. All other SGA was down by $39.2 million with streamlining initiatives of $128 million more than offsetting increases from currency translation, pension and strategic investments. The Company continues to assess opportunities to divest or exit non strategic businesses and low margin product lines. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $289.4 million associated with these businesses and the exit of certain product lines. Refer to Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2003, the Company recorded pre tax strategic restructuring charges of $245.0 million ($165.7 million after taxes) and $122.7 million ($81.6 million after tax) in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2003 pre tax charge included $118.5 million of facility and other exit costs, $103.3 million of employee severance and termination benefits, and $23.2 million in other restructuring costs. The 2002 pre tax charge included $36.6 million of facility and other exit costs, $76.3 million of employee severance and termination benefits, and $9.8 million in other restructuring costs. Refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the strategic restructuring plan. Operating income in 2003 was 2.3% of net sales, or $179.9 million, versus operating income of 8.4%, or $629.7 million in 2002. The decrease in operating margins is primarily the result of increased restructuring charges incurred to streamline the Companys supply chain and the impairment charge related to businesses for which the Company has begun to explore strategic alternatives, including potential divestiture. Net income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting change in 2003 was $20.1 million, a $448.4 million decrease from $468.5 million in 2002. The decrease relates primarily to the increased restructuring costs and the impairment charge noted above. The effective tax rate was 331.9% for the year ended 2003 versus 33.5% in the prior year. The increase in the effective tax rate primarily related to the non deductibility of the write off of goodwill associated with the Companys $289.4 million impairment charge. Refer to Notes 13 and 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 25 Table of Contents Net loss before cumulative effect of accounting change in 2003 was $46.6 million, a $358.1 million decrease from net income before cumulative effect of accounting change of $311.5 million in 2002. Diluted loss per share before cumulative effect of accounting change was $0.17 in 2003 compared to earnings of $1.16 in 2002. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company completed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, which resulted in an impairment charge of $514.9 million, net of tax. See Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Net loss for 2003 was $46.6 million compared to a net loss of $203.4 million in 2002. Basic and diluted loss per share in 2003 decreased to a loss of $0.17 versus a loss of $0.76 in 2002. The decrease in net loss and loss per share was primarily due to the lack of any cumulative effect of accounting changes related to goodwill, offset by additional restructuring charges to streamline the Companys supply chain, and the impairment charges related to non strategic businesses that the Company is considering for possible divestiture. See Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to cumulative effect of accounting change charge for goodwill. Results of Operations 2002 vs. 2001 Net sales increased $544.6 million, or 7.9%, in 2002. The increase in sales is primarily related to sales from Irwin of $318.3 million (acquired April 2002) and increased sales of core products of 3.3%. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales in 2002 was 27.6%, or $2,059.7 million, versus 27.0%, or $1,862.7 million, in 2001. The improvement in gross margin was primarily related to the implementation of a productivity initiative throughout the Company and higher margins from our new products. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 were 17.5% of net sales, or $1,307.3 million, versus 16.9%, or $1,168.2 million, in 2001. The increase in SGA is a result of the Irwin acquisition ($75.5 million) and planned investments in marketing initiatives, including the Companys Strategic Account Management Program, television advertising program and Phoenix Program, supporting the Companys brand portfolio and strategic account management strategy. During 2002, the Company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $122.7 million associated with the Companys strategic restructuring plan. The 2002 pre tax charge included $36.6 million of facility and other exit costs, $76.3 million of employee severance and termination benefits, and $9.8 million in other restructuring costs. The 2001 pre tax charge included $34.6 million of facility and other exit costs, $28.5 million of employee severance and termination benefits, and $3.6 million in other restructuring costs. Refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the strategic restructuring plan. Operating income in 2002 was 8.4% of net sales, or $629.7 million, versus 8.3% of net sales, or $570.9 million, in 2001. The increase in operating margins was primarily due to improvement in gross margin and the elimination of amortization expense associated with goodwill (see Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion) offset by planned investment in marketing initiatives supporting the Companys brand portfolio and strategic account management strategy and restructuring charges to streamline the Companys supply chain. Net nonoperating expenses in 2002 were 2.2% of net sales, or $161.2 million, versus 2.2%, or $155.0 million, in 2001. The increase in net nonoperating expense primarily related to the Anchor Hocking withdrawn divestiture cost of $13.6 million ($9.1 million after tax) in 2002. These costs were partially offset by lower interest rates. See Footnote 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The effective tax rate was 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus 36.4% in the prior year. The decrease in the tax rate primarily related to the change in accounting relating to goodwill and tradename amortization. See Footnotes 1 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation of accounting change related to the effective tax rate. 26 Table of Contents Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change in 2002 was $311.5 million, a $46.9 million, or 17.7% increase from $264.6 million in 2001. Diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of accounting change was $1.16 in 2002 compared to $0.99 in 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company completed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, which resulted in an impairment charge of $514.9 million, net of tax. See Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Net loss for 2002 was $203.4 million compared to net income of $264.6 million in 2001. Basic and diluted loss/earnings per share in 2002 decreased to a loss of $0.76 versus income of $0.99 in 2001. The decrease in net income and earnings per share in 2002 was primarily due to the cumulative effect of accounting changes related to goodwill, and increased restructuring charges to streamline the Companys supply chain, partially offset by an improvement in gross margins, the elimination of amortization expense associated with goodwill, lower interest rates and a reduction in income tax expense. See Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to cumulative effect of accounting change charge for goodwill. Business Segment Operating Results 2003 vs. 2002 Business Segment Operating Results The Company operates in five general segments: Net Sales by Segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions): 2003 2002 % Change Cleaning and Organization $ 2,013.7 $ 1,901.8 5.9 % Office Products 1,681.2 1,684.1 (0.2 ) Home Fashions 1,258.7 1,425.5 (11.7 ) Tools and Hardware 1,199.7 783.0 53.2 Other 1,596.7 1,659.5 (3.8 ) Total Net Sales $ 7,750.0 $ 7,453.9 4.0 % Operating Income by Segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions): 2003 2002 % Change Cleaning and Organization $ 92.0 $ 169.0 (45.6 )% Office Products 309.6 306.1 1.1 Home Fashions 54.9 113.5 (51.6 ) Tools and Hardware 179.2 79.2 126.3 Other 108.9 115.7 (5.9 ) Corporate (30.3 ) (31.1 ) Impairment charge (289.4 ) Restructuring costs (245.0 ) (122.7 ) Total Operating Income $ 179.9 $ 629.7 Cleaning and Organization Net sales for 2003 were $2,013.7 million, an increase of $111.9 million, or 5.9%, from $1,901.8 million in 2002. The 5.9% sales growth was primarily due to mid single digit sales growth at the Rubbermaid Home Products division. The primary reason for the overall sales increase was continued growth in sales of newer products such 27 Table of Contents as the Rubbermaid TakeAlongs, the Tool Tower, the Sports Station, the Endurance Cooler and other product offerings, partially offset by price reductions. Operating income for 2002 was $92.0 million, a decrease of $77.0 million, or 45.6%, from $169.0 million in 2002. The decrease in operating income is primarily the result of higher raw material costs (primarily resin) and pricing pressure on non differentiated items in its Rubbermaid Home Products business. Office Products Net sales for 2003 were $1,681.2 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 0.2%, from $1,684.1 million in 2002. The slight decrease in net sales primarily resulted from continued softness in the commercial sector. Operating income for 2003 was $309.6 million, an increase of $3.5 million, or 1.1%, from $306.1 million in 2002. Operating income was positively impacted by productivity and favorable mix management, partially offset by increased investments in marketing initiatives. Home Fashions Net sales for 2003 were $1,258.7 million, a decrease of $166.8 million, or 11.7%, from $1,425.5 million in 2002. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to a double digit decrease at the Burnes picture frames business, which primarily resulted from the Companys planned exit from certain high risk customers and pricing pressure on opening price point products. The planned exit of low margin product lines in the Levolor/Kirsch business also contributed to the decrease in sales. Operating income for 2003 was $54.9 million, a decrease of $58.6 million, or 51.6%, from $113.5 million in 2002. The decrease in operating income is primarily due to the sales decline noted previously and pricing pressure on opening price point items. Tools and Hardware Net sales for 2003 were $1,199.7 million, an increase of $416.7 million, or 53.2%, from $783.0 million in 2002. The increase in net sales is primarily due to incremental sales resulting from the Lenox and Irwin acquisitions, as well as strong sales in the Irwin North America division driven by new products, most notably the success of the Strait Line products. Operating income for 2002 was $179.2 million, an increase of $100.0 million, or 126.3%, from $79.2 million in 2002. The improvement in operating income was driven by strong productivity, new products and the acquisitions of Lenox and Irwin. Other Net sales for 2003 were $1,596.7 million, a decrease of $62.8 million, or 3.8%, from $1,659.5 million in 2002. The decrease in sales resulted primarily from the disposition of Cosmolab in March 2003 as well as a mid single digit decrease in net sales in the low end cookware business, primarily as a result of negative pricing and unfavorable mix. Operating income for 2002 was $108.9 million, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 5.9%, from $115.7 million in 2002. The main driver of this decrease in operating income was the decrease in sales caused by pricing pressures and unfavorable mix in the low end cookware business. 2002 vs. 2001 Business Segment Operating Results Net Sales by Segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions): 28 Table of Contents 2002 2001 % Change Cleaning and Organization $ 1,901.8 $ 1,819.1 4.5 % Office Products 1,684.1 1,608.8 4.7 Home Fashions 1,425.5 1,435.2 (0.7 ) Tools and Hardware 783.0 432.6 81.0 Other 1,659.5 1,613.6 2.8 Total Net Sales $ 7,453.9 $ 6,909.3 7.9 % Operating Income by Segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions): 2002 2001 % Change Cleaning and Organization $ 169.0 $ 159.8 5.8 % Office Products 306.1 268.7 13.9 Home Fashions 113.5 120.3 (5.7 ) Tools and Hardware 79.2 67.7 17.0 Other 115.7 105.5 9.7 Corporate (31.1 ) (84.4 ) Restructuring costs (122.7 ) (66.7 ) Total Operating Income $ 629.7 $ 570.9 Cleaning and Organization Net sales for 2002 were $1,901.8 million, an increase of $82.7 million, or 4.5%, from $1,819.1 million in 2001. The 4.5% sales growth was primarily due to mid single digit sales growth at the Rubbermaid Home Products division. The primary reasons for the overall sales increase were sales gains at strategic accounts and new product introductions, such as the Rubbermaid TakeAlongs, the Slim Cooler, Stain Shield, and the Tool Tower and growth in existing products, partially offset by product price reductions. Operating income for 2002 was $169.0 million, an increase of $9.2 million, or 5.8%, from $159.8 million in 2001. The increase is primarily related to productivity improvements and increased margin for new products, partially offset by product price reductions and continued investments in divisional growth initiatives, including costs related to new product development and product launches, primarily television advertising for featured items such as the Slim Cooler and the Tool Tower. Office Products Net sales for 2002 were $1,684.1 million, an increase of $75.3 million, or 4.7%, from $1,608.8 million in 2001. The primary reasons for the increase were sales gains at strategic accounts, new product introductions (including the Sharpie Chisel Tip and Liquid Paper Backtracker), and growth in existing Paper Mate pens, Sharpie permanent markers and Colorific product lines. Operating income for 2002 was $306.1 million, an increase of $37.4 million, or 13.9%, from $268.7 million in 2001. The increase is primarily related to sales growth, productivity improvements and increased margin from new products, partially offset by continued investments in divisional growth initiatives, primarily television advertising for the Sharpie and Paper Mate brands. Home Fashions Net sales for 2002 were $1,425.5 million, a decrease of $9.7 million, or 0.7%, from $1,435.2 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily driven by a low single digit decrease in net sales of the Levolor/Kirsch division caused by the planned exit of low margin products. 29 Table of Contents Operating income for 2002 was $113.5 million, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 5.7%, from $120.3 million in 2001. The primary driver in the decrease in operating income was the decrease in net sales at the Levolor/Kirsch division caused by the planned exit of low margin products. Tools and Hardware Net sales for 2002 were $783.0 million, an increase of $350.4 million, or 81.0%, from $432.6 million in 2001. The increase in sales is primarily related to sales from Irwin of $318.3 million and double digit sales growth at the BernzOmatic division. Operating income for 2002 was $79.2 million, an increase of $11.5 million, or 17.0%, from $67.7 million in 2001. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased sales and cost savings from productivity initiatives, partially offset by product price reductions, continued investment in sales and marketing growth initiatives, and start up costs related to the Irwin acquisition. Other Net sales for 2002 were $1,659.5 million, an increase of $45.9 million, or 2.8%, from $1,613.6 million in 2001. Sales growth related primarily to Calphalon and Cookware Europe divisions related to new product introductions and existing product sales at strategic accounts, partially offset by a double digit sales decline at Graco. Operating income for 2002 was $115.7 million, an increase of $10.2 million, or 9.7%, from $105.5 million in 2001. The increase in operating income was due primarily to cost savings from productivity initiatives and sales growth from new and existing products, partially offset by product price reductions and costs related to marketing growth initiatives. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents increased by $89.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows as of the year ended December 31 (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Cash provided by operating activities $ 773.2 $ 868.9 $ 865.4 Cash used in investing activities (716.1 ) (486.5 ) (303.6 ) Cash provided by/(used in) financing activities 31.4 (334.9 ) (575.9 ) Exchange effect on cash and cash equivalents 0.8 0.8 (1.6 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 89.3 $ 48.3 $ (15.7 ) Sources The Companys primary sources of liquidity and capital resources include cash provided by operations and use of available borrowing facilities. Cash provided from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $773.2 million compared to $868.9 million for the comparable period of 2002. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities was due to a decrease in earnings before non cash charges of $29.0 million (as shown in the following table) and a reduction in the year over year improvement in working capital and other assets in 2003 vs. 2002, which used an additional $74.2 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred gains relating to the early termination of certain interest rate swap arrangements. The deferred gain from these swap agreements was $28.3 million in 2003 compared to $20.8 million in 2002 and were included in Other in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The following table reconciles earnings before non cash charges to net loss as of December 31, ($ in millions): 2003 2002 Change Net loss $ (46.6 ) $ (203.4 ) Depreciation and amortization 278.2 280.7 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 514.9 Non cash restructuring charges 138.3 74.9 Deferred income taxes (11.5 ) 48.3 Loss on sale of businesses 289.4 Non cash impairment charges 29.7 Other, excluding swap termination (2.1 ) (11.0 ) Earnings before non cash charges $675.4 $704.4 $ (29.0 ) In 2003, the Company completed the sale of its Cosmolab cosmetic and the German picture frames businesses. The Company received cash proceeds of $10.2 million related to these transactions. The Company used the proceeds from the sale to reduce its commercial paper borrowings. Cosmolab was included in the results of the Companys Other segment and the German Frames business was included in the Home Fashions segment. 30 Table of Contents In 2003, the Company generated $33.7 million of cash related to the sale of idle assets, a $25.9 million increase over 2002. The Company does not anticipate significant cash flow from the sale of idle assets in 2004. In 2003, the Company received proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,044.0 million compared to $772.0 million in 2002. On January 10, 2003, the Company completed the sale of 6.67 million shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $30.10 per share pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Total proceeds from the sale were approximately $200.8 million, resulting in net proceeds to the Company, after expenses, of $200.1 million. The proceeds were used to reduce the Companys commercial paper borrowings. The Company has a $1.05 billion universal shelf registration statement that became effective in April 2003 under which debt and equity securities may be issued. In 2003, $400.0 million of medium term notes were issued under this shelf registration statement, the proceeds of which were used to pay down commercial paper. The Company has short term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that are available for short term financing. Borrowings under the Companys uncommitted lines of credit are subject to the discretion of the lender. The Companys lines of credit do not have a material impact on the Companys liquidity. Borrowings under the Companys lines of credit at December 31, 2003 totaled $21.9 million. The Company completed a $1,300.0 million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility (the Revolver) on June 14, 2002. The Revolver consists of a $650.0 million 364 day credit agreement and a $650.0 million five year credit agreement. On June 13, 2003, the Company rolled over the 364 day credit agreement. At December 31, 2003, there were no borrowings under the Revolver. In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may issue up to $1,300.0 million of commercial paper. The Revolver provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. At December 31, 2003, $217.1 million (principal amount) of commercial paper was outstanding. Because $650.0 million of the Revolver expires in June 2007, the entire $217.1 million is classified as long term debt. The Revolver permits the Company to borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms. The Revolver requires, among other things, that the Company maintain certain Interest Coverage and Total Indebtedness to Total Capital Ratio, as defined in the agreement. The agreement also limits Subsidiary Indebtedness. As of December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with this agreement. Under a 2001 receivables facility with a financial institution, the Company created a financing entity that is consolidated in the Companys financial statements. Under this facility, the Company regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity to sell an undivided interest in substantially all of the Companys United States trade receivables to the financing entity. In 2001, the financing entity issued $450.0 million in preferred debt securities to the financial institution. Those preferred debt securities must be retired or redeemed before the Company can have access to the financing entitys receivables. Also, certain levels of accounts receivable write offs and other events would permit the financial institution to terminate the receivables lending commitment and require redemption of the preferred debt securities. The receivables and the $450.0 million preferred debt securities are recorded in the consolidated accounts of the Company. Because this debt matures in 2008, the entire amount is considered to be long term debt. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the aggregate amount of outstanding receivables sold under the agreement was $777.4 million and $738.2 million, respectively. Uses The Companys primary uses of liquidity and capital resources include acquisitions, payments on long term debt, dividend payments and capital expenditures. Cash used for acquisitions was $460.0 million in 2003, compared to $242.2 million in 2002. The increase in cash used for acquisitions related primarily to the acquisition of Lenox, which was funded through the issuance of commercial paper. 31 Table of Contents Capital expenditures were $300.0 million and $252.1 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to the acquisitions of Irwin and Lenox and the Companys increased investment in new product development and productivity initiatives. In 2003, the Company made payments on long term debt of $989.6 million compared to $901.5 million in 2002. Aggregate dividends paid were $230.9 million and $224.4 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase primarily relates to the additional shares issued on January 10, 2003. Cash used for restructuring activities was $106.4 million and $58.0 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The cash payments primarily relate to employee termination benefits. Working capital at December 31, 2003 was $978.2 million compared to $465.6 million at December 31, 2002. The current ratio at December 31, 2003 was 1.48:1 compared to 1.18:1 at December 31, 2002. The increase in working capital and the current ratio is due to the Irwin and Lenox acquisitions, and a reduction in the current portion of long term debt. Total debt to total capitalization (total debt is net of cash and cash equivalents, and total capitalization includes total debt and stockholders equity) was .58:1 at December 31, 2003 and .57:1 at December 31, 2002. The Company believes that cash provided from operations and available borrowing facilities will continue to provide adequate support for the cash needs of existing businesses on a short term basis; however, certain events, such as significant acquisitions, could require additional external financing on a long term basis. Minimum Pension Liability The decline in U.S. and European interest rates since the prior measurement date has caused the Company to change the discount rate used to calculate the present value of its pension liabilities from 6.48% at December 31, 2002 to an estimated 6.14% at December 31, 2003, increasing the Companys pension plan liability. As a result, the Companys pension plan, which historically has had an over funded position, currently is under funded. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded an additional minimum pension liability adjustment at December 31, 2003. Based on plan asset values at the measurement date, the approximate effect of this non cash adjustment was to increase the pension liability by $170.0 million, with a corresponding charge to equity, net of taxes, of $114.5 million. The direct charge to stockholders equity did not affect net income, but is included in other comprehensive income. The Company remains confident that its pension plan has the appropriate long term investment strategy and the Companys liquidity position is expected to remain strong. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has various contractual obligations which are appropriately recorded as liabilities in its consolidated financial statements. Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of December 31, 2003 and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements. The following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations listed below are expected to have on the Companys cash flow in the indicated period. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2003. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the footnotes to the financial statements, as referenced in the table (in millions): 32 Table of Contents Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt maturities(1) $ 2,882.1 $ 13.5 $ 347.3 $ 921.5 $ 1,599.8 Interest on long term debt(2) 1,576.8 126.9 247.5 193.2 1,009.2 Operating lease obligations(3) 393.0 111.4 143.8 76.1 61.7 Purchase obligations(4) 195.0 193.4 0.6 0.5 0.5 Total contractual obligation(5) $ 5,046.9 $ 445.2 $ 739.2 $ 1,191.3 $ 2,671.2 (1) Amounts represent contractual obligations due, excluding interest, based on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2003.

(5) Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2003 balance sheet as current liabilities. The Company also has obligations with respect to its pension and post retirement medical benefit plans. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had $131.0 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Companys self insurance programs, including workers compensation, product liability, and medical. Refer to Note 17 in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2003, the Company did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Critical Accounting Policies The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Footnote 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections describe the Companys critical accounting policies. Goodwill and Other Indefinite Life Intangible Assets Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but remain subject to periodic impairment tests in accordance with the statements. The Company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in the third quarter. The Company also tests for impairment if events or circumstances occur subsequent to the Companys annual impairment tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the Companys customer base, or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers. In conducting this impairment test, the Company estimates the future cash flows of its businesses to which the goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles relate. These cash flows are then discounted at rates ranging from 9% to 13%, reflecting the respective specific industrys cost of capital. The discounted cash flows are then compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. If, upon review, the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Reporting units are 33 Table of Contents typically operating segments or operations one level below operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for the reporting units, the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. As a result of this analysis, the Company recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of $538.0 million in the first quarter of 2002 (with an after tax charge totaling $514.9 million). In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company began exploring various options for certain businesses in the Home Fashions and Other segments, including evaluating those businesses for potential sale. As this process progressed, the Company obtained a better indication of the market value of these businesses and determined that the businesses had a net book value in excess of their fair value. As a result, the Company conducted a new impairment test in the fourth quarter and recorded an impairment loss of $242.0 million related to goodwill to write the net assets of these businesses to fair value. The accounting estimate related to goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make estimates of future cash flows and changes in cost of capital related to each of its business units. There is potential for economic, regulatory, or other conditions that could adversely affect the ability of each business unit to generate future cash flows. Should these conditions deteriorate, there is the potential for additional impairment losses to be incurred, and such losses could be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Environmental Reserves As described in Footnote 17 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. These proceedings include claims for damages arising out of use of the Companys products, allegations of infringement of intellectual property, commercial disputes and employment matters as well as environmental matters. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages, and a few proceedings purport to be class actions. In determining the appropriate level of legal reserves, the Company evaluates the potential exposure on specific claims. The Company evaluates the range of estimated loss for each specific case and determines the probable exposure based largely on historical experience. While the Company believes it is adequately reserved for legal exposures, management cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these cases, including any amounts it may be required to pay in excess of amounts reserved. The ultimate outcome of these cases could exceed the amounts recorded and such losses could be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is involved in various matters concerning federal and state environmental laws and regulations, including matters in which the Company has been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at contaminated sites under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and equivalent state laws. In assessing its environmental response costs, the Company has considered several factors, including: the extent of the Companys volumetric contribution at each site relative to that of other PRPs; the kind of waste; the terms of existing cost sharing and other applicable agreements; the financial ability of other PRPs to share in the payment of requisite costs; the Companys prior experience with similar sites; environmental studies and cost estimates available to the Company; the effects of inflation on cost estimates; and the extent to which the Companys and other parties status as PRPs is disputed. The Companys estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of December 31, 2003 ranged between $14.5 million and $19.9 million. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had a reserve equal to $17.8 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate. No insurance recovery was taken into 34 Table of Contents account in determining the Companys cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Companys cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to two long term (30 year) operations and maintenance CERCLA matters which are estimated at present value. Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental investigations and response activities, the possibility that the Company could be identified as a PRP at sites identified in the future that require the incurrence of environmental response costs and the possibility of additional sites as a result of businesses acquired, actual costs to be incurred by the Company may vary from the Companys estimates. The ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company and such additional losses may be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Product Liability Reserves The Company has a self insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance. The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves. As a result of the most recent analysis, the Company has estimated these reserves at $27.9 million. The Companys actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the Companys product liability reserve. While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company and such additional losses may be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Recovery of Accounts Receivable The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. When aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Companys estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted. Inventory Reserves The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenues and freight billed to customers, net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, volume or trade customer discounts, co op advertising and other sales discounts, upon shipment to customers when all substantial risks of ownership change. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 00 10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, the Company records amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and all expenses related to shipping and handling as a cost of products sold. See Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Footnote 1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding recent accounting pronouncements. 35 Table of Contents International Operations The Companys non U.S. business increased 12.3% in 2003 and 7.0% in 2002. In 2003, the increase primarily related to foreign currency movement, primarily in Europe. In 2002, the increase was fueled by recent international acquisitions, primarily in Europe. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Companys non U.S. business accounted for approximately 29%, 27% and 27% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Growth of both U.S. and non U.S. businesses is shown below for the years ended December 31, (in millions): 2003 vs. 2002 vs. 2002% 2001% 2003 2002 2001 Change Change Net sales: U.S. $ 5,504.9 $ 5,454.2 $ 5,040.6 0.9 % 8.2 % Non U.S. 2,245.1 1,999.7 1,868.7 12.3 7.0 $ 7,750.0 $ 7,453.9 $ 6,909.3 4.0 % 7.9 % Forward Looking Statements Forward looking statements in this Report are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward looking statements may relate to, but are not limited to, information or assumptions about sales, income/(loss), earnings per share, return on equity, return on invested capital, capital expenditures, working capital, cash flow, dividends, capital structure, debt to capitalization ratios, interest rates, internal growth rates, restructuring charges, impact of changes in accounting standards, pending legal proceedings and claims (including environmental matters), future economic performance, operating income improvements, costs and cost savings, synergies, managements plans, goals and objectives for future operations and growth or the assumptions relating to any of the forward looking statements.

Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those matters set forth in this Report and Exhibit 99.1 to this Report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The Companys market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices. Pursuant to the Companys policies, natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Companys primary market risks are foreign exchange and interest rate exposure. The Company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions, and, for qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense. The Companys foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less. The Company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form: offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows, structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk, converting excess foreign currency deposits into U.S. dollars or the relevant functional currency and avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency. 36 Table of Contents In addition, the Company utilizes short term forward contracts to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions. Derivatives used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company purchases certain raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors. While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, a variety of programs, including periodic raw material purchases, purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the Company address this risk. Generally, the Company does not use derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. The amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the Company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model. The value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and including substantially all market risk exposures (specifically excluding equity method investments). The fair value losses shown in the table below do not have an impact on current results of operations or financial condition, but are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest rates. The following table indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 (in millions): 2003 December 31, 2002 December 31, Confidence Market Risk Average 2003 Average 2002 Level Interest rates $ 20.0 $ 12.8 $ 18.2 $ 20.5 95 % Foreign exchange $ 1.3 $ 1.5 $ 0.3 $ 0.2 95 % The 95% confidence interval signifies the Companys degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the Companys favor. The value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse. Actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is highly unlikely that the Company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets.
