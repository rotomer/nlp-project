ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. It includes the following sections: Executive Overview Consolidated Results of Operations Business Segment Operating Results Liquidity and Capital Resources Pension Liability Resolution of Income Tax Contingency Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Critical Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements International Operations Forward Looking Statements 16 Executive Overview Newell Rubbermaid is a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer products and their commercial extensions, serving a wide array of retail channels including department stores, discount stores, warehouse clubs, home centers, hardware stores, commercial distributors, office superstores, contract stationers, automotive stores, and pet superstores. The Company markets a multi product offering of consumer products backed by an obsession with customer service and new product development. The Company conducts businesses in five operating segments as follows: Segment Description of Products Cleaning Organization Indoor/outdoor organization, storage, food storage, cleaning, refuse Office Products Ballpoint/roller ball pens, markers, highlighters, pencils, office products, art supplies Tools Hardware Hand tools, power tool accessories, industrial tool accessories, manual paintapplicators, cabinet and window hardware, propane torches Home Fashions Drapery houseware, window treatments Other Operating segments that do not meet aggregation criteria, including aluminum andstainless steel cookware, glassware, hair care accessory products, infant and juvenileproducts, including toys, high chairs, car seats, strollers 2004 Overview: In 2004, management was focused on the following key objectives: 1. Continue to divest non strategic businesses. 2. Complete the 2001 restructuring plan. 3. Continue to rationalize low margin product lines. 4. Deploy Newell Operational Excellence (Newell OPEX). The following section details the Companys performance in each of its 2004 objectives: Divestiture of Nonstrategic Businesses In 2004, the Company completed its previously announced divestiture program, divesting several nonstrategic businesses as follows: On January 31, 2004, the Company completed the sale of its Panex Brazilian low end cookware division (previously reported in the Other operating segment) and European picture frames businesses (previously reported in the Home Fashions operating segment). On April 13, 2004, the Company sold substantially all of its U.S. picture frame business (Burnes), its Anchor Hocking glassware business and its Mirro cookware business. Under the terms of the agreement and final adjustments relating to the transaction, the Company retained the accounts receivable of the businesses of $76.6 million, and total proceeds, including the retained receivables, as a result of the transaction were $304 million. The Burnes picture frame business was previously reported in the Home Fashions operating segment, while the Anchor Hocking and Mirro businesses were previously reported in the Other operating segment. On July 1, 2004, the Company completed the sale of Little Tikes Commercial Playground Systems Inc. (LTCPS) business. LTCPS was previously reported in the Other operating segment, as a unit of the Companys Little Tikes division. The Company retained the consumer portion of its Little Tikes division. The results of the businesses above are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Footnote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. On January 12, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement for the intended sale of the Companys Curver business. The Curver business manufactures and markets plastic products for home storage and garage organization, food storage, laundry, bath, cleaning, closet organization and refuse removal in various countries in Europe. The Companys European commercial products and other European businesses will not be affected by the intended sale. In connection with this intended transaction, the Company expects to record a total non cash loss related to the sale 17 of approximately $75 to $95 million in the first and second quarters of 2005. The Curver business had 2004 sales of approximately $150 million. The Curver business is included in the Cleaning Organization segment, but will be reclassified to discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2005. See Footnote 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring In 2004, the Company completed the accounting charges associated with its strategic restructuring plan (the Plan) announced on May 3, 2001. The specific objectives of the Plan were to streamline the Companys supply chain to become the best cost global provider throughout the Companys portfolio by reducing worldwide headcount and consolidating duplicative manufacturing facilities. The Company recorded $461.7 million in restructuring charges under the Plan, including $84.2 million on discontinued operations. In addition to the restructuring activities outlined under the Plan, the Company recorded a fourth quarter charge of $4.2 million, primarily related to the closure of one additional facility in the Other segment not contemplated under the Plan. See Footnote 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Rationalization of Low Margin Product Lines In 2004, the Company exited approximately $275 million of low margin product lines, principally in the Rubbermaid Home Products, Eldon Office Products and Swish UK businesses. The Company continuously reviews its entire product line portfolio and evaluates their long term strategic fit within the overall corporate strategy. The Company considers factors such as raw material inflation and pricing elasticity in its review of these product lines. Product line rationalization is expected to continue in 2005 with further exits planned in Rubbermaid Home Products, Graco, Swish UK and Office Products businesses. Refer to the Companys 2005 priorities, listed below, for additional information. Newell OPEX / Productivity The Companys 2004 productivity initiatives, driven by the deployment of Newell OPEX, generated gross productivity of $123 million for the year and offset raw material inflation of $116 million. Significant opportunity remains for the Company in 2005, especially in the Office Products segment. The continued focus on implementing Newell OPEX should allow the Company to deliver productivity savings, thereby delivering long term gross margin expansion, despite raw material inflation. In addition, the Company has placed further emphasis on capital spending discipline, specifically in the Companys Rubbermaid Home Products business. Overall capital expenditures decreased to $121.9 million in 2004, from $300 million and $252.1 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. 2005 Priorities: In 2005, management is focused on the following key objectives: 1. Strengthen/Broaden Portfolio: The Company regularly evaluates its current portfolio and assesses whether strategic partnerships and or acquisitions are beneficial to the Companys long term strategy, as well as identifying businesses or product lines that no longer fit within the Companys strategic plan. Periodically, the Company supplements internal growth by acquiring businesses with prominent consumer focused, retail brands and improving the profitability of such businesses through the implementation of the Companys strategic initiatives. Other strategic criteria for an acquisition include the Companys ability to grow the business, its importance to key customers, its relationship to existing product lines, its function as a low cost source of supply, its ability to provide the Company with an entrance into a new market, and the extent to which the Company can improve operational efficiency through shared resources. In addition, the Company will consider the business actual and potential impact on the operating performance of the Companys Group at issue. The Company did not make significant acquisitions during 2004, as the priority was the reduction of debt. During 2005, the Company intends to pursue acquisition opportunities to complement internal growth. In addition to adding businesses or product lines to the Companys current portfolio, the Company continues to rationalize low margin product lines that do not fit within the 18 Companys strategic plan. In 2005, the Company plans to exit approximately $200 million in low margin product lines in the Rubbermaid Home Products, Graco, Swish UK, and Office Products businesses. 2. Invest in High Margin Businesses: The Company continues to focus significant resources on enhancing its new product development pipeline, as well as strengthening the Companys numerous brands through targeted advertising. The Company believes that the introduction of innovative new products coupled with strong brands will improve the Companys profit margin by creating demand from its end user. In 2005, the Company intends to make additional investments in SGA of about $40 million, (primarily in the office products and tools hardware segments), which will be partially offset by the positive impact of the U.S. pension curtailment (discussed in Footnote 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The net impact is an expected increase in SGA of about $20 million. 3. Address Raw Material Inflation: The Company has several businesses that are significantly impacted by commodity inflation. The Company has historically combated these cost increases through organic productivity initiatives. However, due to the continued inflation pressure within several of its core commodity purchases, the Company has implemented price increases to offset a portion of the increased costs. For 2005, the Company has estimated raw material inflation of approximately $170 million and expects pricing increases to contribute approximately $100 million in 2005. 4. Reduce Manufacturing Overhead: The Company is committed to reducing its manufacturing costs by at least five percent annually. As a result of the recent divestiture and product line rationalization programs, the Company is focusing on reengineering its manufacturing overhead structure to accommodate its current manufacturing base. In connection with this goal, the Company is committed to deploying and implementing Newell OPEX. Significant opportunity remains for the Company in 2005, especially in the Office Products segment. The continued focus on implementing Newell OPEX is expected to allow the Company to deliver productivity savings, thereby delivering long term gross margin expansion, despite raw material inflation. As part of this strategy, the Company intends to continue to implement its capital spending discipline throughout the organization and expects to spend $125 to $150 million in 2005. Consolidated Results of Operations The following table sets forth for the periods indicated items from the Consolidated Statements of Operations as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2004 2003 2002 Net sales $6,748.4 100.0 % $6,899.0 100.0 % $6,436.9 100.0 % Cost of products sold 4,857.9 72.0 4,961.8 71.9 4,608.2 71.6 Gross margin 1,890.5 28.0 1,937.2 28.1 1,828.7 28.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,269.8 18.8 1,221.5 17.7 1,167.2 18.1 Impairment charge 374.0 5.5 34.5 0.5 Restructuring costs 52.1 0.8 184.0 2.7 101.8 1.6 Operating income 194.6 2.9 497.2 7.2 559.7 8.7 Nonoperating expenses: Interest expense, net 119.3 1.8 134.3 1.9 132.6 2.1 Other (income) expense, net (11.0 ) (0.2 ) 25.6 0.4 28.6 0.4 Net nonoperating expenses 108.3 1.6 159.9 2.3 161.2 2.5 Income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 86.3 1.3 337.3 4.9 398.5 6.2 Income taxes 105.4 1.6 124.1 1.8 133.5 2.1 Net (loss) income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change (19.1 ) (0.3 ) 213.2 3.1 265.0 4.1 (Loss) gain from discontinued operations, net of tax (97.0 ) (1.4 ) (259.8 ) (3.8 ) 46.5 0.7 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax (514.9 ) (8.0 ) Net loss ($116.1 ) (1.7 )% ($46.6 ) (0.7 )% ($203.4 ) (3.2 )% 19 Results of Operations 2004 vs. 2003 Net sales decreased $150.6 million, or 2.2%, in 2004. The decrease resulted primarily from product line rationalization of approximately $275 million, or 4.0%, unfavorable pricing of $3 million, or 0.1%, the disposal of the Cosmolab business which had $10 million in sales in 2003, and core sales decline of $22 million, or 0.2%, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation of $160 million, or 2.3%, for the period. Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, in 2004 was 28.0%, or $1,890.5 million, versus 28.1%, or $1,937.2 million, in 2003. The decline in gross margin is primarily related to raw material inflation of $116 million and unfavorable pricing of $3 million, partially offset by favorable mix driven by the rationalization of unprofitable product lines, primarily in the Rubbermaid Home Products business, and net productivity and other savings of $57 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) were 18.8% of net sales, or $1,269.8 million in 2004, versus 17.7%, or $1,221.5 million, in 2003. The increase in SGA reflects a foreign currency impact of $44 million and pension cost increases of $16 million. All other SGA was down $12 million with strategic investments more than offset by streamlining initiatives. The Company recorded non cash pretax impairment charges of $374.0 million in 2004 versus $34.5 million in 2003. These charges were required to write down certain assets to fair value. See Footnote 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company recorded pre tax strategic restructuring costs of $52.1 million ($35.9 million after tax) and $184.0 million ($124.4 million after tax) for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2004 pre tax charge included $44.6 million of facility and other exit costs, $8.1 million of employee severance and termination benefits, and ($0.6) million of income resulting from a change in estimate in other restructuring costs. The 2003 pre tax charge included $82.8 million of facility and other exit costs, $75.7 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $25.5 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. See Footnote 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the strategic restructuring plan. Operating income in 2004 was 2.9% of net sales, or $194.6 million, versus 7.2% of net sales, or $497.2 million, in 2003. The decrease in operating income is the result of the factors described above. Net nonoperating expenses for 2004 were 1.6% of net sales, or $108.3 million, versus 2.3%, or $159.9 million, for 2003. In 2003, the Company recognized a $30.4 million non cash pre tax loss on the sale of its Cosmolab and Photo Fashions businesses. Net interest expense decreased $15.0 million for 2004 compared to 2003 primarily as a result of lower average debt outstanding, partially offset by increased interest rates. See Footnote 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change for 2004 was $86.3 million, compared to $337.3 million for 2003. The decrease relates to the factors described above. The effective tax rate was 122.1% for the year ended 2004 versus 36.8% for the year ended 2003. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the non deductibility associated with a portion of the Companys $374.0 million impairment charge. See Footnotes 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Net (loss)/income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change was ($19.1) million in 2004 versus $213.2 million in 2003. Diluted (loss)/earnings per share from continuing operations was ($0.07) for 2004 compared to $0.78 for 2003. 20 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $97.0 million in 2004 versus $259.8 million in 2003. Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations was $0.35 for 2004 compared to $0.95 for 2003. See Footnote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Net loss for 2004 was $116.1 million compared to $46.6 million in 2003. Basic and diluted loss per share in 2004 was $0.42 versus $0.17 in 2003. The increase in net loss and loss per share was primarily due to the impairment charge recorded in 2004, partially offset by a decrease in the loss recognized from discontinued operations. See Footnotes 2 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Results of Operations 2003 vs. 2002 Net sales increased $462.1 million, or 7.2%, in 2003. The increase in sales is primarily related to sales from recently acquired businesses of approximately $339.2 million, favorable foreign currency of $217.1 million and core sales growth and other of $70.7 million, partially offset by a decrease of $39.9 million in sales from the Cosmolab business divested in March 2003 and negative pricing of $125.0 million. Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, in 2003 was 28.1%, or $1,937.2 million, versus 28.4%, or $1,828.7 million, in 2002. The reduction in gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, is primarily related to unfavorable pricing of $125 million, or 1.9% of net sales, partially offset by net productivity of $105 million, or 1.6% of net sales. Increased resin costs of $75 million negatively impacted gross margin and is included as a reduction in net productivity. The favorable impact of the LENOX acquisition (0.7 points) was more than offset by unfavorable mix in the remainder of our businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) were 17.7% of net sales, or $1,221.5 million, in 2003 and 18.1%, or $1,167.2 million, in 2002. The $54.3 million increase in SGA related primarily to recently acquired businesses of approximately $85 million. All other SGA was down $31 million with streamlining initiatives of $126 million more than offsetting increases from currency translation, pension and strategic investments. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $34.5 million associated with the decision to exit certain product lines. See Footnote 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company recorded pre tax strategic restructuring charges of $184.0 million ($124.4 million after tax) and $101.8 million ($67.7 million after tax) in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2003 pre tax charge included $82.8 million of facility and other exit costs, $75.7 million of employee severance and termination benefits, and $25.5 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. The 2002 pre tax charge included $26.0 million of facility and other exit costs, $67.3 million of employee severance and termination benefits, and $8.5 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. See Footnote 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the strategic restructuring plan. Operating income in 2003 was 7.2% of net sales, or $497.2 million, versus 8.7% of net sales, or $559.7 million, in 2002. The decrease in operating income is primarily the result of the factors described above. Income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting change in 2003 was $337.3 million, a $61.2 million decrease from $398.5 million in 2002. The decrease relates primarily to the factors noted above. The effective tax rate was 36.8% for the year ended 2003 versus 33.5% in the prior year. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the utilization in 2002 of foreign net operating losses to offset earnings recorded in foreign tax jurisdictions. See Footnote 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Net income before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change in 2003 was $213.2 million, a $51.8 million decrease from $265.0 million in 2002. Diluted income per share before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of accounting change was $0.78 in 2003 compared to $0.99 in 2002. 21 (Loss)/gain from discontinued operations, net of tax, was ($259.8) million in 2003 versus $46.5 million in 2002. Diluted (loss)/earnings per share from discontinued operations was ($0.95) for 2003 versus $0.17 for 2002. See Footnote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company completed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, which resulted in an impairment charge of $514.9 million, net of tax. See Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and the cumulative effect of accounting change for goodwill. Net loss for 2003 was $46.6 million compared to $203.4 million in 2002. Basic and diluted loss per share in 2003 was $0.17 versus $0.76 in 2002. The decrease in net loss and loss per share was primarily due to the factors noted above. Business Segment Operating Results 2004 vs. 2003 Business Segment Operating Results The Company operates in five general segments: Net sales by segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2004 2003 % Change Cleaning Organization $1,858.1 $2,013.7 (7.7 )% Office Products 1,686.2 1,681.2 0.3 Tools Hardware 1,218.7 1,199.7 1.6 Home Fashions 906.8 901.0 0.6 Other 1,078.6 1,103.4 (2.2 ) Total Net Sales $6,748.4 $6,899.0 (2.2 )% Operating income by segment was as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2004 2003 % Change Cleaning Organization $90.8 $92.0 (1.3 )% Office Products 261.9 309.6 (15.4 ) Tools Hardware 181.8 179.3 1.4 Home Fashions 33.0 44.4 (25.7 ) Other 92.6 120.7 (23.3 ) Corporate (39.4 ) (30.3 ) Impairment charge (374.0 ) (34.5 ) Restructuring costs (52.1 ) (184.0 ) Total Operating Income $194.6 $497.2 (60.9 )% Cleaning Organization Net sales for 2004 were $1,858.1 million, a decrease of $155.6 million, or 7.7%, from $2,013.7 million in 2003. The 7.7% sales decrease was driven primarily by a decline in the Rubbermaid Home Products business due to planned low margin product line rationalizations, partially offset by favorable pricing and increases in core product lines in the Rubbermaid Foodservice, Rubbermaid Commercial, and Rubbermaid Asia Pacific businesses. Operating income for 2004 was $90.8 million, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 1.3%, from $92.0 million in 2003. The decrease in operating income is primarily the result of higher raw material costs (primarily resin), partially offset by favorable pricing and improvement in Rubbermaid Commercial and Rubbermaid Asia Pacific as a result of sales growth. 22 Office Products Net sales for 2004 were $1,686.2 million, an increase of $5.0 million, or 0.3%, from $1,681.2 million in 2003. The increase in net sales primarily resulted from a single digit increase in the writing instruments business on the strength of new products, largely offset by the exit of low margin resin based products in the Eldon office products business. Operating income for 2004 was $261.9 million, a decrease of $47.7 million, or 15.4%, from $309.6 million in 2003. The decrease in operating income was driven by restructuring related costs in the European writing instruments business and raw material inflation, primarily in resin costs in the Eldon office products division, partially offset by improvement in the Sanford Latin America and Sanford Asia Pacific businesses. Tools Hardware Net sales for 2004 were $1,218.7 million, an increase of $19.0 million, or 1.6%, from $1,199.7 million in 2003. The increase in net sales was driven by increases in the LENOX and BernzOmatic businesses. Operating income for 2004 was $181.8 million, an increase of $2.5 million, or 1.4%, from $179.3 million in 2003. The improvement in operating income was generated primarily by productivity savings, sales increases and streamlining initiatives, partially offset by raw material inflation. Home Fashions Net sales for 2004 were $906.8 million, an increase of $5.8 million, or 0.6%, from $901.0 million in 2003. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by favorable foreign currency fluctuation, partially offset by planned product line exits in the Swish UK business. Operating income for 2004 was $33.0 million, a decrease of $11.4 million, or 25.7%, from $44.4 million in 2003. The decrease in operating income is primarily the result of raw material inflation and charges related to the liquidation of certain product lines in the segment. Other Net sales for 2004 were $1,078.6 million, a decrease of $24.8 million, or 2.2%, from $1,103.4 million in 2003. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to the sale of Cosmolab in March 2003, which contributed $10 million in sales in 2003, and declines experienced in the Graco and Cookware Europe businesses. Operating income for 2004 was $92.6 million, a decrease of $28.1 million, or 23.3%, from $120.7 million in 2003. The decrease in operating income was due primarily to sales decreases at Graco and Cookware Europe and raw material inflation in resin based products. 2003 vs. 2002 Business Segment Operating Results Net sales by segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2003 2002 % Change Cleaning Organization $2,013.7 $1,901.8 5.9 % Office Products 1,681.2 1,684.1 (0.2 ) Tools Hardware 1,199.7 783.0 53.2 Home Fashions 901.0 955.7 (5.7 ) Other 1,103.4 1,112.3 (0.8 ) Total Net Sales $6,899.0 $6,436.9 7.2 % 23 Operating income by segment was as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions): 2003 2002 % Change Cleaning Organization $92.0 $169.0 (45.6 )% Office Products 309.6 306.1 1.1 Tools Hardware 179.3 79.2 126.4 Home Fashions 44.4 44.3 0.2 Other 120.7 94.0 28.4 Corporate (30.3 ) (31.1 ) Impairment charge (34.5 ) Restructuring costs (184.0 ) (101.8 ) Total Operating Income $497.2 $559.7 (11.2 )% Cleaning Organization Net sales for 2003 were $2,013.7 million, an increase of $111.9 million, or 5.9%, from $1,901.8 million in 2002. The 5.9% sales growth was primarily due to mid single digit sales growth at the Rubbermaid Home Products division. The primary reason for the overall sales increase was continued growth in sales of newer products, such as the Rubbermaid TakeAlongs, the Tool Tower, the Sports Station, the Endurance Cooler and other product offerings, partially offset by price reductions. Operating income for 2003 was $92.0 million, a decrease of $77.0 million, or 45.6%, from $169.0 million in 2002. The decrease in operating income is primarily the result of higher raw material costs (primarily resin) and pricing pressure on non differentiated items in its Rubbermaid Home Products business. Office Products Net sales for 2003 were $1,681.2 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 0.2%, from $1,684.1 million in 2002. The slight decrease in net sales primarily resulted from continued softness in the commercial sector. Operating income for 2003 was $309.6 million, an increase of $3.5 million, or 1.1%, from $306.1 million in 2002. Operating income was positively impacted by productivity and favorable mix management, partially offset by increased investments in marketing initiatives. Tools Hardware Net sales for 2003 were $1,199.7 million, an increase of $416.7 million, or 53.2%, from $783.0 million in 2002. The increase in net sales is primarily due to incremental sales resulting from the LENOX and IRWIN acquisitions, including strong sales in the IRWIN North America division driven by new products, most notably the success of the Strait Line products. Operating income for 2003 was $179.3 million, an increase of $100.1 million, or 126.4%, from $79.2 million in 2002. The improvement in operating income was driven by strong productivity, new products and the acquisitions of LENOX and IRWIN. Home Fashions Net sales for 2003 were $901.0 million, a decrease of $54.7 million, or 5.7%, from $955.7 million in 2002. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to the planned exit of low margin product lines in the Levolor/Kirsch business. Operating income for 2003 was $44.4 million, an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.2%, from $44.3 million in 2002. An improvement in Home Dcor Europe was largely offset by decreases in Levolor/Kirsch, primarily due to the reduction of sales. Other Net sales for 2003 were $1,103.4 million, a decrease of $8.9 million, or 0.8%, from $1,112.3 million in 2002. The decrease in sales resulted primarily from a $39.9 million decrease due to the divestiture of the Cosmolab business, largely offset by strong sales in the high end cookware business. 24 Operating income for 2003 was $120.7 million, an increase of $26.7 million, or 28.4%, from $94.0 million in 2002. The main drivers of this increase in operating income were new product introductions coupled with the increased sales in the high end cookware business. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents increased as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Cash provided by operating activities $660.0 $773.2 $868.9 Cash provided by/(used in) investing activities 189.6 (716.1 ) (486.5 ) Cash (used in)/provided by financing activities (494.1 ) 31.4 (334.9 ) Exchange effect on cash and cash equivalents 5.7 0.8 0.8 Increase in cash and cash equivalents $361.2 $89.3 $48.3 Sources The Companys primary sources of liquidity and capital resources include cash provided by operations, proceeds from divestitures and use of available borrowing facilities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $660.0 million compared to $773.2 million for the comparable period of 2003. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a reduction in the year over year improvement in working capital and other assets in 2004 compared to 2003 and a reduction in cash received from the termination of certain interest rate swap arrangements. In 2004, the Company received cash proceeds of $262.8 million related to the sale of businesses, compared to $10.2 million in 2003. The Company used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of these businesses to pay off its commercial paper borrowings. In 2004, the Company generated $55.3 million of cash related to the sale of other non current assets, primarily as a result of the sale of vacant facilities and equipment under the restructuring program, a $21.6 million increase over 2003. In 2004, the Company received proceeds from the issuance of debt of $33.9 million compared to $1,044.0 million in 2003. On January 10, 2003, the Company completed the sale of 6.67 million shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $30.10 per share pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Total proceeds from the sale were approximately $200.8 million, resulting in net proceeds to the Company, after expenses, of $200.1 million. The proceeds were used to reduce the Companys commercial paper borrowings. The Company has a $1.05 billion universal shelf registration statement that became effective in April 2003 under which debt and equity securities may be issued. In 2003, $400.0 million of medium term notes were issued under this shelf registration statement, the proceeds of which were used to pay down commercial paper. The Company has short term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that are available for short term financing. Borrowings under the Companys uncommitted lines of credit are subject to the discretion of the lender. The Companys lines of credit do not have a material impact on the Companys liquidity. Borrowings under the Companys lines of credit at December 31, 2004 and 2003 totaled $21.3 million and $21.9 million, respectively. The Company completed a $1,300.0 million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility (the Revolver) on June 14, 2002. The Revolver consisted of a $650.0 million 364 day credit agreement and a $650.0 million five year credit agreement. The Company did not roll over the 364 day credit agreement in June of 2004, thereby reducing the 25 Revolver to $650.0 million in available credit as of December 31, 2004. The Companys $650.0 million five year Syndicated Revolving Credit Agreement that is scheduled to expire in June 2007 remains in place. At December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings under the Revolver. In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may issue up to $650.0 million of commercial paper. The Revolver provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. At December 31, 2004, no commercial paper was outstanding. The Revolver permits the Company to borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms. The Revolver requires, among other things, that the Company maintain certain Interest Coverage and Total Indebtedness to Total Capital Ratio, as defined in the agreement. The agreement also limits Subsidiary Indebtedness. As of December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with this agreement. Under a 2001 receivables facility with a financial institution, the Company created a financing entity that is consolidated in the Companys financial statements. Under this facility, the Company regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity to sell an undivided interest in substantially all of the Companys United States trade receivables to the financing entity. In 2001, the financing entity issued $450.0 million in preferred debt securities to the financial institution. Those preferred debt securities must be retired or redeemed before the Company can have access to the financing entitys receivables. Also, certain levels of accounts receivable write offs and other events would permit the financial institution to terminate the receivables lending commitment and require redemption of the preferred debt securities. The receivables and the $450.0 million preferred debt securities are recorded in the consolidated accounts of the Company. Because this debt matures in 2008, the entire amount is considered to be long term debt. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the aggregate amount of outstanding receivables sold under the agreement was $720.9 million and $777.4 million, respectively. Uses The Companys primary uses of liquidity and capital resources include acquisitions, payments on notes payable, long term debt, dividend payments and capital expenditures. Cash used for acquisitions was $6.6 million in 2004, compared to $460.0 million in 2003. The cash used in 2003 related primarily to the acquisition of LENOX, which was funded through the issuance of commercial paper. The Company did not invest in significant acquisitions during 2004, as its priority was the reduction of debt. Capital expenditures were $121.9 million and $300.0 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to the Companys decision to reduce capital investment in the Rubbermaid Home Products business and the sale of several capital intense businesses. In 2004, the Company made payments on notes payable and long term debt of $298.4 million compared to $989.6 million in 2003. In 2004, the Company purchased 825,000 shares of its Convertible Preferred Securities from a holder for $43.6875 per share. The Company paid a total of $36.0 million. In the first quarter of 2005, the Company purchased 550,000 shares of its Preferred Securities from a holder for $47.375 per share. The Company paid a total of $26.1 million. Aggregate dividends paid were $231.0 million and $230.9 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash used for restructuring activities, including acquisition integration plans, was $90.1 million and $127.5 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The cash payments primarily relate to employee termination benefits. In 2004, the Company made a voluntary $50.0 million cash contribution to fund the Companys pension plan. The Company expects to contribute $25.0 million to its foreign pension plans in 2005. Retained earnings decreased in 2004 by $347.1 million. The reduction in retained earnings is due to cash dividends paid on common stock and the current year net loss. 26 Working capital at December 31, 2004 was $1,141.1 million compared to $978.2 million at December 31, 2003. The current ratio at December 31, 2004 was 1.61:1 compared to 1.48:1 at December 31, 2003. The increase in working capital and the current ratio is due to an increase in cash on hand at December 31, 2004 from the sale of businesses and fixed assets, partially offset by the pay down of debt, and an increase in inventory due to inventory build associated with improving service levels. Total debt to total capitalization (total debt is net of cash and cash equivalents, and total capitalization includes total debt and stockholders equity) was .55:1 at December 31, 2004 and .58:1 at December 31, 2003. The Company believes that cash provided from operations and available borrowing facilities will continue to provide adequate support for the cash needs of existing businesses on a short term basis; however, certain events, such as significant acquisitions, could require additional external financing on a long term basis. Pension Liability Effective December 31, 2004, the Company froze its defined benefit pension plan for its entire non union U.S. workforce. As a result of this curtailment, the Company will reduce its pension obligation by $50.3 million and anticipates recording a curtailment gain related to negative prior service cost in the first quarter of 2005 in the range of $14 to $16 million. The Companys measurement date with respect to this plan is September 30th. The Company offered a special termination benefit to certain of its employees that elected early retirement and recorded a special termination benefit charge in the amount of $1.8 million in 2004. The Company replaced the defined benefit pension plan with a defined contribution plan, whereby the Company will make additional contributions to the Companys sponsored employee profit sharing plan. The new defined contribution has a five year cliff vesting schedule, but allows prior years of service to be applied against the vesting. Resolution of Income Tax Contingency During the first quarter of 2005, the Company reached agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) relating to the appropriate treatment of a specific transaction reflected on the Companys 2003 US federal income tax return. The Company requested accelerated review of the transaction under the IRS Pre Filing Agreement Program that resulted in affirmative resolution in late January 2005. The Companys December 31, 2004 and 2003 balance sheet reflected a $58 million and $57 million contingency reserve, respectively, for this transaction pending resolution of the appropriate treatment with the IRS. The benefit of this transaction will be recorded in the Companys first quarter 2005 income statement. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in its consolidated financial statements. Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of December 31, 2004 and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements. The following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations listed below are expected to have on the Companys cash flow in the indicated period. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2004. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements, as referenced in the table (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt maturities (1) $2,609.9 $185.6 $416.2 $704.3 $1,303.8 Interest on long term debt (2) 1,420.7 127.5 230.6 178.6 884.0 27 Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations (3) 382.8 100.4 132.4 75.8 74.2 Purchase obligations (4) 510.1 488.3 19.4 0.6 1.8 Total contractual obligation (5) $4,919.0 $901.6 $798.2 $955.6 $2,263.6 (1) Amounts represent contractual obligations due, excluding interest, based on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2004. For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnotes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Amount represents estimated interest expense on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2004. Interest on floating debt was estimated using the index rate in effect as of December 31, 2004. For further information relating to this obligation, see Footnotes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Amounts represent contractual minimum lease obligations on operating leases as of December 31, 2004. For further information relating to this obligation, see Footnote 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Primarily consists of purchase commitments entered into as of December 31, 2004 for finished goods, raw materials, components and services pursuant to legally enforceable and binding obligations, which include all significant terms. (5) Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2004 balance sheet as current liabilities, except for current portion of long term debt. The Company also has obligations with respect to its pension and post retirement medical benefit plans. See Footnote 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had $100.7 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Companys self insurance programs, including workers compensation, product liability, and medical. See Footnote 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2004, the Company did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Critical Accounting Policies The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections describe the Companys critical accounting policies. Revenue Recognition Revenue from sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers is recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership change, which generally occurs upon shipment to customers. Revenue is net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), co op advertising and other sales related discounts. Recovery of Accounts Receivable The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. When aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Companys estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted. Inventory Reserves The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future 28 demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets The Company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its annual strategic planning process for all of its businesses. The Company also tests for impairment if events or circumstances occur subsequent to the Companys annual impairment tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the indefinite life intangible asset below its carrying amount. The Company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the Companys customer base, or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers. The Company assesses the fair value of its reporting units for its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks and trade names) impairment tests, generally based upon a discounted cash flow methodology. The discounted cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses, working capital, terminal value, and market discount rates. The underlying assumptions used are consistent with those used in the strategic plan. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value, goodwill impairment may be present. The Company measures the goodwill impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 142 in 2002, the Company performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and recorded a pre tax impairment charge of $538.0 million, ($514.9 million net of taxes). If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recorded intangible asset exceeds the fair value. Product Liability Reserves The Company has a self insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance. The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves. As a result of the most recent analysis, the Company has estimated these reserves at $25.5 million. The Companys actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the Companys product liability reserve. While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company and such additional losses may be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Environmental Reserves The Company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as, contract and other disputes. The Company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based largely on historical experience. The estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts, including legal fees, where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. No insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the Companys cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Companys cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to long term operations and maintenance CERCLA matters which are estimated at present value. See Footnote 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 29 Income Tax Contingencies The Company establishes a tax contingency reserve for certain tax exposures when it is not probable that the Companys tax position will be ultimately sustained. The Company generally assesses its tax contingency reserves on a quarterly basis. The Company adjusts a tax contingency reserve balance when it becomes probable that the Companys tax position will ultimately be sustained, which generally occurs when the statute of limitations for a specific exposure item has expired or when the Company has reached agreement with the taxing authorities on the treatment of an item. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements. International Operations The Companys non U.S. sales increased 1.4% in 2004, after increasing 13.0% in 2003. In both 2004 and 2003, the increases primarily related to foreign currency movement, largely in Europe. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Companys non U.S. business accounted for approximately 32%, 31% and 29% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Changes in both U.S. and non U.S. net sales are shown below for the years ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2004 vs. 2003 vs. 2003 % 2002 % 2004 2003 2002 Change Change Net sales: U.S $4,607.2 $4,788.2 $4,569.5 (3.8 )% 4.8 % Non U.S 2,141.2 2,110.8 1,867.4 1.4 13.0 $6,748.4 $6,899.0 $6,436.9 (2.2 )% 7.2 % Forward Looking Statements Forward looking statements in this Report are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward looking statements may relate to, but are not limited to, information or assumptions about sales (including pricing), income/(loss), earnings per share, return on equity, return on invested capital, capital expenditures, working capital, cash flow, dividends, capital structure, debt to capitalization ratios, interest rates, internal growth rates, restructuring, impairment and other charges, potential losses on divestitures, impact of changes in accounting standards, pending legal proceedings and claims (including environmental matters), future economic performance, operating income improvements, costs and cost savings (including raw material inflation, productivity and streamlining), synergies, managements plans, goals and objectives for future operations and growth or the assumptions relating to any of the forward looking statements. The Company cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees because there are inherent difficulties in predicting future results. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those matters set forth in this Report and Exhibit 99.1 to this Report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The Companys primary market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices. Pursuant to the Companys policies, natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. 30 The Company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions, and, for qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense. The Companys foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less. The Company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form: offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows, structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk, converting excess foreign currency deposits into U.S. dollars or the relevant functional currency and avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency. In addition, the Company utilizes forward contracts and purchase options to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions. Derivatives used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company purchases certain raw materials, including resin, steel and aluminum, which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors. While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, a variety of programs, including periodic raw material purchases, purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the Company address this risk. Generally, the Company does not use derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. The amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the Company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model. The value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variance/covariance approach and include substantially all market risk exposures (specifically excluding equity method investments). The fair value losses shown in the table below do not have an impact on current results of operations or financial condition, but are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest rates. The following table indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (in millions, except percentages): 2004 December 31, 2003 December 31, Confidence Market Risk Average 2004 Average 2003 Level Interest rates $12.1 $11.3 $20.0 $12.8 95 % Foreign exchange $2.2 $1.9 $1.3 $1.5 95 % The 95% confidence interval signifies the Companys degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the Companys favor. The value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse. Actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is considered highly unlikely that the Company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. 31
