ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Executive Overview Newell Rubbermaid is a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer products and their commercial extensions, serving a wide array of retail channels including department stores, discount stores, warehouse clubs, home centers, hardware stores, commercial distributors, office superstores, contract stationers, automotive stores and 18 baby superstores. The Companys basic business strategy is to create brands that matter by marketing a multi product offering of consumer and commercial products, backed by a focus on innovation and customer service excellence, in order to achieve maximum results for its stockholders. The Company conducts businesses in five operating segments as follows: Segment Description of Products Cleaning Organization Material handling, cleaning, refuse, indoor/outdoor organization, home storage, food storage Office Products Ballpoint/roller ball pens, markers, highlighters, pencils, correction fluids, office products, art supplies, on demand labeling products Tools Hardware Hand tools, power tool accessories, manual paint applicators, cabinet, window and convenience hardware, propane torches, solder Home Fashions Drapery hardware, window treatments Other Operating segments that do not meet aggregation criteria, including aluminum and stainless steel cookware, hair care accessory products, infant and juvenile products, including toys, high chairs, car seats, strollers and play yards The Company remains committed to investing in strategic brands and new product development, having best cost platforms, and strengthening its portfolio of businesses. The Company will continue to make investments in advertising, promotion, and new product development in its invest businesses, which encompass the Companys high potential, high margin brands, while taking action to improve profitability in its fix businesses, which encompass many of the Companys low margin product lines. The Company defines invest businesses as those having high margin opportunity and the ability to generate profitable growth through innovative new products and investments in brand building and marketing. Invest businesses are generally meeting or exceeding the companys minimum financial targets and collectively generate above average operating income margins. Fix businesses are characterized as having unacceptable profitability levels. Managements primary focus for fix businesses is to take significant actions to improve overall profitability. For all periods presented, the Company classified Rubbermaid Home Products, Home Fashions, Goody, Graco and Little Tikes as fix businesses. Beginning in 2006, Graco and Goody will be classified as invest businesses. The following section details the Companys performance in each of its 2005 objectives: Strengthen/Broaden its Portfolio of Businesses The Company continues to evaluate its current portfolio and intends to pursue acquisition opportunities to complement internal growth. In addition to acquiring high potential businesses or product lines, such as DYMO, the Company is focused on divesting non strategic businesses, such as the divested Curver and the European Cookware businesses, and rationalizing low margin product lines that do not fit within the Companys strategy. In 2005 and 2004, the Company rationalized $200 million and $257 million, respectively, in low margin product sales. See Footnote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on acquisitions. See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on divestitures. Invest in High Margin Businesses The Company continues to focus significant resources on enhancing its new product development pipeline, as well as strengthening the Companys numerous brands through targeted advertising and promotion. In 2005, the Company made additional investments in SGA (primarily in the Office Products and Tools Hardware segments) through increased expenditures for advertising and promotion. In order to partially fund increases in SGA in the invest businesses, the Company is focused on streamlining its operations to reduce non strategic costs throughout the organization. Address Raw Material Inflation The Company has several businesses that have been significantly impacted by raw material inflation, particularly in resin and to a lesser extent, steel. The Company historically combated such cost increases through internal 19 productivity initiatives. However, due to the continued inflationary pressure in raw materials, the Company has implemented sales price increases to offset a portion of the increased costs. In 2005, the Company experienced raw material inflation of approximately $153 million (primarily in resin and steel), partially offset by pricing increases of approximately $132 million. The Company expects such inflationary pressures to continue in 2006. The Company has reduced the volume of its resin purchases through product line rationalization and divestitures in 2005. In 2005, the Company purchased approximately 900 million pounds of resin and expects to purchase approximately 10% less in 2006. Reduce Manufacturing Overhead The Company is committed to reducing the cost of manufacturing. The primary focus is on reducing its manufacturing overhead structure and labor costs. In 2005, the Company announced a global initiative referred to as Project Acceleration aimed at strengthening and transforming the Companys portfolio. In connection with Project Acceleration, in September 2005 the Board of Directors of the Company approved a three year restructuring plan (the Plan), which commenced in December 2005. While the Board of Directors has approved the overall plan, specific approval of each individual project is required prior to commencing the action in accordance with the Companys schedule of corporate authority. The Plan is designed to reduce manufacturing overhead by strategically sourcing and manufacturing products in lower cost countries. The Company began executing the Plan in the fourth quarter of 2005 and recorded $51.3 million in non cash restructuring charges. See Footnote 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring. The Plan is expected to result in cumulative restructuring charges totaling between $350 million and $400 million ($295 million $340 million after tax), with between $170 million and $200 million ($145 million $170 million after tax) to be incurred in 2006. Approximately 60% of the cumulative charges under Project Acceleration are expected to be cash charges. The Company expects annual savings from the plan to exceed $120 million upon conclusion of the program. See Footnote 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, the Company is committed to the deployment of Newell Operational Excellence. Newell Operational Excellence is the process that the Company has developed using best practices from methodologies such as Six Sigma, Kaizen, Kanban and other lean manufacturing principles. The Company delivered approximately $87 million of productivity savings, excluding raw material inflation, during 2005. 2006 Priorities: In 2006, management is focused on the following key objectives: 1. Invest in Strategic Brands to Deliver Top Line Growth: The Companys emphasis will be to deliver sales growth through increased investments in marketing and new product development on the strongest brands within its invest businesses. The Company will focus on developing best in class practices for innovation and branding. The Companys objective is to build brands that really matter to its consumers. The Company will put in the systems to understand its consumers in detail how they use its products, what they value, and how to delight them or excite them. The Company will invest in more innovation that differentiates its products. The Company will have to invest more in advertising and other consumer marketing to increase awareness as well as trial and repeat purchases. Further, the Company will have to be able to measure the effectiveness of those increased marketing investments. 2. Reduce Supply Chain Costs/Execute Project Acceleration: Through Newell Operational Excellence and previous restructuring, the Company has made significant progress in reducing its supply chain costs and delivering productivity savings. The Company will broaden the supply chain efforts to include purchasing and distribution transportation. Project Acceleration is designed to reduce manufacturing overhead and labor costs by strategically sourcing and manufacturing products in lower cost countries. 3. Strengthen the Portfolio: The Company has made significant progress in strengthening its portfolio over the past three years. The Company has made selective acquisitions of new product lines. In 2005, the Company 20 acquired DYMO, a global leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing on demand labeling solutions, and plans to integrate DYMO into its Office Products segment in 2006. This acquisition will strengthen the Companys global leadership position in the Office Products segment by expanding and enhancing the Companys product lines and customer base. In 2003, the Company acquired LENOX, a leading manufacturer of power tools accessories and hand tools. The Company also divests businesses that do not fit its business model (i.e., businesses that can sustain high margins and grow through investments in brands and new product innovation). In 2004, the Company sold its U.S. picture frame business (Burnes), its Anchor Hocking glassware business, its Mirro cookware business, its Panex Brazilian low end cookware business, its European picture frames business and its Little Tikes Commercial Playground Systems business. In 2005, the Company sold its Curver business and entered into an agreement to sell its European Cookware business, completing this sale in January 2006. The Company will continue to review opportunities to optimize the portfolio through selective acquisitions and divestitures. 4. Streamline Non Strategic SGA: In 2006, the Company will continue to streamline its non strategic SGA, especially in its fix businesses, by challenging non strategic costs and SGA investments in these businesses. The Company plans to use those savings to fund investments in SGA in its invest businesses, primarily through increased advertising, new product development, promotion and brand building activities. Consolidated Results of Operations The following table sets forth for the periods indicated items from the Consolidated Statements of Operations as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $6,342.5 100.0 % $6,479.8 100.0 % $6,614.8 100.0 % Cost of products sold 4,448.1 70.1 4,641.0 71.6 4,732.7 71.5 Gross margin 1,894.4 29.9 1,838.8 28.4 1,882.1 28.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,265.6 20.0 1,208.8 18.7 1,160.7 17.5 Impairment charges 34.4 0.5 295.1 4.6 34.5 0.5 Restructuring costs 72.2 1.1 44.2 0.7 189.3 2.9 Operating income 522.2 8.2 290.7 4.5 497.6 7.5 Nonoperating expenses: Interest expense, net 127.1 2.0 119.3 1.8 134.3 2.0 Other (income) expense, net (23.0 ) (0.4 ) (3.2 ) 25.6 0.4 Net nonoperating expenses 104.1 1.6 116.1 1.8 159.9 2.4 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 418.1 6.6 174.6 2.7 337.7 5.1 Income taxes 61.7 1.0 104.0 1.6 119.8 1.8 Income from continuing operations 356.4 5.6 70.6 1.1 217.9 3.3 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (105.1 ) (1.7 ) (186.7 ) (2.9 ) (264.5 ) (4.0 ) Net income (loss) $251.3 4.0 % ($116.1 ) (1.8 )% ($46.6 ) (0.7 )% Results of Operations 2005 vs. 2004 Net sales for 2005 were $6,342.5 million, representing a decrease of $137.3 million, or 2.1% from $6,479.8 million for 2004, consisting of the following (in millions, except percentages): $ % Favorable currency translation $48 0.7 % Favorable pricing 132 2.0 Product line rationalization (200 ) (3.1 ) Core sales decline (142 ) (2.1 ) Acquired business sales 25 0.4 ($137 ) (2.1 )% 21 Net sales in the Companys invest businesses improved 2.0% for 2005 versus 2004, led by double digit growth in the LENOX tools businesses and high single digit growth in Rubbermaid Commercial Products and IRWIN branded tools businesses. The acquisition of DYMO contributed $24.9 million in net sales in 2005. Net sales in the Companys fix businesses declined 8.0% for 2005 versus 2004, as a result of low margin product line exits in Rubbermaid Home Products and core sales declines in the Little Tikes battery operated products and European Window Fashion businesses. Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2005 was 29.9%, or $1,894.4 million, versus 28.4%, or $1,838.8 million, for 2004. The improvement in gross margin is primarily related to favorable pricing of $132 million, or 2.0% of net sales, gross productivity of $87 million, and favorable mix driven by the rationalization of unprofitable product lines primarily in the Rubbermaid Home Products business, partially offset by raw material inflation of $153 million (primarily resin and steel) and the impact of the core sales decline. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) for 2005 were 20.0% of net sales, or $1,265.6 million, versus 18.7%, or $1,208.8 million, for 2004. The increase in SGA reflects a currency impact of $11.0 million, a $9.0 million impact from the acquisition of DYMO and strategic investments in invest businesses, partially offset by streamlining in the Companys fix businesses. The Company recorded non cash pre tax impairment charges of $34.4 million and $295.1 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 charges were required to write down certain assets to fair value, including goodwill, trademarks and tradenames related to the Companys United Kingdom Home Fashions business. The 2004 charges were required to write down certain assets to fair value, primarily in the Companys European and Latin American Office Products businesses. See Footnote 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company recorded restructuring costs of $72.2 million and $44.2 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 restructuring costs included $51.3 million in non cash facility restructuring charges relating to Project Acceleration and $20.9 million relating to restructuring actions approved prior to the commencement of Project Acceleration. The $20.9 million of pre Project Acceleration costs included $7.7 million of facility and other exit costs, $11.4 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $1.8 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. The 2004 costs included $39.6 million of facility and other exit costs, $3.0 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $1.6 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. See Footnote 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the restructuring costs. Operating income for 2005 was $522.2 million, or 8.2% of net sales, versus $290.7 million, or 4.5% of net sales, in 2004. The improvement in operating margins is the result of the factors described above. Net nonoperating expenses for 2005 were 1.6% of net sales, or $104.1 million, versus 1.8% of net sales, or $116.1 million, for 2004. The decrease in net nonoperating expenses is mainly attributable to gains recognized in 2005 on the sale of property, plant and equipment and the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. This was partially offset by an increase in net interest expense, $127.1 million for 2005 compared to $119.3 million for 2004. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher borrowing rates, partially offset by lower average debt balances. See Footnote 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The effective tax rate was 14.8% for 2005 versus 59.6% for 2004. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the $73.9 million income tax benefit recorded in 2005 compared to the net income tax benefit of $15.5 million recorded in 2004, as a result of favorable resolution of certain tax positions and the expiration of the statute of limitations on other deductions. Additionally, the effective tax rate was impacted by the non deductibility associated with a portion of the Companys impairment charges recorded in 2005 and 2004 ($34.4 million and $295.1 million, respectively). See Footnotes 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In the second quarter of 2005, the Company committed to the disposal of a business in the Cleaning Organization segment and recognized impairment charge of $24.5 million, net of tax, in order to state the assets of this business at their estimated fair values. In the third and fourth quarters of 2005, the Company revised its estimation related to the fair value of this business after winning several line reviews with a key retailer and reversed the full amount of the impairment charge. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company changed its decision to dispose of this business 22 as a result of the aforementioned line review wins and the identification of significant productivity opportunities. The results of this business are reflected in continuing operations. Income from continuing operations for 2005 was $356.4 million, compared to $70.6 million for 2004. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.30 for 2005 compared to $0.26 for 2004. The loss from discontinued operations for 2005 was $105.1 million, compared to $186.7 million for 2004. For 2005, the loss on disposal of discontinued operations was $96.8 million, comprised primarily of a $62.0 million loss on the disposal of the Curver business and a $33.9 million loss related to the sale of the European Cookware business. For 2004, the Company recorded a $21.5 million loss on the disposal of the U.S. picture frames business (Burnes), the Anchor Hocking glassware business, and the Mirro cookware business, a $72.2 million loss on the disposal of the Panex Brazilian low end cookware division, and a $6.4 million loss, net of tax, on the disposal of the European picture frames business, partially offset by a gain on the disposal of the Little Tikes Commercial Playground Systems business of $9.6 million. Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations was $0.38 for 2005 compared to $0.68 for 2004. See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Net income (loss) for 2005 was $251.3 million, compared to ($116.1) million for 2004. Diluted earnings (loss) per share was $0.91 for 2005 compared to ($0.42) for 2004. Results of Operations 2004 vs. 2003 Net sales for 2004 were $6,479.8 million, representing a decrease of $135.0 million, or 2.0% from $6,614.8 million for 2003, consisting of the following (in millions, except percentages): $ % Favorable currency translation $134 2.0 % Unfavorable pricing (3 ) Product line rationalization (257 ) (3.9 ) Core sales decline (9 ) (0.1 ) ($135 ) (2.0 )% Net sales in the Companys invest businesses improved 1.0% in 2004 versus 2003 led by single digit growth in Tools Hardware and Rubbermaid Commercial Products. Net sales in the Companys fix businesses declined 6.0% in 2004 versus 2003, as a result of planned rationalization of low margin products in the Rubbermaid Home Products and Graco Childrens Products businesses. Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2004 was 28.4%, or $1,838.8 million, versus 28.5%, or $1,882.1 million, for 2003. The decline in gross margin is primarily related to raw material inflation of $116 million and unfavorable pricing of $3 million, partially offset by favorable mix driven by the rationalization of unprofitable product lines, primarily in the Rubbermaid Home Products business, gross productivity and other savings of $76 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) for 2004 were 18.7% of net sales, or $1,208.8 million, versus 17.5%, or $1,160.7 million, for 2003. The increase in SGA reflects a currency impact of $37 million and pension cost increases of $16 million. All other SGA was down $5 million, with strategic investments more than offset by streamlining in the Companys fix businesses. The Company recorded non cash impairment charges of $295.1 million and $34.5 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2004 charge was required to write down certain assets to fair value, primarily in the Companys European and Latin American Office Products businesses. The 2003 charge was required to write down certain assets to fair value, primarily in the Companys Cleaning Organization segment, resulting from the decision to exit certain product lines. See Footnote 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company recorded restructuring costs of $44.2 million and $189.3 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2004 costs included $39.6 million of facility and other exit costs, $3.0 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $1.6 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. The 2003 pre tax costs included $83.2 million of facility and other exit costs, $80.2 million of employee severance and 23 termination benefits and $25.9 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. See Footnote 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the restructuring costs. Operating income for 2004 was $290.7 million, or 4.5% of net sales, versus $497.6 million, or 7.5% of net sales, in 2003. The decline in operating margins is the result of the factors described above. Net nonoperating expenses for 2004 were 1.8% of net sales, or $116.1 million, versus 2.4% of net sales, or $159.9 million, for 2003. The decrease in net nonoperating expenses is attributable to a reduction in net interest expense of $15.0 million in 2004 ($119.3 million in 2004 compared to $134.3 million in 2003), as a result of lower average debt outstanding, partially offset by increased interest rates. Also, in 2003, the Company recognized a $30.4 million non cash loss on the sale of its Cosmolab and Photo Fashions businesses. See Footnote 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The effective tax rate was 59.6% for 2004 versus 35.5% for 2003. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the non deductibility associated with a portion of the Companys $295.1 million impairment charge in 2004, partially offset by the net income tax benefit of $15.5 million recorded in 2004, as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax positions and the expiration of the statute of limitations. See Footnotes 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Income from continuing operations for 2004 was $70.6 million, compared to $217.9 million for 2003. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.26 for 2004 compared to $0.79 for 2003. The loss from discontinued operations in 2004 was $186.7 million compared to $264.5 million in 2003. The loss from operations of discontinued operations for 2004 was $96.2 million, compared to $264.5 million for 2003. For 2003, the Company recorded a non cash pre tax write down of $254.9 million on certain businesses that it was evaluating for potential sale and were presented in discontinued operations. See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The loss on disposal of discontinued operations for 2004 was $90.5 million. In 2003, there were no disposals of business. In 2004, the Company recorded a $21.5 million loss on the disposal of the U.S. picture frames business (Burnes), Anchor Hocking glassware business, and Mirro cookware business, a $72.2 million loss on the disposal of the Panex Brazilian low end cookware division, a $6.4 million loss on the disposal of the European picture frames business, partially offset by a gain on the disposal of the Little Tikes Commercial Playground Systems business of $9.6 million. Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations was $0.68 for 2004 compared to $0.96 for 2003. See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Net loss for 2004 was $116.1 million, compared to $46.6 million for 2004. Diluted loss per share was $0.42 for 2004 compared to $0.17 for 2003. Business Segment Operating Results 2005 vs. 2004 Business Segment Operating Results Net sales by segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2005 2004 % Change Cleaning Organization $1,614.6 $1,702.7 (5.2 )% Office Products 1,713.3 1,686.2 1.6 Tools Hardware 1,260.3 1,218.7 3.4 Home Fashions 824.0 906.8 (9.1 ) Other 930.3 965.4 (3.6 ) Total Net Sales $6,342.5 $6,479.8 (2.1 )% Operating income by segment was as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2005 2004 % Change Cleaning Organization $116.9 $100.7 16.1 % Office Products 266.0 261.9 1.6 Tools Hardware 171.1 181.8 (5.9 ) 24 2005 2004 % Change Home Fashions 22.7 33.0 (31.2 ) Other 98.1 92.0 6.6 Corporate (46.0 ) (39.4 ) (16.8 ) Impairment charge (34.4 ) (295.1 ) Restructuring costs (72.2 ) (44.2 ) Total Operating Income $522.2 $290.7 79.6 % Cleaning Organization Net sales for 2005 were $1,614.6 million, a decrease of $88.1 million, or 5.2%, from $1,702.7 million in 2004, driven primarily by the planned product line exits and core sales declines in the Rubbermaid Home Products business. These factors were partially offset by increases in core product sales in the Rubbermaid Commercial Products business, favorable pricing and foreign currency translation. Operating income for 2005 was $116.9 million, an increase of $16.2 million, or 16.1%, from $100.7 million in 2004. The improvement in operating income is the result of core sales growth in Rubbermaid Commercial Products, favorable sales mix and favorable pricing which more than offset raw material inflation and lost absorption in manufacturing facilities. Office Products Net sales for 2005 were $1,713.3 million, an increase of $27.1 million, or 1.6% from $1,686.2 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of DYMO, the introduction of innovative new products in the markers business and favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by sales declines in the fine writing and the Eldon office products businesses. Operating income for 2005 was $266.0 million, an increase of $4.1 million, or 1.6%, from $261.9 million in 2004, as a result of the impact of the DYMO acquisition and improved margins associated with the new product introductions and productivity, partially offset by raw material inflation and increased investment in SGA, primarily related to advertising and promotion. Tools Hardware Net sales for 2005 were $1,260.3 million, an increase of $41.6 million, or 3.4%, from $1,218.7 million in 2004, driven by increases in the LENOX, and IRWIN branded businesses, partially offset by sales declines in the Amerock business and consumer electronic tools. Operating income for 2005 was $171.1 million, a decrease of $10.7 million, or 5.9%, from $181.8 million in 2004, driven by raw material inflation, restructuring related costs at the Amerock business and investments in SGA in the tools business, partially offset by productivity and the sales increase noted above. Home Fashions Net sales for 2005 were $824.0 million, a decrease of $82.8 million, or 9.1%, from $906.8 million in 2004, driven by product line exits and core sales declines in the European Home Fashions business, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation and increased sales in the North American Home Fashions business. Operating income for 2005 was $22.7 million, a decrease of $10.3 million, or 31.2%, from $33.0 million in 2004. The decrease in operating income was due primarily to lower sales, partially offset by productivity. Other Net sales for 2005 were $930.3 million, a decrease of $35.1 million, or 3.6%, from $965.4 million in 2004. The decline is primarily the result of core sales declines in the Little Tikes battery operated products business. 25 Operating income for 2005 was $98.1 million, an increase of $6.1 million, or 6.6%, from $92.0 million in the comparable period of 2004, driven by productivity, favorable pricing and reduced SGA in the juvenile products businesses, partially offset by raw material inflation. 2004 vs. 2003 Business Segment Operating Results Net sales by segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2004 2003 % Change Cleaning Organization $1,702.7 $1,848.6 (7.9 )% Office Products 1,686.2 1,681.2 0.3 Tools Hardware 1,218.7 1,199.7 1.6 Home Fashions 906.8 901.0 0.6 Other 965.4 984.3 (1.9 ) Total Net Sales $6,479.8 $6,614.8 (2.0 )% Operating income by segment was as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions): 2004 2003 % Change Cleaning Organization $100.7 $103.6 (2.8 )% Office Products 261.9 309.6 (15.4 ) Tools Hardware 181.8 179.3 1.4 Home Fashions 33.0 44.4 (25.7 ) Other 92.0 114.8 (19.9 ) Corporate (39.4 ) (30.3 ) (30.0 ) Impairment charges (295.1 ) (34.5 ) Restructuring costs (44.2 ) (189.3 ) Total Operating Income $290.7 $497.6 (41.6 )% Cleaning Organization Net sales for 2004 were $1,702.7 million, a decrease of $145.9 million, or 7.9%, from $1,848.6 million in 2003. The 7.9% sales decrease was driven primarily by a decline in the Rubbermaid Home Products business due to planned low margin product line rationalizations, partially offset by favorable pricing and increases in core product sales in the Rubbermaid Foodservice, Rubbermaid Commercial, and Rubbermaid Asia Pacific businesses. Operating income for 2004 was $100.7 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 2.8%, from $103.6 million in 2003. The decrease in operating income is primarily the result of higher raw material costs (particularly resin), partially offset by favorable pricing and improvement in Rubbermaid Commercial and Rubbermaid Asia Pacific businesses. Office Products Net sales for 2004 were $1,686.2 million, an increase of $5.0 million, or 0.3%, from $1,681.2 million in 2003. The increase in net sales primarily resulted from a single digit increase in the writing instruments business on the strength of innovative new products, largely offset by the exit of low margin resin based products in the Eldon office products business. Operating income for 2004 was $261.9 million, a decrease of $47.7 million, or 15.4%, from $309.6 million in 2003. The decrease in operating income was driven by restructuring related costs in the European writing instruments business and raw material inflation, primarily in resin costs in the Eldon office products division, partially offset by improvement in the Sanford Latin America and Sanford Asia Pacific businesses. Tools Hardware 26 Net sales for 2004 were $1,218.7 million, an increase of $19.0 million, or 1.6%, from $1,199.7 million in 2003. The increase in net sales was driven by increases in the LENOX businesses. Operating income for 2004 was $181.8 million, an increase of $2.5 million, or 1.4%, from $179.3 million in 2003. The improvement in operating income was generated primarily by productivity savings, sales increases and streamlining initiatives, partially offset by raw material inflation. Home Fashions Net sales for 2004 were $906.8 million, an increase of $5.8 million, or 0.6%, from $901.0 million in 2003. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by favorable foreign currency fluctuation, partially offset by planned product line exits in the Swish UK business. Operating income for 2004 was $33.0 million, a decrease of $11.4 million, or 25.7%, from $44.4 million in 2003. The decrease in operating income is primarily the result of raw material inflation and charges related to the liquidation of certain product lines in the segment. Other Net sales for 2004 were $965.4 million, a decrease of $18.9 million, or 1.9%, from $984.3 million in 2003. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to the sale of Cosmolab in March 2003, which contributed $10 million in sales in 2003, and sales declines experienced in the Graco business. Operating income for 2004 was $92.0 million, a decrease of $22.8 million, or 19.9%, from $114.8 million in 2003. The decrease in operating income was due primarily to the sales decrease at Graco and raw material inflation in resin based products. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents (decreased) increased as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Cash provided by operating activities $641.6 $660.0 $773.2 Cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (766.7 ) 189.6 (716.1 ) Cash (used in)/provided by financing activities (257.2 ) (494.1 ) 31.4 Exchange effect on cash and cash equivalents (7.8 ) 5.7 0.8 (Decrease) Increase in cash and cash equivalents ($390.1 ) $361.2 $89.3 Sources The Companys primary sources of liquidity and capital resources include cash provided by operations, proceeds from divestitures and use of available borrowing facilities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $641.6 million compared to $660.0 million for the comparable period of 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities before working capital changes decreased in 2005, which was partially offset by improvements in working capital. In 2005, the Company received cash proceeds of $65.5 million related to the sale of businesses and other non current assets, compared to $318.1 million in 2004. In 2005, the Company received cash proceeds of $64.3 million related to the sale of other non current assets, compared to $55.3 million in 2004. In 2005, the Company sold the Curver business. Businesses sold in 2004 include Panex Brazilian low end cookware, European picture frames, U.S. picture frames (Burnes), Anchor Hocking glassware, Mirro cookware and Little Tikes Commercial Playground Systems. 27 In 2005, the Company received proceeds from the issuance of debt of $337.0 million compared to $33.9 million in 2004. Most of the increase in 2005 was due to the issuance of commercial paper related to the funding of the November 2005 DYMO acquisition. The Company has short term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that are available for short term financing. Borrowings under the Companys uncommitted lines of credit are subject to the discretion of the lender. The Companys lines of credit do not have a material impact on the Companys liquidity. Borrowings under the Companys lines of credit at December 31, 2005 and 2004 totaled $4.0 million and $21.3 million, respectively. In November 2005, the Company entered into a $750.0 million syndicated revolving credit facility (the Revolver) pursuant to a five year credit agreement. The Revolver, which expires in November 2010, replaces the Companys $650.0 million five year Syndicated Revolving Credit Agreement that was scheduled to expire in June 2007. At December 31, 2005, there were no borrowings under the Revolver. In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may issue up to $750.0 million of commercial paper. The Revolver provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. The Revolver also provides for the issuance of up to $100.0 million of standby letters of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. At December 31, 2005, $202.0 million of commercial paper was outstanding and there were no standby letters of credit issued under the Revolver. The Revolver permits the Company to borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms and requires, among other things, that the Company maintain certain Interest Coverage and Total Indebtedness to Total Capital Ratio, as defined in the agreement. The Revolver also limits Subsidiary Indebtedness. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with the agreement governing the Revolver. On an annual basis, the Company may request extension of the Revolver (subject to lender approval) for additional one year periods. Under a 2001 receivables facility with a financial institution, the Company created a financing entity that is consolidated in the Companys financial statements. Under this facility, the Company regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity to sell an undivided interest in substantially all of the Companys United States trade receivables to the financing entity. In 2001, the financing entity issued $450.0 million in preferred debt securities to the financial institution. Certain levels of accounts receivable write offs and other events would permit the financial institution to terminate the receivables facility and require redemption of the preferred debt securities. The receivables and preferred debt securities are recorded in the consolidated accounts of the Company. The financing entity may cause the preferred debt securities to be exchanged on September 18, 2006 for a two year floating rate note in an aggregate principal amount equal to the par value of the preferred debt securities plus accrued but unpaid return. Upon the exchange, the financing entity will pay to the preferred debt securities holder, a premium for which the Company has accrued $4.6 million as of December 31, 2005. Because this debt matures in 2008, the entire amount is considered to be long term debt. At any time prior to maturity of the note, the holder may elect to convert it into new preferred debt securities of the financing company with a par value equal to the outstanding principal amount of the note. The preferred debt securities must be retired or redeemed, and any note for which such securities are exchanged must be repaid, before the Company can have access to the financing entitys receivables. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the aggregate amount of outstanding receivables sold under this facility was $746.9 million and $720.9 million, respectively. Uses The Companys primary uses of liquidity and capital resources include acquisitions, dividend payments, capital expenditures and payments on debt. Cash used for acquisitions was $740.0 million in 2005, compared to $6.6 million in 2004. The cash used in 2005 related primarily to the acquisition of DYMO for $706 million, which was funded by approximately $487 million of cash on hand and $219 million from existing credit facilities. See Footnote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2004, the Company did not invest in significant acquisitions. 28 Capital expenditures were $92.2 million and $121.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to the Companys focus on capital spending discipline in 2005. Capital expenditures for 2006 are expected to be in the range of $125 to $150 million. In 2005, the Company made payments on notes payable and long term debt of $360.1 million compared to $298.4 million in 2004, including the purchases in 2005 of 750,000 shares of its 5.25% convertible preferred securities from holders at an average price of $47.075 per share ($35.3 million). In 2004, the Company purchased 825,000 shares of its 5.25% convertible preferred securities from a holder for $43.6875 per share ($36.0 million). See Footnote 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions. Aggregate dividends paid were $231.5 million and $231.0 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006, the Company expects to make similar dividend payments. Cash used for restructuring activities was $35.5 million and $79.7 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. These payments relate primarily to employee termination benefits. In 2006, the Company expects to use approximately $100 million of cash on restructuring activities related to Project Acceleration. See Footnote 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2005, the Company made a voluntary $25.0 million cash contribution to fund its foreign pension plans. In 2004, the Company made a voluntary $50.0 million cash contribution to fund the Companys U.S. pension plan. In 2005, the Company terminated a cross currency interest rate swap and paid $26.9 million. This payment has been recognized in operating cash flow. In 2004, the Company recognized $5.5 million related to the fair value of an interest rate swap that was terminated as a source in operating cash flow. Retained earnings increased in 2005 by $19.7 million. The increase in retained earnings is due to the current year net income, partially offset by cash dividends paid on common stock. Working capital at December 31, 2005 was $675.3 million compared to $1,141.1 million at December 31, 2004. The current ratio at December 31, 2005 was 1.38:1 compared to 1.61:1 at December 31, 2004. The decrease in working capital is due to cash used to fund the DYMO acquisition, partially offset by favorable tax settlements and the reduction of other accrued liabilities, primarily as a result of spending on previously announced restructuring plans. Total debt to total capitalization (total debt is net of cash and cash equivalents, and total capitalization includes total debt and stockholders equity) was .60:1 at December 31, 2005 and .55:1 at December 31, 2004. The Company believes that cash provided from operations and available borrowing facilities will continue to provide adequate support for the cash needs of existing businesses on a short term basis; however, certain events, such as significant acquisitions, could require additional external financing on a long term basis. Minimum Pension Liability In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded an additional minimum pension liability adjustment at December 31, 2005. The effect of this non cash adjustment was to increase the pension liability by approximately $89.1 million, with a corresponding charge to equity, net of taxes, of approximately $60 million. The Company believes that its pension plan has the appropriate long term investment strategy and the Companys liquidity position is expected to remain strong. Resolution of Income Tax Contingencies In 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded $73.9 million and $15.5 million, respectively, in income tax benefit as a result of favorable resolution of certain tax issues and the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax issues. These benefits are reflected in the Companys 2005 and 2004 Consolidated Statements of Operations. 29 Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in its consolidated financial statements. Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of December 31, 2005 and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements. The following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations listed below are expected to have on the Companys cash flow in the indicated period. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2005. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as referenced in the table (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt maturities (1) $2,592.5 $162.8 $705.4 $706.3 $1,018.0 Interest on long term debt (2) 1,323.7 145.8 230.8 163.8 783.3 Operating lease obligations (3) 290.9 90.4 103.1 50.8 46.6 Purchase obligations (4) 600.0 407.7 191.8 0.4 0.1 Total contractual obligations (5) $4,807.1 $806.7 $1,231.1 $921.3 $1,848.0 (1) Amounts represent contractual obligations due, excluding interest, based on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2005. For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnotes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Amounts represent estimated interest expense on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2005. Interest on floating debt was estimated using the index rate in effect as of December 31, 2005. For further information relating to this obligation, see Footnotes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Amounts represent contractual minimum lease obligations on operating leases as of December 31, 2005. For further information relating to this obligation, see Footnote 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Primarily consists of purchase commitments entered into as of December 31, 2005 for finished goods, raw materials, components and services pursuant to legally enforceable and binding obligations, which include all significant terms. (5) Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2005 balance sheet as current liabilities, except for current portion of long term debt. The Company also has obligations with respect to its pension and post retirement medical benefit plans. See Footnote 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $96.7 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Companys self insurance programs, including workers compensation, product liability, and medical. See Footnote 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2005, the Company did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Critical Accounting Policies The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections describe the Companys critical accounting policies. 30 Sales Recognition Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership change, which occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms. Sales is net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other sales related discounts. Recovery of Accounts Receivable The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. When aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Companys estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had allowances for doubtful accounts of $31.8 million on $1,234.5 million of accounts receivable. Inventory Reserves The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets The Company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its annual strategic planning process for all of its businesses. The Company also tests for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the indefinite life intangible asset is below its carrying amount. The Company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the Companys customer base, or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers. The Company assesses the fair value of its reporting units for its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks and tradenames) in its impairment tests, generally based upon a discounted cash flow methodology, or an actual sales offer received from a prospective buyer, if available. The discounted cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses, working capital, terminal value, and market discount rates. The underlying assumptions used are consistent with those used in the strategic plan. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value, goodwill impairment may be present. The Company measures the goodwill impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recorded intangible asset exceeds the fair value. Other Long Lived Assets The Company tests its other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. In accordance with 31 SFAS No. 144, the Company evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment and other long lived assets are present. These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group. If impairment indicators are present, the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount. The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses, working capital, and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the strategic plan. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a risk free discount rate and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the product line level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available. Product Liability Reserves The Company has a self insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance. The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves. The Companys actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the Companys product liability reserve. The Company has product liability reserves of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2005. While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company and such additional losses may be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Environmental Reserves The Company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as, contract and other disputes. The Company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based largely on historical experience. The estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts, including legal fees, where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. No insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the Companys cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Companys cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to long term operations and maintenance CERCLA matters which are estimated at present value. The Companys estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of December 31, 2005 ranged between $12.8 million and $23.8 million. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had a reserve equal to $15.4 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate, which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income Tax Contingencies The Company establishes a tax contingency reserve for certain tax exposures when it is not probable that the Companys tax position will be ultimately sustained. The Company eliminates a tax contingency reserve balance when it becomes probable that the Companys tax position will ultimately be sustained, which generally occurs when the statute of limitations for a specific exposure item has expired or when the Company has reached agreement with the taxing authorities on the treatment of an item. The Company generally assesses its tax contingency reserves on a quarterly basis. Management cannot determine with certainty the ultimate resolution of these tax matters. Actual results may differ from the recorded amounts. Pending Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements Stock Options 32 In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised) (SFAS 123(R)), Share Based Payment. SFAS 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values (i.e., pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition). The Statement supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and will require adoption no later than January 1, 2006. The Company has adopted the provisions of the new standard using the modified prospective method and using the Black Scholes option pricing model effective January 1, 2006. As a result of adoption, the Company expects to recognize approximately $15 million to $20 million, pre tax, in additional expense in 2006. International Operations For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Companys non U.S. businesses accounted for approximately 28%, 29% and 28% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Changes in both U.S. and non U.S. net sales are shown below for the years ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2005 vs. 2004 vs. 2004 % 2003 % 2005 2004 2003 Change Change U.S. $4,537.1 $4,611.1 $4,787.1 (1.6 )% (3.7 )% Non U.S 1,805.4 1,868.7 1,827.7 (3.4 ) 2.2 $6,342.5 $6,479.8 $6,614.8 (2.1 )% (2.0 )% Forward Looking Statements Certain statements in this report and the documents incorporated herein by reference constitute forward looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. The statements relate to, and other forward looking statements that may be made by the Company may relate to, but are not limited to, information or assumptions about the effects of Project Acceleration, sales (including pricing), income/(loss), earnings per share, return on equity, return on invested capital, capital expenditures, working capital, cash flow, dividends, capital structure, debt to capitalization ratios, interest rates, internal growth rates, restructuring, impairment and other charges, potential losses on divestitures, impact of changes in accounting standards, pending legal proceedings and claims (including environmental matters), future economic performance, operating income improvements, costs and cost savings (including raw material inflation, productivity and streamlining), synergies, managements plans, goals and objectives for future operations and growth. These statements generally are accompanied by words such as intend, anticipate, believe, estimate, project, target, plan, expect, will, should or similar statements. You should understand that forward looking statements are not guarantees because there are inherent difficulties in predicting future results. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. The factors that are discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this report, as well as the matters that are set forth generally in this report and the documents incorporated by reference herein, could cause actual results to differ. Some of these factors are described as criteria for success. Our failure to achieve, or limited success in achieving, these objectives could result in actual results differing materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. In addition, there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and assessed all of the factors affecting the Company or that the publicly available and other information we receive with respect to these factors is complete or correct. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The Companys market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices. Pursuant to the Companys policies, natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. 33 The Company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions, and, for qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense. The Companys foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less. The Company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form: 1) offsetting or netting of like foreign currency flows, 2) structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk, 3) converting excess foreign currency deposits into U.S. dollars or the relevant functional currency and 4) avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency. In addition, the Company utilizes forward contracts and purchased options to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions. Derivatives used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company purchases certain raw materials, including resin, corrugate, steel and aluminum, which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors. While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, a variety of programs, including periodic raw material purchases, purchases of raw materials for future delivery, long term contracts and price adjustments help the Company mitigate this risk. Where practical, the Company uses derivatives to help manage the volatility related to this risk. In 2005, the Company experienced raw material inflation of approximately $153 million (primarily in resin and steel), partially offset by pricing increases of approximately $132 million. The amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the Company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model. The value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variance/covariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures (specifically excluding equity method investments). The fair value losses shown in the table below have no impact on results of operations or financial condition, but are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest rates. The following table indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (in millions, except percentages): 2005 December 31, 2004 December 31, Confidence Market Risk Average 2005 Average 2004 Level Interest rates $9.5 $8.1 $12.1 $11.3 95 % Foreign exchange $3.1 $5.6 $ 2.2 $ 1.9 95 % The 95% confidence interval signifies the Companys degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the Companys favor. The value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse. Actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is highly unlikely that the Company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. 34
