ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Executive Overview Newell Rubbermaid is a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that touch the lives of people where they work, live and play. The Companys multi product offering consists of well known name brand consumer and commercial products in four business segments as follows: Segment Description of Products Cleaning, Organization Dcor Material handling, cleaning, refuse, indoor/outdoor organization, home storage, food storage, drapery hardware, window treatments Office Products Ball point/roller ball pens, markers, highlighters, pencils, correction fluids, office products, art supplies, on demand labeling products, card scanning solutions Tools Hardware Hand tools, power tool accessories, manual paint applicators, cabinet, window and convenience hardware, propane torches, solder Home Family (Other) Operating segments that do not meet aggregation criteria with other operating segments, including premium cookware and related kitchenware, hair care accessory products, infant and juvenile products, including high chairs, car seats, strollers and play yards The Companys vision is to become a global company of Brands That MatterTM and great people, known for best in class results. The Company remains committed to investing in strategic brands and new product development, 19 Table of Contents strengthening its portfolio of businesses, reducing its supply chain costs and streamlining non strategic selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA). In 2006, the Company began transforming into a consumer driven branding company embracing consumer pull marketing, with meaningful new product innovation fueled by consumer insight, concept development and validation. The Company assessed its top 16 brands using a uniform methodology, and fielded incremental consumer and brand research to fill in knowledge gaps and verify our hypotheses regarding segmentation, consumer targeting and brand equity. In 2007, we expect to continue this transformation; developing formalized training and development programs to help foster the skills and talents necessary to achieve best in class consumer branding capability and building the increasing consumer understanding into our innovation and business planning processes. In 2006, we increased our investment in consumer understanding, innovation and demand creation (Strategic Brand Building) to 5.5% of sales, a 40% increase from 2005. The Company plans to continue making investments in these strategic brand building activities. During 2006, the Company continued to make progress on strengthening its portfolio. The Company completed the integration of its acquisition of DYMO and substantially completed the sales of its European Cookware, Little Tikes and Home Dcor Europe businesses. Another key initiative of the Company is to restructure its manufacturing and sourcing network to increase capacity utilization, increase the percentage of manufacturing located in low cost countries, and achieve the desired balance of company owned manufacturing and third party sourcing partners. Project Acceleration remains on schedule. To date, the Company has announced approximately two thirds of the anticipated closings or consolidations, and projects annualized savings exceeding $150 million upon the completion of the program in 2009. The key tenets of the Companys strategy include building large, consumer meaningful brands (Brands That MatterTM), leveraging one Newell Rubbermaid, achieving a best total cost position and commercializing innovation across the enterprise. The Companys results depend on the ability of its individual business units to succeed in their respective categories, each of which has some unique consumers, customers and competitors. The Companys strategic initiatives are designed to help enable these business units to generate differentiated products, operate within a best in class cost structure and employ superior branding in order to yield premium margins on their products. Premium margins fund incremental demand creation by the business units, driving incremental sales and profits for the Company. The Companys emphasis in 2007 will be to deliver sales growth and gross margin expansion through increased investments in consumer understanding, innovation and demand creation activities. The Company will focus on developing best in class practices for these activities. The Companys objective is to build brands that really matter to its consumers. The Company will put in the systems to understand its consumers in detail how they use its products, what they value, and how to delight them and or excite them. The Company will invest in more innovation that differentiates its products. The Company will invest more in advertising and other consumer marketing to increase awareness as well as trial and repeat purchases to enhance the brands. Further, the Company will measure the effectiveness of those increased strategic brand building investments. The Company is making the necessary investments now for the long term success of its business. In 2007, the Company expects SGA to increase due to continued investment in strategic brand building initiatives and other long term initiatives including the SAP implementation, co location strategies, expanded shared services in Europe and the U.S., and building organizational capability through training and development. The following section details the Companys performance in each of its transformational initiatives: Create Consumer Meaningful Brands The Company is moving from its historical focus on push marketing and excellence in manufacturing and distributing products, to a new focus on consumer pull marketing, creating competitive advantage through better understanding our consumers, innovating to deliver great performance, investing in advertising and promotion to create demand and leveraging our brands in adjacent categories around the world. Consumer meaningful brands create more value than products alone, and big brands provide the Company with the economies of scale that can be leveraged in todays marketplace. In 2006, the Company made incremental investments in strategic brand building, particularly on Calphalon, Graco, Goody, LENOX , IRWIN, Sharpie and DYMO, increasing the 20 Table of Contents investment in strategic SGA from approximately 4.0% of sales in 2005 to 5.5% of sales in 2006. The Company also initiated a consulting and training partnership with one of the largest worldwide creative and media agencies. The objective is to create best in class branding capabilities across the Company. The first step was to understand the brand vitality of the Companys 16 largest brands using a common set of metrics. The Company will then integrate this understanding into its ongoing processes for product innovation, competitive analysis, strategic planning and brand marketing. Leverage One Newell Rubbermaid The Company is committed to leveraging the common business activities and best practices of our business units, and to build one common culture of shared values, with a focus on collaboration and teamwork. The Company is exploring ways to leverage common functional capabilities such as Human Resources, Information Technology, Customer Service, Supply Chain and Finance to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This broad reaching initiative already includes projects such as the corporate consolidation of the distribution and transportation function, and aggregating Company wide purchasing efforts including both direct and indirect materials and services. During the past year, the Company also streamlined the structure of its Tools Hardware segment to create a more effective organization and leverage scale efficiencies. The Company also accelerated the process of creating shared services for the European businesses and is evaluating expanding the scope of shared services in the United States. The transition of services to the Shared Service Center in Europe is approximately two thirds complete. In addition, the Company has recently created leadership positions Vice President of Program Management and President of Newell Rubbermaid Europe, Middle East and Africa to identify and drive synergies across business units. Finally, the Company is in the early stages of migrating multiple legacy systems and users to a common SAP global information platform, which we expect will enable the Company to integrate and manage its worldwide business and reporting process more efficiently. Phase one implementation is currently planned for the North American Office Products business in late 2007. The total company implementation will occur over several years in phases that are primarily based on geographic region and segment. Achieve Best Total Cost The Companys objective is to reduce the cost of manufacturing, sourcing and supplying product on an ongoing basis, and to leverage the Companys size and scale, in order to achieve a best total cost position. Achieving best cost positions in its categories allows the Company to increase investment in strategic brand building initiatives. Through Newell Operational Excellence and previous restructuring, the Company has made significant progress in reducing its supply chain costs and delivering productivity savings. Project Acceleration includes the closure of approximately one third of the Companys 64 manufacturing facilities (as of December 31, 2005, adjusted for the divestiture of Little Tikes and Home Dcor Europe), optimizing the Companys geographic manufacturing footprint. Since the inception of Project Acceleration, the Company has announced the closure of 14 manufacturing facilities. Project Acceleration is projected to result in cumulative restructuring costs of approximately $375 to $400 million ($315 million $340 million after tax). Approximately 60% of the costs are expected to be cash. Annualized savings are now projected to exceed $150 million upon conclusion of the program in 2009. In 2006, the Company also broadened its supply chain efforts to include the realization of efficiencies in purchasing and distribution transportation. Finally, the Company has shifted a portion of its research and development focus to designing lower cost into future product initiatives. Nurture 360 Innovation The Company has broadened its definition of innovation beyond product invention. The Company will define innovation as the successful commercialization of invention. Innovation must be more than product development. It is a rigorous, consumer centric process that permeates the entire development cycle. It begins with a deep understanding of how consumers interact with the Companys brands and categories, and all the factors that drive their purchase decisions and in use experience. That understanding must then be translated into innovative products that deliver unique features and benefits, at a best cost position, providing the consumer with great value. Lastly, innovating how and where to create awareness and trial, and measuring the effectiveness of advertising and promotion spending, completes the process. The Company has pockets of excellence using this expanded definition of innovation, and it will continue to build on this competency. 21 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations The following table sets forth for the periods indicated items from the Consolidated Statements of Operations as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $ 6,201.0 100.0 % $ 5,717.2 100.0 % $ 5,707.1 100.0 % Cost of products sold 4,131.0 66.6 3,959.1 69.2 4,050.6 71.0 Gross margin 2,070.0 33.4 1,758.1 30.8 1,656.5 29.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) 1,347.0 21.7 1,117.7 19.5 1,050.1 18.4 Impairment charges 0.4 264.0 4.6 Restructuring costs 66.4 1.1 72.6 1.3 28.2 0.5 Operating income 656.6 10.6 567.4 9.9 314.2 5.5 Nonoperating expenses: Interest expense, net 132.0 2.1 127.1 2.2 119.3 2.1 Other expense (income), net 9.7 0.2 (23.1 ) (0.4 ) (3.0 ) (0.1 ) Net nonoperating expenses 141.7 2.3 104.0 1.8 116.3 2.0 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 514.9 8.3 463.4 8.1 197.9 3.5 Income taxes 44.2 0.7 57.1 1.0 92.9 1.6 Income from continuing operations 470.7 7.6 406.3 7.1 105.0 1.8 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (85.7 ) (1.4 ) (155.0 ) (2.7 ) (221.1 ) (3.9 ) Net income (loss) $385.0 6.2 % $251.3 4.4 % ($116.1 ) (2.0 )% Results of Operations 2006 vs. 2005 Net sales for 2006 were $6,201.0 million, representing an increase of $483.8 million, or 8.5% from $5,717.2 million for 2005. Excluding sales related to the DYMO acquisition, sales were up approximately $268 million, or 4.7%, driven by core sales growth of approximately 2.6%. The impact of positive currency translation and continued favorable pricing contributed approximately two points of additional improvement. Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2006 was 33.4%, or $2,070.0 million, versus 30.8%, or $1,758.1 million, for 2005. The 260 basis point improvement in gross margin was driven by productivity, favorable pricing, and favorable mix, which more than offset the impact of raw material inflation. SGA expenses for 2006 were 21.7% of net sales, or $1,347.0 million, versus 19.5%, or $1,117.7 million, for 2005. Approximately 40% of the increase is related to the impact of acquisitions, 40% represented increased investment in strategic brand building, and the remainder resulted from the impact of foreign currency and stock option accounting and the pension curtailment benefit recognized in 2005 that did not repeat in 2006. The Company recorded non cash pre tax impairment charges of $0.4 million for 2005 to write down certain trademarks and tradenames to fair value. See Footnote 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company recorded restructuring costs of $66.4 million and $72.6 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company has announced the closure of 14 manufacturing facilities since Project Accelerations inception. The Company expects cumulative pre tax costs of $375 to $400 million, approximately 60% of which are expected to be cash costs, over the life of the initiative. Annualized savings are projected to exceed $150 million upon completion of the project with an approximately $50 million benefit projected in 2007, $70 million benefit projected in 2008 and the remainder in 2009. The 2006 restructuring costs included $14.9 million of facility and other exit costs, $44.7 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $6.8 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. The 2005 restructuring costs included $51.3 million in non cash facility restructuring costs relating to Project Acceleration and $21.3 million relating to restructuring actions approved prior to the commencement of Project Acceleration. The $21.3 million of pre Project Acceleration costs included $7.9 million of facility and other exit costs, $11.1 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $2.3 million of 22 Table of Contents exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. See Footnote 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the restructuring costs. Operating income for 2006 was $656.6 million, or 10.6% of net sales, versus $567.4 million, or 9.9% of net sales, in 2005. The improvement in operating margins is the result of the factors described above. Net nonoperating expenses for 2006 were 2.3% of net sales, or $141.7 million, versus 1.8% of net sales, or $104.0 million, for 2005. The increase in net nonoperating expenses is mainly attributable to gains recognized in 2005 on the sale of property, plant and equipment and the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary that did not repeat in 2006, along with an increase in net interest expense, $132.0 million for 2006 compared to $127.1 million for 2005. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher borrowing rates and higher average debt balances. See Footnote 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The effective tax rate was 8.6% for 2006 versus 12.3% for 2005. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the $102.8 million income tax benefit recorded in 2006 compared to the net income tax benefit of $73.9 million recorded in 2005, as a result of favorable resolution of certain tax positions and the expiration of the statute of limitations on other deductions. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Income from continuing operations for 2006 was $470.7 million, compared to $406.3 million for 2005. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.71 for 2006 compared to $1.48 for 2005. The loss from discontinued operations for 2006 was $85.7 million, compared to $155.0 million for 2005. The gain (loss) on the disposal of discontinued operations for 2006 was $0.7 million, compared to $(96.8) million for 2005. The 2006 gain was primarily related to the disposal of the Little Tikes business, which was partially offset by the loss recognized on disposal of the Home Dcor Europe business. The 2005 loss related primarily to the disposal of the Curver and the European Cookware businesses. The loss from operations of discontinued operations for 2006 was $86.4 million, net of tax, compared to $58.2 million, net of tax, for 2005. Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations was $0.31 for 2006 compared to $0.56 for 2005. See Footnote 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Net income for 2006 was $385.0 million, compared to $251.3 million for 2005. Diluted earnings per share was $1.40 for 2006 compared to $0.91 for 2005. Results of Operations 2005 vs. 2004 Net sales for 2005 were $5,717.2 million, representing a increase of $10.1 million, or 0.2% from $5,707.1 million for 2004. Excluding sales related to the DYMO acquisition, sales decreased by $14.8 million primarily due to the rationalization of unfavorable product lines and core sales decline partially offset by favorable pricing. Positive currency translation improved sales by 0.7% for the full year. Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2005 was 30.8%, or $1,758.1 million, versus 29.0%, or $1,656.5 million, for 2004. The improvement in gross margin is primarily related to favorable pricing, productivity, and favorable mix driven by the rationalization of unprofitable product lines primarily in the Rubbermaid Home Products business, partially offset by raw material inflation (primarily resin and steel). SGA expenses for 2005 were 19.5% of net sales, or $1,117.7 million, versus 18.4%, or $1,050.1 million, for 2004. The increase in SGA was driven by the impact from foreign currency, the impact from the acquisition of DYMO and increased investments in strategic brand building, partially offset by streamlining. The Company recorded non cash pre tax impairment charges of $0.4 million and $264.0 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 charges were required to write down certain trademarks and tradename assets to fair value. The 2004 charges were required to write down certain assets to fair value, primarily in the Companys European and Latin American Office Products businesses. See Footnote 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company recorded restructuring costs of $72.6 million and $28.2 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 restructuring costs included $51.3 million in non cash facility restructuring costs relating to Project 23 Table of Contents Acceleration and $21.3 million relating to restructuring actions approved prior to the commencement of Project Acceleration. The $21.3 million of pre Project Acceleration costs included $7.9 million of facility and other exit costs, $11.1 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $2.3 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. The 2004 costs included $24.8 million of facility and other exit costs, $5.2 million of employee severance and termination benefits and the reversal of $1.8 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. See Footnote 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the restructuring costs. Operating income for 2005 was $567.4 million, or 9.9% of net sales, versus $314.2 million, or 5.5% of net sales, in 2004. The improvement in operating margins is the result of the factors described above. Net nonoperating expenses for 2005 were 1.8% of net sales, or $104.0 million, versus 2.0% of net sales, or $116.3 million, for 2004. The decrease in net nonoperating expenses is mainly attributable to gains recognized in 2005 on the sale of property, plant and equipment and the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. This was partially offset by an increase in net interest expense, $127.1 million for 2005 compared to $119.3 million for 2004. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher borrowing rates, partially offset by lower average debt balances. See Footnote 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The effective tax rate was 12.3% for 2005 versus 46.9% for 2004. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the $73.9 million income tax benefit recorded in 2005 compared to the net income tax benefit of $15.5 million recorded in 2004, as a result of favorable resolution of certain tax positions and the expiration of the statute of limitations on other deductions. Additionally, the effective tax rate was impacted by the non deductibility associated with a portion of the Companys impairment charges recorded in 2005 and 2004 ($0.4 million and $264.0 million, respectively). See Footnotes 16 and 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Income from continuing operations for 2005 was $406.3 million, compared to $105.0 million for 2004. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.48 for 2005 compared to $0.38 for 2004. The loss from discontinued operations for 2005 was $155.0 million, compared to $221.1 million for 2004. For 2005, the loss on disposal of discontinued operations was $96.8 million, comprised primarily of a $62.0 million loss on the disposal of the Curver business and a $33.9 million loss related to the sale of the European Cookware business. For 2004, the Company recorded a $21.5 million loss on the disposal of the U.S. picture frames business (Burnes), the Anchor Hocking glassware business, and the Mirro cookware business, a $72.2 million loss on the disposal of the Panex Brazilian low end cookware division, and a $6.4 million loss, net of tax, on the disposal of the European picture frames business, partially offset by a gain on the disposal of the Little Tikes Commercial Playground Systems business of $9.6 million. The loss from operations of discontinued operations for 2005 was $58.2 million, net of tax, compared to $130.6 million, net of tax, for 2004. Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations was $0.56 for 2005 compared to $0.80 for 2004. See Footnote 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Net income (loss) for 2005 was $251.3 million, compared to $(116.1) million for 2004. Diluted earnings (loss) per share was $0.91 for 2005 compared to $(0.42) for 2004. Business Segment Operating Results 2006 vs. 2005 Business Segment Operating Results Net sales by segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2006 2005 % Change Cleaning, Organization Dcor $ 1,995.7 $ 1,921.0 3.9 % Office Products 2,031.6 1,713.3 18.6 Tools Hardware 1,262.2 1,260.3 0.2 Home Family 911.5 822.6 10.8 Total Net Sales $ 6,201.0 $ 5,717.2 8.5 % 24 Table of Contents Operating income by segment was as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2006 2005 % Change Cleaning, Organization Dcor $ 209.1 $ 145.8 43.4 % Office Products 287.0 266.0 7.9 Tools Hardware 185.0 171.1 8.1 Home Family 117.9 103.5 13.9 Corporate (76.0 ) (46.0 ) 65.2 Impairment charge (0.4 ) Restructuring costs (66.4 ) (72.6 ) Total Operating Income $ 656.6 $ 567.4 15.7 % Cleaning, Organization Dcor Net sales for 2006 were $1,995.7 million, an increase of $74.7 million, or 3.9%, from $1,921.0 million in 2005, driven by mid single digit growth in Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Rubbermaid Home Products. New product innovation, a strong back to campus season, a successful year in insulated products and strong sales in the size in store and custom blind products drove the sales improvement. Partially offsetting this increase were low margin product line exits, specifically related to basic drapery hardware. Operating income for 2006 was $209.1 million, an increase of $63.3 million, or 43.4%, from $145.8 million in 2005. The increase in operating income was driven by the sales volume increases described above coupled with productivity initiatives and pricing actions put in place to offset raw material inflation. Office Products Net sales for 2006 were $2,031.6 million, an increase of $318.3 million, or 18.6% from $1,713.3 million in 2005. Excluding sales related to the DYMO acquisition, sales increased approximately 6%, led by strong performance in the Everyday Writing and Marker businesses. Operating income for 2006 was $287.0 million, an increase of $21.0 million, or 7.9%, from $266.0 million in 2005. Additional income from the DYMO acquisition and the sales volume increase described above were partially offset by strategic brand building spending, restructuring related inefficiencies and acquisition related start up costs. Tools Hardware Net sales for 2006 were $1,262.2 million, an increase of $1.9 million, or 0.2%, from $1,260.3 million in 2005, as mid single digit growth in our IRWIN and LENOX branded tools businesses was offset by the decline in our consumer electronic tools business. The consumer electronic tools product line has neared the end of its life cycle. Sales of other product lines increased approximately 3% in the segment, despite the challenging housing and retail environment. Operating income for 2006 was $185.0 million, an increase of $13.9 million, or 8.1%, from $171.1 million in 2005. Productivity initiatives were partially offset by strategic brand building investment and raw material inflation, particularly in aluminum, zinc and brass. Home Family Net sales for 2006 were $911.5 million, an increase of $88.9 million, or 10.8%, from $822.6 million in 2005. Broad based success in all three business units was fueled by sales of new products and consumer demand driven by targeted strategic SGA investment. Operating income for 2006 was $117.9 million, an increase of $14.4 million, or 13.9%, from $103.5 million in the comparable period of 2005, driven by an increase in sales and productivity, partially offset by increased SGA investment. 25 Table of Contents 2005 vs. 2004 Business Segment Operating Results Net sales by segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2005 2004 % Change Cleaning, Organization Dcor $ 1,921.0 $ 1,993.4 (3.6 )% Office Products 1,713.3 1,686.2 1.6 Tools Hardware 1,260.3 1,218.7 3.4 Home Family 822.6 808.8 1.7 Total Net Sales $ 5,717.2 $ 5,707.1 0.2 % Operating income by segment was as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2005 2004 % Change Cleaning, Organization Dcor $ 145.8 $113.6 28.3 % Office Products 266.0 262.0 1.5 Tools Hardware 171.1 181.7 (5.8 ) Home Family 103.5 88.4 17.1 Corporate (46.0 ) (39.3 ) 17.0 Impairment charge (0.4 ) (264.0 ) Restructuring costs (72.6 ) (28.2 ) Total Operating Income $ 567.4 $314.2 80.6 % Cleaning, Organization Dcor Net sales for 2005 were $1,921.0 million, a decrease of $72.4 million, or 3.6%, from $1,993.4 million in 2004, driven primarily by planned product line exits and core sales declines in the Rubbermaid Home Products business. These factors were partially offset by increases in core product sales in the Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Levolor/Kirsch businesses, and favorable pricing. Operating income for 2005 was $145.8 million, an increase of $32.2 million, or 28.3%, from $113.6 million in 2004. The improvement in operating income is the result of core sales growth in Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Levolor/Kirsch, reduced restructuring activity, favorable sales mix and favorable pricing which more than offset raw material inflation and lost absorption in manufacturing facilities. Office Products Net sales for 2005 were $1,713.3 million, an increase of $27.1 million, or 1.6% from $1,686.2 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of DYMO, the introduction of innovative new products in the markers business and favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by sales declines in the fine writing and the Eldon office products businesses. Operating income for 2005 was $266.0 million, an increase of $4.0 million, or 1.5%, from $262.0 million in 2004, as a result of the impact of the DYMO acquisition and improved margins associated with the new product introductions and productivity, partially offset by raw material inflation and increased investment in SGA, primarily related to advertising and promotion. Tools Hardware Net sales for 2005 were $1,260.3 million, an increase of $41.6 million, or 3.4%, from $1,218.7 million in 2004, driven by increases in the LENOX, and IRWIN branded businesses, partially offset by sales declines in the Amerock business and consumer electronic tools. 26 Table of Contents Operating income for 2005 was $171.1 million, a decrease of $10.6 million, or 5.8%, from $181.7 million in 2004, driven by raw material inflation, restructuring related costs at the Amerock business and investments in SGA in the tools business, partially offset by productivity and the sales increase noted above. Home Family Net sales for 2005 were $822.6 million, an increase of $13.8 million, or 1.7%, from $808.8 million in 2004, driven by favorable pricing and strong new product introductions in the Graco business. Operating income for 2005 was $103.5 million, an increase of $15.1 million, or 17.1%, from $88.4 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to favorable pricing, new product introductions and productivity initiatives, partially offset by raw material inflation. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents increased (decreased) as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Cash provided by operating activities $643.4 $641.6 $660.0 Cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (11.9 ) (766.7 ) 189.6 Cash used in financing activities (550.1 ) (257.2 ) (494.1 ) Exchange effect on cash and cash equivalents 4.1 (7.8 ) 5.7 Increase (Decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $85.5 ($390.1 ) $361.2 Sources The Companys primary sources of liquidity and capital resources include cash provided by operations, proceeds from divestitures and use of available borrowing facilities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $643.4 million compared to $641.6 million for the comparable period of 2005. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is a result of increased net income offset by higher working capital, primarily due to increased inventory to provide additional safety stock due to restructuring plans. In 2006, the Company received cash proceeds of $187.0 million related to the sale of businesses and other non current assets, compared to $65.5 million in 2005. In 2006, the Company received cash proceeds of $15.6 million related to the sale of other non current assets, compared to $64.3 million in 2005. In 2006, the Company sold the European Cookware and Little Tikes businesses, as well as the largest portion of its Home Dcor Europe business. In 2005, the Company sold the Curver business. In 2006, the Company received proceeds from the issuance of debt of $177.0 million compared to $337.0 million in 2005. Proceeds in 2005 reflect the issuance of commercial paper related to the funding of the November 2005 DYMO acquisition. The Company has short term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that are available for short term financing. Borrowings under the Companys uncommitted lines of credit are subject to the discretion of the lender. The Companys lines of credit do not have a material impact on the Companys liquidity. Borrowings under the Companys lines of credit at December 31, 2006 and 2005 totaled $23.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively. In November 2005, the Company entered into a $750.0 million syndicated revolving credit facility (the Revolver) pursuant to a five year credit agreement. On an annual basis, the Company may request an extension of the Revolver (subject to lender approval) for additional one year periods. The Company elected to extend the Revolver for an additional one year period and all but one lender approved the one year extension, which will now expire in November 2011. Accordingly, the Company has $750.0 million available under its revolving credit facility through 27 Table of Contents November 2010 and $725.0 million thereafter, through November 2011. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no borrowings under the Revolver. In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may issue up to $750.0 million of commercial paper through 2010 and $725.0 million thereafter, through 2011. The Revolver provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. The Revolver also provides for the issuance of up to $100.0 million of standby letters of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. At December 31, 2006, there was no commercial paper outstanding and there were no standby letters of credit issued under the Revolver. At December 31, 2005, $202.0 million of commercial paper was outstanding and there were no standby letters of credit issued under the Revolver. The Revolver permits the Company to borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms and requires, among other things, that the Company maintain certain Interest Coverage and Total Indebtedness to Total Capital Ratio, as defined in the agreement. The Revolver also limits Subsidiary Indebtedness. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company was in compliance with the terms of the agreement governing the Revolver. Under a 2001 receivables facility with a financial institution, the Company created a financing entity that is consolidated in the Companys financial statements. Under this facility, the Company regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity to sell an undivided interest in substantially all of the Companys United States trade receivables to the financing entity. In 2001, the financing entity issued $450.0 million in preferred debt securities to the financial institution. Certain levels of accounts receivable write offs and other events would permit the financial institution to terminate the receivables facility. On September 18, 2006, in accordance with the terms of the receivables facility, the financing entity caused the preferred debt securities to be exchanged for cash of $2.2 million, a two year floating rate note in an aggregate principal amount of $448.0 million and a cash premium of $5.2 million. Because this debt matures in 2008, the entire amount is considered to be long term. At any time prior to maturity of the note, the holder may elect to convert it into new preferred debt securities of the financing entity with a par value equal to the outstanding principal amount of the note. The note must be repaid and any preferred debt securities into which the note is converted must be retired or redeemed before the Company can have access to the financing entitys receivables. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the aggregate amount of outstanding receivables sold under this facility was $696.7 million and $746.9 million, respectively. The receivables and the preferred debt securities or note, as applicable, are recorded in the consolidated accounts of the Company. Uses The Companys primary uses of liquidity and capital resources include acquisitions, dividend payments, capital expenditures and payments on debt. Cash used for acquisitions was $60.6 million in 2006, compared to $740.0 million in 2005. In 2006, the Company did not invest in significant acquisitions. The cash used in 2005 related primarily to the acquisition of DYMO for $699.2 million, which was funded by $480.2 million of cash on hand and $219.0 million from existing credit facilities. See Footnote 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Capital expenditures were $138.3 million and $92.2 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures was driven by spending on the Companys SAP initiative. Capital expenditures for 2007 are expected to be in the range of $140 to $160 million. In 2006, the Company made payments on notes payable and long term debt of $511.0 million compared to $360.1 million in 2005. In 2006, the Company used available cash to pay off commercial paper and retire a $150 million, 6.6% fixed rate medium term note that matured. In 2005, the Company purchased 750,000 shares of its 5.25% convertible preferred securities from holders at an average price of $47.075 per share ($35.3 million). See Footnote 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions. Aggregate dividends paid were $232.8 million and $231.5 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2007, the Company expects to make similar dividend payments. 28 Table of Contents Cash used for restructuring activities was $26.1 million and $34.3 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. These payments relate primarily to employee termination benefits. In 2007, the Company expects to use approximately $100 to $125 million of cash on restructuring activities related to Project Acceleration. See Footnote 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2006, the Company made a voluntary $20.9 million cash contribution to fund its defined contribution plan. In 2005, the Company made a voluntary $25.0 million cash contribution to fund its foreign pension plans. In 2005, the Company terminated a cross currency interest rate swap and paid $26.9 million. This payment has been recognized in operating cash flow. Retained earnings increased in 2006 by $152.1 million. The increase in retained earnings is due to the current year net income, partially offset by cash dividends paid on common stock. See the Statements of Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive (Loss) Income for additional details. Working capital at December 31, 2006 was $580.3 million compared to $675.3 million at December 31, 2005. The current ratio at December 31, 2006 was 1.31:1 compared to 1.38:1 at December 31, 2005. The decrease in working capital is due to the sale of substantially all of the businesses classified as discontinued operations, the proceeds of which were used to pay down debt. Total debt to total capitalization (total debt is net of cash and cash equivalents, and total capitalization includes total debt and stockholders equity) was .52:1 at December 31, 2006 and ..60:1 at December 31, 2005. The Company believes that cash provided from operations and available borrowing facilities will continue to provide adequate support for the cash needs of existing businesses on a short term basis; however, certain events, such as significant acquisitions, could require additional external financing on a long term basis. Resolution of Income Tax Contingencies In 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded $102.8 million and $73.9 million, respectively, in income tax benefit as a result of favorable resolution of certain tax matters, the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters and the reorganization of certain legal entities in Europe. These benefits are reflected in the Companys 2006 and 2005 Consolidated Statements of Operations. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in its consolidated financial statements. Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of December 31, 2006 and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements. The following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations listed below are expected to have on the Companys cash flow in the indicated period. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2006. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as referenced in the table (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt maturities (1) $ 2,225.9 $ 253.6 $703.0 $ 254.7 $ 1,014.6 Interest on long term debt (2) 1,152.0 117.3 185.0 126.0 723.7 Operating lease obligations (3) 292.5 63.4 95.9 51.6 81.6 Purchase obligations (4) 389.1 362.4 26.7 Total contractual obligations (5) $ 4,059.5 $ 796.7 $ 1,010.6 $ 432.3 $ 1,819.9 29 Table of Contents (1) Amounts represent contractual obligations due, excluding interest, based on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2006. For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnotes 9 and 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Amounts represent estimated interest expense on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2006. Interest on floating debt was estimated using the index rate in effect as of December 31, 2006. For further information relating to this obligation, see Footnotes 9 and 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Amounts represent contractual minimum lease obligations on operating leases as of December 31, 2006. For further information relating to this obligation, see Footnote 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Primarily consists of purchase commitments entered into as of December 31, 2006 for finished goods, raw materials, components and services and joint venture interests pursuant to legally enforceable and binding obligations, which include all significant terms. (5) Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2006 balance sheet as current liabilities, except for current portion of long term debt. The Company also has obligations with respect to its pension and post retirement medical benefit plans. See Footnote 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had $95.4 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Companys self insurance programs, including workers compensation, product liability, and medical. See Footnote 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2006, the Company did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Critical Accounting Policies The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Footnote 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections describe the Companys critical accounting policies. Sales Recognition Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership change, which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms. Sales are net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other sales related discounts. Recovery of Accounts Receivable The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. When aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience. Accounts are reviewed for potential write off on a case by case basis. Accounts deemed uncollectible are written off, net of expected recoveries. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Companys estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had allowances for doubtful accounts of $26.3 million on $1,139.9 million of accounts receivable. 30 Table of Contents Inventory Reserves The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets The Company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its annual strategic planning process for all of its businesses. The Company also tests for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the indefinite life intangible asset is below its carrying amount. The Company tests for impairment at the operating segment level. The Company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the Companys customer base, or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers. Additionally, increases in the risk adjusted rate could result in impairment charges. The Company assesses the fair value of its reporting units for its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks and tradenames) in its impairment tests, generally based upon a discounted cash flow methodology, or an actual sales offer received from a prospective buyer, if available. The discounted cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses, working capital, terminal value, and market discount rates. The underlying assumptions used are consistent with those used in the strategic plan. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value, goodwill impairment may be present. The Company measures the goodwill impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recorded intangible asset exceeds the fair value. Other Long Lived Assets The Company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment and other long lived assets are present. These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group. If impairment indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount. The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses, working capital, and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the strategic plan. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the product line level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available. Product Liability Reserves The Company has a self insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance. The Company uses historical loss experience combined with 31 Table of Contents actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves. The Companys actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the Companys product liability reserve. The Company has product liability reserves of $30.6 million as of December 31, 2006. While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company and such additional losses may be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Environmental Reserves The Company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as contract and other disputes. The Company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters. The estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. No insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the Companys cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Companys cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to long term operations and maintenance CERCLA matters which are estimated at present value. The Companys estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of December 31, 2006 ranged between $15.9 million and $35.6 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had a reserve of $19.8 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate, which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income Tax Contingencies The Company establishes a tax contingency reserve for certain tax exposures when it is not probable that the Companys tax position will be ultimately sustained. The Company eliminates a tax contingency reserve balance when it becomes probable that the Companys tax position will ultimately be sustained, which generally occurs when the statute of limitations for a specific exposure item has expired or when the Company has reached agreement with the taxing authorities on the treatment of an item. The Company generally assesses its tax contingency reserves on a quarterly basis. Management cannot determine with certainty the ultimate resolution of these tax matters. Actual results may differ from the recorded amounts. Stock Options Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R), using the modified prospective method and therefore has not restated results for prior periods. Under this transition method, stock based compensation expense for 2006 includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Stock based compensation expense for all awards granted after December 31, 2005 is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). The Company recognizes stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally five years for stock options and three years for restricted stock. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company recognized stock based compensation expense by applying the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent managements best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If our actual pre vesting forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from our estimates. See Footnote 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of stock based compensation. 32 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, by defining a criterion that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an enterprises financial statements. The interpretation would require a review of all tax positions accounted for in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109 and apply a more likely than not recognition threshold. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Subsequent recognition, derecognition, and measurement is based on managements best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, which the Company intends to adopt on January 1, 2007. The Company does not believe the new Interpretation will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations, however, adoption may result in the reclassification of certain income tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet and an immaterial adjustment to the balance of retained earnings. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement, not an entity specific measurement, and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and the Company intends to adopt the standard on January 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 157 will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows, but does not believe the effect will be material. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. SFAS 158 also requires the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of financial position beginning with years ending after December 15, 2008 (with limited exceptions). Effective December 31, 2006, the Company recognized the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plan and provided the required disclosures as a result of the adoption of SFAS 158. The effect of adoption of SFAS 158 on the Companys financial condition at December 31, 2006 has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. See Footnote 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company currently measures defined benefit plan assets and liabilities for the majority of its plans on September 30th and expects to adopt the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 in 2008. International Operations For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Companys non U.S. businesses accounted for approximately 26%, 24% and 24% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Changes in both U.S. and non U.S. net sales are shown below for the years ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 33 Table of Contents 2006 vs. 2005 vs. 2005 % 2004 % 2006 2005 2004 Change Change U.S. $ 4,603.4 $ 4,338.5 $ 4,365.6 6.1 % (0.6 )% Non U.S 1,597.6 1,378.7 1,341.5 15.9 2.8 $ 6,201.0 $ 5,717.2 $ 5,707.1 8.5 % 0.2 % Forward Looking Statements Forward looking statements in this Report are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward looking statements may relate to, but are not limited to, information or assumptions about the effects of Project Acceleration, sales, income/(loss), earnings per share, operating income or gross margin improvements, return on equity, return on invested capital, capital expenditures, working capital, cash flow, dividends, capital structure, debt to capitalization ratios, interest rates, internal growth rates, restructuring, impairment and other charges, potential losses on divestitures, impact of changes in accounting standards, pending legal proceedings and claims (including environmental matters), future economic performance, costs and cost savings (including raw material inflation, productivity and streamlining), synergies, managements plans, goals and objectives for future operations, performance and growth or the assumptions relating to any of the forward looking statements. These statements generally are accompanied by words such as intend, anticipate, believe, estimate, project, target, plan, expect, will, should or similar statements. The Company cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees because there are inherent difficulties in predicting future results. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those matters set forth in this Report generally and Item 1A this Report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The Companys market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices. Pursuant to the Companys policies, natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions, and, for qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense. The Companys foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less. The Company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form: 1) offsetting or netting of like foreign currency flows, 2) structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk, 3) converting excess foreign currency deposits into U.S. dollars or the relevant functional currency and 4) avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency. In addition, the Company utilizes forward contracts and purchased options to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions. Derivatives used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company purchases certain raw materials, including resin, corrugate, steel, stainless steel, aluminum and other metals, which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors. While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, a variety of programs, including periodic raw material purchases, purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the Company address this risk. Where practical, the Company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process. During 2006, the Company experienced raw material inflation, which was more than offset by pricing increases, favorable mix and productivity. The amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the Company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model. The value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation 34 Table of Contents of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variance/covariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures (specifically excluding equity method investments). The fair value losses shown in the table below have no impact on results of operations or financial condition, but are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. The following table indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (in millions, except percentages): 2006 December 31, 2005 December 31, Confidence Market Risk Average 2006 Average 2005 Level Interest rates $ 8.0 $ 7.5 $ 9.5 $ 8.1 95 % Foreign exchange $ 5.0 $ 3.5 $ 3.1 $ 5.6 95 % The 95% confidence interval signifies the Companys degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the Companys favor. The value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse. Actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is highly unlikely that the Company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets.
