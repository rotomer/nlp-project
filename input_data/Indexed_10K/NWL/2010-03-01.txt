ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Business Overview Newell Rubbermaid is a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that touch the lives of people where they work, live and play. The Companys products are marketed under a strong portfolio of brands, including Rubbermaid&reg;, Graco&reg;, Aprica&reg;, Levolor&reg;, Calphalon&reg;, Goody&reg;, Sharpie&reg;, Paper Mate&reg;, Dymo&reg;, Parker&reg;, Waterman&reg;, Irwin&reg;, Lenox&reg; and Technical Concepts. The Companys multi product offering consists of well known name brand consumer and commercial products in three business segments: Home & Family; Office Products; and Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products. Business Strategy Newell Rubbermaids vision is to become a global company of Brands That Matter and great people, known for best in class results. The Company is committed to building consumer meaningful brands through understanding the needs of consumers and using those insights to create innovative, highly differentiated product solutions that offer performance and value. To support its multi year transformation into a best in class global consumer branding and marketing organization, the Company has adopted a strategy that focuses on optimizing the business portfolio, building consumer meaningful brands on a global scale, and achieving best cost and efficiency in its operations. Optimizing the business portfolio includes reducing the Companys exposure to non strategic businesses and product lines and acquiring businesses that facilitate geographic and category expansion, thus enhancing the potential for growth and improved profitability of the overall portfolio. Building consumer meaningful brands involves embracing a consumer driven innovation process, developing best in class marketing and branding capabilities across the organization and investing in strategic brand building activities, including investments in research and development to better understand target consumers and their needs. Achieving best cost involves the Companys adoption of best in class practices, such as leveraging scale, restructuring the supply chain to improve capacity utilization and to deliver productivity savings, reducing costs in nonmarket facing activities, designing products to optimize input costs, and utilizing strategic sourcing partners when it is cost effective. Achieving best cost allows the Company to improve its competitive position, generate funds for increased investment in strategic brand building initiatives, and preserve cash and liquidity. Market Overview The Company operates in the consumer and commercial products markets, which are generally impacted by overall economic conditions in the regions in which the Company operates. The Companys results in 2009 have been adversely impacted by weakness in consumer confidence and consumer spending due to the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions. In particular, the Companys results for 2009 have been impacted by the following principal factors: Lower consumer confidence and corresponding lower demand, which has resulted in reduced consumer foot traffic and destocking of customer inventory, negatively impacting sales and contributing to an overall year over year core sales decline of approximately 7%. Core sales represent net sales excluding the impacts of acquisitions, currency and product line exits. The primary drivers of the core sales decline were continued weakness in economic conditions internationally, which resulted in a year over year core sales decline of approximately 11% in the Companys international businesses and lower demand in the commercial and industrial channels, which contributed to a year over year core sales decline of approximately 16% in the Companys Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products segment. Less volatile commodities markets, which have resulted in lower input costs relative to 2008, as the Companys input costs in 2008 were higher due to dramatic raw material inflation. Continued volatility in the credit markets, which has contributed to the decline in consumer demand and has resulted in reductions in available capital and financing for businesses and increases in costs associated with capital and financing. 20 Table of Contents In response to these conditions, the Company took the following actions: Managed working capital to improve operating cash flows, with a particular focus on reducing inventory levels. During 2009, the Company focused on optimizing its production capacity and sourcing of finished goods to correspond to anticipated reductions in demand. The Company reduced inventory levels and realized cash flows from such reductions of $243 million in 2009, compared to approximately $31 million in 2008. Continued to exit and rationalize low margin product categories where demand is less responsive to innovation and input costs are subject to volatile commodities markets. In 2009, the product line exits have resulted in an approximate 5% year over year sales decline while contributing approximately 140 basis points to the year over year gross margin expansion. Overall, the Company realized a 390 basis point improvement in gross margins in 2009 due to the positive impact of the product line exits, productivity gains, the effect of pricing initiatives and input cost moderation compared with the dramatic inflation experienced in 2008, which combined more than offset the adverse effects of an unfavorable customer and product mix and lower plant utilization rates resulting from the sales decline and the customer inventory reductions. Continued to improve the cost structure of the business by reducing and streamlining structural selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs, including consolidating the segment structure from four to three. The Company also outlined and implemented an initiative with a focus on continuing to reduce structural overhead costs by simplifying work and consolidating offices, and implemented selected contingency plans early in 2009 to eliminate or delay costs where possible. Selectively invested in strategic SG&A to drive sales and enhance its new product pipeline. During 2009, the Companys selective investments in strategic brand building and consumer demand creation included investments in the following: the Uncap Whats Inside campaign for the Companys Sharpie&reg; products; the expansion of the Calphalon product family to include the Unison line of non stick, dishwasher safe gourmet cookware; the expansion of Rubbermaid Consumers food storage product line to include Lock Its storage containers with locking lid tabs; the introduction of Graco products such as the Blossom 4 in 1 feeding chair and the Pack n Play&reg; Playard with its Newborn Napper feature; and sales and new product development activities in selected areas to improve public health, including the Technical Concepts offering of hand sanitizer and hand cleanser dispensers, and education, such as mimio&reg;s interactive whiteboard technology and student response systems. The Company maintained its investments in research and development in 2009 compared to 2008 despite deterioration in economic conditions and the associated impact on the Company. The Company expects to continue to make incremental investments in research and development and other strategic SG&A activities in 2010. Improved liquidity and reduced total indebtedness by $371 million in 2009, including raising approximately $590 million in the public debt markets (after transaction costs and net costs associated with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions) and completing a new receivables backed credit facility that provides for maximum borrowings of up to $200 million. The Company repaid $448 million of amounts outstanding under its previous receivables facility and redeemed $395 million principal amount of medium term notes. Reduced the dividend payable on its common stock from $0.84 per year to $0.20 per year. The new dividend policy better positions the Company to protect its investment grade credit rating and enhance its liquidity. Ongoing Initiatives Project Acceleration Project Acceleration is designed to reduce manufacturing overhead, better align the Companys distribution and transportation processes, and reorganize the overall business structure to align with the Companys core organizing concept, the global business unit, to achieve best total cost. Through the Project Acceleration restructuring program and other initiatives, the Company has made significant progress in improving capacity utilization rates to deliver productivity savings and in increasing the use of strategic sourcing partners. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company completed or implemented a number of restructuring programs as part of Project Acceleration to reduce and realign its manufacturing footprint, including two programs in its Home & Family segment in North America, two programs in its Office Products segments international operations, one program in its Office Products segments North American operations, and three programs in its Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products segments 21 Table of Contents international operations. Since the inception of Project Acceleration, the Company has reduced its manufacturing footprint by more than 50%, including the closure or disposition of more than 20 manufacturing facilities and the transfer of 19 manufacturing facilities to purchasers in connection with divestitures of businesses. The Company expects to have completed implementation of its Project Acceleration restructuring initiative by the end of 2010, and the total costs incurred over the life of the initiative are expected to be between $475 million and $500 million, including $250 million to $270 million of employee related costs, $155 million to $175 million in non cash asset related costs, and $50 million to $70 million in other associated restructuring costs. The Company has incurred $421 million of restructuring costs under Project Acceleration through December 31, 2009 and expects to incur between $60 million and $80 million of additional costs to complete Project Acceleration. Approximately 67% of the total Project Acceleration restructuring costs are expected to be cash charges. Cumulative annualized savings expected to be realized from the implementation of Project Acceleration are in excess of $200 million once completed, with more than $160 million in annualized savings realized to date. The Company continues to evaluate its supply chain to identify opportunities to realize efficiencies in purchasing, distribution and transportation. In 2009, the Company began consolidating its Southeast U.S. distribution operations into a single Southeast U.S. distribution center, which included the closure of multiple distribution facilities throughout the Southeast region of the U.S. The Company also continues to focus on rationalizing its use of multiple third party distribution and logistics service providers, consolidating such operations into Company owned facilities where possible. In an effort to align the business with the global business unit structure and achieve best total cost, the Company continues to evaluate and optimize its overall organizational structure and consolidate activities. In this regard, the Company has reduced its worldwide headcount by 10%, or 2,400 employees, in 2009. One Newell Rubbermaid The Company strives to leverage the common business activities and best practices of its business units, and to build one common culture of shared values with a focus on collaboration and teamwork. Through this initiative, the Company has established regional shared service centers to leverage nonmarket facing functional capabilities to reduce costs. The Company is migrating multiple legacy systems and users to a common SAP global information platform in a phased, multi year rollout. SAP is expected to enable the Company to integrate and manage its worldwide business and reporting processes more efficiently. To date, the North American operations of 10 of the Companys 13 GBUs have successfully gone live with their SAP implementation efforts, with the majority of the Companys remaining North American operations scheduled to go live in 2010. 22 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company believes the selected data and the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Operations are important in evaluating the Companys operations. The following table sets forth items from the Consolidated Statements of Operations as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 5,577.6 100.0 % $ 6,470.6 100.0 % $ 6,407.3 100.0% Cost of products sold 3,528.1 63.3 4,347.4 67.2 4,150.1 64.8 Gross margin 2,049.5 36.7 2,123.2 32.8 2,257.2 35.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,374.6 24.6 1,502.7 23.2 1,430.9 22.3 Impairment charges 299.4 4.6 Restructuring costs 100.0 1.8 120.3 1.9 86.0 1.3 Operating income 574.9 10.3 200.8 3.1 740.3 11.6 Nonoperating expenses: Interest expense, net 140.0 2.5 137.9 2.1 104.1 1.6 Other expense, net 6.7 0.1 59.1 0.9 4.2 0.1 Net nonoperating expenses 146.7 2.6 197.0 3.0 108.3 1.7 Income before income taxes 428.2 7.7 3.8 0.1 632.0 9.9 Income taxes 142.7 2.6 53.6 0.8 149.7 2.3 Income (loss) from continuing operations 285.5 5.1 (49.8 ) (0.8 ) 482.3 7.5 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (0.5 ) (12.1 ) (0.2) Net income (loss) 285.5 5.1 (50.3 ) (0.8 ) 470.2 7.3 Net income noncontrolling interests 2.0 3.1 Net income (loss) controlling interests $ 285.5 5.1 % $ (52.3 ) (0.8 )% $ 467.1 7.3% Results of Operations 2009 vs. 2008 Net sales for 2009 were $5,577.6 million, representing a decrease of $893.0 million, or 13.8%, from $6,470.6 million for 2008. Core sales declined 7.3% compared to the prior year resulting from the lower consumer foot traffic and lower product demand as well as inventory destocking at the retail level and in the commercial and industrial channels. Geographically, core sales of the Companys domestic and international businesses declined approximately 6% and 11%, respectively, versus the prior year. Planned product line exits and foreign currency contributed an additional 5.2% and 2.1% to the year over year sales decline, respectively. The Technical Concepts and Aprica acquisitions increased sales 0.8% over the prior year. Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2009 was 36.7%, or $2,049.5 million, versus 32.8% of net sales, or $2,123.2 million, for 2008. The primary drivers of the 390 basis point gross margin expansion included benefits realized from product line exits, moderating input costs compared to 2008 and pricing actions initiated late in 2008 and early 2009. These improvements more than offset the adverse impacts of reduced production volumes in the Companys manufacturing facilities and unfavorable product and customer mix. SG&A expenses for 2009 were 24.6% of net sales, or $1,374.6 million, versus 23.2% of net sales, or $1,502.7 million, for 2008. The $128.1 million decrease was primarily driven by the Companys continued management of SG&A spending as well as cost reduction programs initiated during late 2008 and early 2009 to mitigate the negative impact of the decline in sales. Foreign currency translation represented $37.8 million of the $128.1 million decline, which was partially offset by $21.2 million of incremental SG&A costs resulting from the Technical Concepts and Aprica acquisitions. The Company recorded restructuring costs of $100.0 million and $120.3 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Companys restructuring costs in 2009 related primarily to optimizing the cost structure of the business and secondarily to reducing the Companys manufacturing footprint, whereas the restructuring costs in 2008 primarily related to product line exits and reducing the Companys manufacturing footprint. The restructuring costs for 2009 included $32.4 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs, $48.8 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs, and $18.8 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. The restructuring costs for 2008 included $46.1 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs, $57.5 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs, and $16.7 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. See Footnote 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 23 Table of Contents The adverse impact of the macroeconomic environment on the Company during the fourth quarter of 2008, particularly the rapid decrease in consumer demand, combined with the updated outlook for certain of the Companys reporting units led the Company to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2008. As a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded a non cash impairment charge of $299.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 principally related to goodwill of certain reporting units in the Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products and Office Products segments. No similar impairment charges were recorded in 2009. Operating income for 2009 was 10.3% of net sales, or $574.9 million, versus 3.1% of net sales, or $200.8 million for 2008. The 720 basis point improvement primarily relates to the goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2008, with no similar impairment charges in 2009. The improvement also reflects the favorable impacts of product line exits and moderating input costs in 2009, partially offset by an increase in SG&A costs as a percentage of sales. Interest expense, net, for 2009 was $140.0 million compared to $137.9 million for 2008. The $2.1 million increase in interest expense reflects higher average debt outstanding year over year. Other expense, net, for 2009 was $6.7 million versus $59.1 million for 2008. The decrease in other expense, net, is primarily attributable to the $52.2 million loss on debt extinguishment relating to the Companys redemption of its $250.0 million of medium term Reset notes in July 2008. The Company recognized income tax expense of $142.7 million in 2009 compared to $53.6 million in 2008. The increase in tax expense was primarily a result of an increase in income before income taxes in 2009 compared to 2008 as well as the recognition of income tax benefits of $3.1 million and $29.9 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to favorable outcomes from the IRSs review of specific deductions and accrual reversals for items for which the statute of limitations expired. The impacts of these items were partially offset by the tax impacts of the impairment charges recorded in 2008, because substantially all of the impairment charges were not deductible for tax purposes, and accordingly, only nominal tax benefits were recognized in 2008 associated with the impairment charges. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Results of Operations 2008 vs. 2007 Net sales for 2008 were $6,470.6 million, representing an increase of $63.3 million, or 1%, from $6,407.3 million for 2007. Core sales declined approximately 3.0% compared to the prior year. The Technical Concepts and Aprica acquisitions increased sales by $204.7 million, or 3.2%, over the prior year, and foreign currency contributed 0.8% of sales growth. Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2008 was 32.8%, or $2,123.2 million, versus 35.2%, or $2,257.2 million, for 2007. The primary drivers of the 240 basis point gross margin contraction included the impact of raw material and sourced goods inflation as well as lower manufacturing volumes and unfavorable product mix experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008, partially offset by benefits from productivity improvements from Project Acceleration and other initiatives. SG&A expenses for 2008 were 23.2% of net sales, or $1,502.7 million, versus 22.3% of net sales, or $1,430.9 million, for 2007. The $71.8 million increase was primarily driven by SG&A expenses associated with the Technical Concepts and Aprica acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency, which more than offset the impacts of the Companys management of structural and strategic SG&A spending. The Company recorded restructuring costs of $120.3 million and $86.0 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in restructuring costs for 2008 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to $36.0 million of asset impairment charges recorded in 2008 associated with the Companys plan to divest, downsize or exit certain product categories where resin is the primary component of cost of products sold. The 2008 restructuring costs included $46.1 million of facility and other exit costs, including the $36.0 million of asset impairment charges noted above, $57.5 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs, and $16.7 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs, of which $3.1 million relates to the Companys 2001 Restructuring Plan. The 2007 restructuring costs included $27.7 million of facility and other exit costs, $36.4 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $21.9 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. See Footnote 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company recorded a non cash impairment charge of $299.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 principally related to goodwill of certain reporting units in the Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products and Office Products segments. No similar impairment charges were recorded in 2007. Operating income for 2008 was $200.8 million, or 3.1% of net sales, versus $740.3 million, or 11.6% of net sales, in 2007. The 850 basis point decline is primarily attributable to the $299.4 million of impairment charges noted above, the impact of raw material and sourced goods inflation on gross margin and the $36.0 million of Project Acceleration asset impairment charges in 2008 discussed above, partially offset by improvements from productivity initiatives. 24 Table of Contents Interest expense, net, for 2008 was $137.9 million versus $104.1 million for 2007. The $33.8 million year over year increase was primarily driven by additional borrowings in 2008 used to fund the acquisitions of Aprica and Technical Concepts. Other expense, net, for 2008 was $59.1 million versus $4.2 million for 2007. The increase in other expense, net, in 2008 is primarily attributable to the $52.2 million loss on debt extinguishment relating to the Companys redemption of its $250.0 million of medium term Reset notes in July 2008. The Company recognized income tax expense of $53.6 million for 2008, compared to $149.7 million for 2007. The decrease in tax expense was primarily a result of a decrease in income before income taxes in 2008 compared to 2007. The impact of the decrease in operating income from 2007 to 2008 on income tax expense was partially offset by a decrease in the tax rates applied to the various discrete expenses, including restructuring and impairment charges, in 2008 compared to 2007, which had the effect of increasing income tax expense in 2008 compared to 2007. Income tax expense for 2008 and 2007 was favorably impacted by the recognition of net income tax benefits of $29.9 million and $41.3 million, respectively, primarily related to favorable outcomes from the IRSs review of specific deductions and accrual reversals for items for which the statute of limitations expired. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. For 2007, the Company recognized a loss from operations of discontinued operations of $0.2 million, net of tax, related to the results of the remaining operations of the Home D&eacute;cor Europe business and a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of $11.9 million, net of tax, related primarily to the disposal of the remaining operations of the Home D&eacute;cor Europe business. Business Segment Operating Results 2009 vs. 2008 Business Segment Operating Results Net sales by segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2009 2008 % Change Home & Family $ 2,377.2 $ 2,654.8 (10.5)% Office Products 1,674.7 1,990.8 (15.9) Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products 1,525.7 1,825.0 (16.4) Total Net Sales $ 5,577.6 $ 6,470.6 (13.8)% Operating income (loss) by segment was as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2009 2008 % Change Home & Family $ 274.7 $ 218.3 25.8% Office Products 235.2 212.4 10.7 Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products 245.6 271.7 (9.6) Corporate (80.6 ) (81.9 ) 1.6 Impairment charges (299.4 ) NMF Restructuring costs (100.0 ) (120.3 ) 16.9% Total Operating Income $ 574.9 $ 200.8 NMF NMF Not meaningful Home & Family Net sales for 2009 were $2,377.2 million, a decrease of $277.6 million, or 10.5%, from $2,654.8 million for 2008. Core sales declined 2.1% as low single digit core sales growth in the Culinary Lifestyles GBU was offset by a high single digit decline in the D&eacute;cor GBU, which continues to be impacted by softness in residential construction, as well as a mid single digit decline in the Baby & Parenting Essentials GBU, which was adversely impacted by softness in the baby category worldwide. Net sales declined 8.1% due to product line exits in the Rubbermaid Consumer GBU and 1.3% due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts. The Aprica acquisition increased sales 1.0% compared to the prior year. Operating income for 2009 was $274.7 million, or 11.6% of net sales, an increase of $56.4 million, or 25.8%, from $218.3 million, or 8.2% of net sales, for 2008. The 340 basis point improvement in operating margin was primarily due to moderating input costs, 25 Table of Contents product line exits and productivity improvements. In the aggregate, these improvements contributed 450 basis points to the net expansion in operating margin and were partially offset by unfavorable mix and an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. Office Products Net sales for 2009 were $1,674.7 million, a decrease of $316.1 million, or 15.9%, from $1,990.8 million for 2008. Core sales declined 6.5%, which was primarily attributable to weak consumer demand both domestically and internationally and inventory destocking at the retail level. Reduced sales relating to product line exits and unfavorable foreign currency contributed an additional 6.0% and 3.4%, respectively, to the year over year decline. Operating income for 2009 was $235.2 million, or 14.0% of net sales, an increase of $22.8 million, or 10.7%, from $212.4 million, or 10.7% of net sales for 2008. The 330 basis point improvement in operating margin was primarily attributable to product line exits. In constant currency, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2009 were comparable to 2008. Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products Net sales for 2009 were $1,525.7 million, a decrease of $299.3 million, or 16.4%, from $1,825.0 million for 2008. Core sales declined 15.8% as sales volumes were negatively impacted by inventory management by retail, commercial and industrial customers; continued softness in the residential construction market, both domestically and internationally; and sustained weakness in industrial and commercial channels. Unfavorable foreign currency contributed an additional 2.0% decline, and the Technical Concepts acquisition increased sales $26.2 million, or 1.4%, versus the prior year. Operating income for 2009 was $245.6 million, or 16.1% of net sales, a decrease of $26.1 million, or 9.6%, from $271.7 million, or 14.9% of net sales, for 2008. The 120 basis point expansion in operating margin was primarily driven by the moderation of input costs compared to the prior year and improved product mix, which combined contributed 190 basis points to the expansion, as well as productivity gains, all of which were partially offset by the adverse impacts of lower production volumes. The lower production volumes were primarily the result of aggressive management of inventory levels by the Companys customers and lower sales resulting from weak demand. In constant currency, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2009 were comparable to 2008. 2008 vs. 2007 Business Segment Operating Results Net sales by segment were as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2008 2007 % Change Home & Family $ 2,654.8 $ 2,610.8 1.7% Office Products 1,990.8 2,026.2 (1.7) Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products 1,825.0 1,770.3 3.1 Total Net Sales $ 6,470.6 $ 6,407.3 1.0% Operating income (loss) by segment was as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2008 2007 % Change Home & Family $ 218.3 $ 307.5 (29.0)% Office Products 212.4 315.8 (32.7) Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products 271.7 285.0 (4.7) Corporate (81.9 ) (82.0 ) 0.1 Impairment charges (299.4 ) NMF Restructuring costs (120.3 ) (86.0 ) (39.9) Total Operating Income $ 200.8 $ 740.3 (72.9)% NMF Not meaningful Home & Family Net sales for 2008 were $2,654.8 million, an increase of $44.0 million, or 1.7%, from $2,610.8 million in 2007. Core sales declined 0.8% as mid single digit core sales growth in the Baby & Parenting Essentials GBU was offset by softness in the D&eacute;cor GBU. The Aprica acquisition increased sales $95.5 million, or 3.7%, while favorable foreign currency contributed an additional 0.2% to the overall sales improvement. The adverse impact from product line exits reduced sales 1.4%. 26 Table of Contents Operating income for 2008 was $218.3 million, or 8.2% of net sales, a decrease of $89.2 million from $307.5 million, or 11.8% of net sales, in 2007. The 360 basis point decline was primarily driven by unfavorable mix and by sourced product and input cost inflation, particularly in resin, which combined contributed an estimated 590 basis points to the decline. These declines were partially offset by benefits realized from tighter management of SG&A costs. Office Products Net sales for 2008 were $1,990.8 million, a decrease of $35.4 million, or 1.7%, from $2,026.2 million in 2007. Core sales declined 3.2%, due to lower consumer demand and customer inventory management. Favorable foreign currency increased sales 1.5%. Operating income for 2008 was $212.4 million, or 10.7% of net sales, a decrease of $103.4 million, from $315.8 million, or 15.6% of net sales, in 2007. The 490 basis point decline was primarily attributable to input cost inflation, unfavorable mix and reduced production volumes at the Companys manufacturing facilities, which combined contributed an estimated 330 basis points to the overall decline. The remaining decline was primarily driven by an increase in SG&A spending as a percentage of sales, partially offset by benefits from pricing initiatives implemented during 2008. Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products Net sales for 2008 were $1,825.0 million, an increase of $54.7 million, or 3.1%, from $1,770.3 million in 2007. Core sales declined 3.9% as mid single digit core sales growth in the Rubbermaid Commercial Products GBU was more than offset by declines in core sales in the Companys Industrial Products & Services and Construction Tools & Accessories GBUs due to continued declines in the residential construction market, customer inventory management and increased softness in industrial and commercial channels. The Technical Concepts acquisition increased net sales $109.2 million, or 6.2%, while favorable foreign currency increased sales 0.8%. Operating income for 2008 was $271.7 million, or 14.9% of net sales, a decrease of $13.3 million from $285.0 million, or 16.1% of net sales, in 2007. The 120 basis point decline is attributable to input cost inflation and unfavorable mix, which combined contributed approximately 420 basis points to the overall decline, partially offset by contributions from SG&A expense reduction initiatives, favorable pricing and productivity improvements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased (decreased) as follows for the year ended December 31, (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Cash provided by operating activities $ 602.8 $ 454.9 $ 655.3 Cash used in investing activities (149.4 ) (804.1 ) (265.6) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (427.0 ) 306.0 (266.8) Exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents (23.5 ) (10.6 ) 5.3 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 2.9 $ (53.8 ) $ 128.2 In the cash flow statement, the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the effects of acquisitions, as these do not reflect actual cash flows. Accordingly, the amounts in the cash flow statement differ from changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheets. Sources Historically, the Companys primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have included cash provided by operations, issuance of debt and use of available borrowing facilities. Cash provided by operating activities for 2009 was $602.8 million compared to $454.9 million for 2008. This improvement is primarily attributable to working capital improvements, driven mainly by $243.1 million of cash provided by reducing inventories in 2009 compared to $30.9 million in 2008, and an approximate $75.0 million decrease in payments in 2009 compared to 2008 for annual performance based compensation, which is generally paid in the first quarter of the year based on the previous years results. Cash provided by operating activities for 2009 includes a $75.0 million voluntary cash contribution the Company made to its primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan and $126.6 million paid to settle foreign exchange contracts on intercompany financing arrangements and cross currency interest rate swaps. Cash provided by operating activities for 2008 reflects a $200.4 million decrease from $655.3 million for 2007. The decrease is attributable primarily to lower income from continuing operations, a reduction in accounts payable, and the timing of payments of accrued liabilities, including income taxes, partially offset by working capital reductions driven by improved collection on accounts receivable and tighter management of inventory levels. 27 Table of Contents The Company received proceeds of $827.3 million, $1,318.0 million and $420.8 million from the issuance of debt in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In March 2009, the Company completed the offering and sale of $300.0 million unsecured and unsubordinated notes and $345.0 million convertible senior notes. The $624.3 million of net proceeds from these note issuances were used to complete the tender offers to repurchase $325.0 million principal amount of medium term notes and convertible note hedge transactions and for general corporate purposes. Also related to the issuance of the convertible senior notes, the Company entered into warrant transactions in which the Company sold warrants to third parties for approximately $32.7 million. See Footnote 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions. During 2009, the Company borrowed and repaid $70.0 million under a 364 day receivables facility that was completed in September 2009 and borrowed and repaid $125.0 million under its syndicated revolving credit facility (the Revolver). In September 2008, the Company entered into a $400.0 million credit agreement, under which the Company received an unsecured three year term loan in the amount of $400.0 million (the Term Loan). Net proceeds from the Term Loan were used to repay outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. In March 2008, the Company completed the offering and sale of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $500.0 million in 5.50% senior unsecured notes due April 2013 and $250.0 million in 6.25% senior unsecured notes due April 2018. Net proceeds from this offering were used to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the issuance of debt in 2007 include the issuance of commercial paper to fund acquisitions and the repayment of a five year, $250.0 million medium term note that matured in 2007. Uses Historically, the Companys primary uses of liquidity and capital resources have included acquisitions, dividend payments, capital expenditures and payments on debt. The Company made aggregate payments on short and long term debt of $1,113.0 million, $772.5 million and $478.3 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The $1,113.0 million of repayments in 2009 includes $329.7 million used to complete tender offers to repurchase $180.1 million principal amount of the $250.0 million medium term notes due December 2009 and $144.9 million principal amount of the $250.0 million medium term notes due May 2010 (the Tender Offers), the $448.0 million repayment of the floating rate note issued under the Companys 2001 receivables facility, the repayment of $125.0 million of borrowings under the Revolver, a $50.0 million principal payment on the Term Loan, and the repayment of the remaining $69.9 million principal amount outstanding of the $250.0 million medium term notes due December 2009. Also, as part of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in March 2009, the Company purchased call options from third parties for $69.0 million. See Footnote 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the call option transaction. In July 2008, the Company redeemed its $250.0 million of Reset notes due July 2028 for $302.2 million, which includes the Companys purchase of the remarketing option embedded in the Reset notes from a third party for $52.2 million. In July 2008, the Company also repaid $65.0 million of its $75.0 million outstanding 6.11% medium term notes due July 2028 in accordance with the terms of the notes. The Company utilized its commercial paper program to fund the redemption of the Reset notes, the purchase of the remarketing option, and the repayment of the $65.0 million of 6.11% medium term notes due July 2028. The remaining payments made on debt during 2008 mainly represent the payoff of commercial paper. In 2007, the Company retired a five year, $250 million, 6% fixed rate note, at maturity, and made payments on commercial paper. The Company did not invest in significant acquisitions in 2009. Cash used for acquisitions was $655.7 million and $106.0 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The cash used in 2008 relates primarily to the acquisitions of Technical Concepts and Aprica, while cash used in 2007 included the acquisition of Endicia. See Footnote 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Aggregate dividends paid were $71.4 million, $234.5 million and $234.7 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capital expenditures were $153.3 million, $157.8 million and $157.3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The largest single capital project in each of 2009, 2008 and 2007 was the implementation of SAP. The Company purchased noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries for $29.2 million during 2009. Cash used for restructuring activities and cash used to settle foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are included in changes in accrued liabilities and other in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash used for restructuring activities was $84.0 million, $60.9 million and $53.1 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which primarily relates to employee termination benefits. The Company paid approximately $126.6 million to settle foreign exchange contracts on intercompany borrowings and cross currency interest rate swaps during 2009. 28 Table of Contents Financial Position The Company is committed to maintaining a strong financial position through maintaining sufficient levels of available liquidity, managing working capital and monitoring the Companys overall capitalization. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009 were $278.3 million, and the Company had $690.0 million and $188.8 million of borrowing capacity under its Revolver and new receivables facility, respectively. Working capital at December 31, 2009 was $422.6 million compared to $159.7 million at December 31, 2008, and the current ratio at December 31, 2009 was 1.24:1 compared to 1.07:1 at December 31, 2008. The increase in working capital and the current ratio is primarily due to net cash realized from the Companys financing activities and the repayment of current maturities of debt as well as cash flows generated from operating activities. The Company monitors its overall capitalization by evaluating total debt to total capitalization. Total debt to total capital capitalization is defined as the sum of short and long term debt, less cash, divided by the sum of total debt and stockholders equity, less cash. Total debt to total capitalization was .56:1 at December 31, 2009 and .62:1 at December 31, 2008. The Company reduced the quarterly dividend payable on its common stock from $0.21 per share to $0.05 per share during 2009 to enhance its liquidity and to maintain its investment grade credit rating. Over the long term, the Company plans to improve its current ratio and total debt to total capitalization by improving operating results, managing working capital and using cash generated from operations to repay debt maturities. The Company has from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased its debt and taken other steps to reduce its debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve its overall financial position and balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, its cash positions and other considerations, the Company may continue to take such actions. Borrowing Arrangements During 2009, the Company enhanced its liquidity and financial position by completing the issuance of $300.0 million of unsecured and unsubordinated notes and $345.0 million of convertible senior notes. Proceeds from these offerings were used to complete the convertible note hedge transactions and to complete the Tender Offers and for general corporate purposes. In addition, in September 2009 the Company completed a new 364 day receivables facility that provides for borrowings of up to $200.0 million. As of December 31, 2009, $188.8 million was available for borrowing under the new receivables facility, and there were no amounts outstanding. In connection with the completion of the new receivables facility, the Company repaid the $448.0 million floating rate note outstanding under the previous receivables facility. The Companys Revolver expires in November 2012. As of December 31, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver, and the Company had $690.0 million of borrowing capacity (in November 2010, the borrowing capacity is reduced to $665.0 million). In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may use the borrowing capacity under the Revolver to provide the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. However, the Companys current short term debt credit ratings, coupled with continued uncertainty in the credit markets, may preclude it from accessing the commercial paper market. The Revolver also provides for the issuance of up to $100.0 million of standby letters of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. As of December 31, 2009, no commercial paper was outstanding, and there were no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under the Revolver. The indentures governing the Companys medium term and convertible senior notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants. The Companys borrowing arrangements other than the medium term and convertible senior notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants and certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to total capitalization ratios. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had complied with all covenants under the indentures and its other borrowing arrangements, and the Company could access the full borrowing capacity available under the Revolver and the new receivables facility and utilize the $878.8 million for general corporate purposes without exceeding the debt to total capitalization limits in its financial covenants. A failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the Companys ability to borrow under the Revolver and new receivables facility and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of certain indebtedness. Debt The Company has varying needs for short term working capital financing as a result of the seasonal nature of its business. The volume and timing of production impacts the Companys cash flows and has historically involved increased production in the first quarter of the year to meet increased customer demand through the remainder of the year. Working capital fluctuations have historically been financed through short term financing arrangements, such as borrowings under the Revolver or commercial paper supported by the Revolver. 29 Table of Contents Total debt decreased $370.5 million to $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2009 from $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2008. The net decrease was attributable to a $325.0 million reduction in outstanding debt as a result of the completion of the Tender Offers, the repayment of the $448.0 million floating rate note outstanding under the Companys previous receivables facility, a $50.0 million repayment on the Term Loan, as well as the repayment of the remaining $69.9 million principal amount outstanding of the $250.0 million medium term notes due December 2009. These decreases were partially offset by the March 2009 issuance of $300.0 million of medium term notes and $345.0 million of convertible senior notes, which have a carrying value of $284.3 million at December 31, 2009. The December 31, 2009 debt balance was also affected by the mark to market adjustments necessary to record the fair value of interest rate hedges of fixed rate debt, in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance. The mark to market adjustments decreased the carrying value of debt by $43.9 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The Companys 364 day receivables financing facility provides for maximum borrowings of up to $200.0 million, of which $188.8 million was available for borrowing and no amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2009. The completion of the new receivables facility was coincident with the September 2009 repayment of the $448.0 million floating rate note outstanding under the Companys previous receivables facility. In May 2009, the Company completed cash tender offers to repurchase $180.1 million of the $250.0 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of notes due December 2009 and $144.9 million of the $250.0 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of notes due May 2010. In December 2009, the Company repaid the remaining $69.9 million principal amount outstanding of the $250.0 million medium term notes due December 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $493.5 million of short term debt, including $105.1 million of medium term notes that mature in May 2010 and a $100.0 million principal payment due on the Term Loan in September 2010. In addition, because the closing sale price of the Companys common stock exceeded $11.19 for more than 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days in the three months ended December 31, 2009, the convertible senior notes are convertible at the election of the holders of the notes at any time during the three months ended March 31, 2010. Since conversion of the notes is outside the control of the Company, the carrying value of the convertible senior notes, $284.3 million, is classified as current portion of long term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009. Reset Notes In July 1998, the Company issued $250.0 million of medium term notes, maturing in July 2028 with interest payable semiannually (the Reset notes). The Reset notes contained a coupon rate reset feature occurring at two ten year intervals, July 2008 and July 2018. The Reset notes contained a coupon rate of 6.35% through the first interest reset date of July 2008. In addition, the Reset notes contained an embedded remarketing option pursuant to which a third party could call the Reset notes at par at the end of each ten year remarketing interval, and the third party or another securities dealer could remarket the Reset notes at a reset coupon rate which would result in the third party realizing proceeds for the remarketed notes in an amount approximately equal to the discounted present value of a $250.0 million ten year note with a coupon of 5.485%, discounted at the ten year treasury note yield to maturity prevailing at the time of remarketing. In the event the remarketing option at the end of each remarketing interval was not exercised, the Reset note holders were required to put the Reset notes back to the Company at a price of par. The embedded remarketing option was accounted for separately, as it was deemed a purchase by the Company of a transferable, freestanding call option from the Reset note investors and the Companys concurrent transfer of the freestanding call option to the third party. As a result, the remarketing option, which provided for the call and remarketing of the Reset notes, was in effect a contract between the third party and the Reset note holders that allowed the third party to call the Reset notes from the holders at par at the end of each ten year remarketing interval and remarket the Reset notes. The fair value of the remarketing option purchased by the Company from the Reset note investors at the date of issuance was determined based on the amount the third party paid the Company for the remarketing option. In summary, at issuance the Company was cash neutral with respect to the remarketing option but implicitly issued the Reset notes at a premium because the investors purchased the Reset notes from the Company simultaneous with the Company purchasing the remarketing option from the investors (which the Company concurrently monetized by selling it to a third party). As a result, the Reset notes carried a premium at issuance, and the Company recognized no gain or loss upon issuance of the Reset notes. In connection with the issuance of the Reset notes in July 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with the third party that afforded the Company the right to purchase the remarketing option from the third party at the end of each ten year remarketing interval at its then fair value in order to avoid the remarketing of the Reset notes. The Company exercised this right in July 2008 to avoid the third party calling and remarketing the Reset notes. The Company redeemed the $250.0 million of Reset notes in July 2008 because prevailing interest rates as of the July 2008 remarketing date would have resulted in the third party exercising the remarketing 30 Table of Contents option and calling the Reset notes at par, and the Reset notes subsequently being remarketed. The Reset notes would have been remarketed at a premium to par in order for the third party to realize the discounted present value described above in the remarketing. A note priced at a premium to par would carry a coupon rate greater than the rate carried by a security priced at par. Accordingly, the coupon rate arising from a potential remarketing was estimated to approximate 9.0%, exceeding the Companys then incremental borrowing rate of 6.25% for comparable debt. To achieve a lower net cost of borrowing, in July 2008, the Company redeemed the Reset notes and recorded a loss on extinguishment of the Reset notes of $52.2 million associated with the purchase of the embedded remarketing option from the third party. The Company did not have any Reset notes outstanding as of December 31, 2009. Pension Obligations The Company has adopted and sponsors pension plans in the U.S. and in various other countries. The Companys ongoing funding requirements for its pension plans are largely dependent on the value of each of the plans assets and the investment returns realized on plan assets. In 2009, the Company made a $75.0 million voluntary cash contribution to its primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan in order to improve the overall funded status of the plan. The Company expects to contribute approximately $33.0 million to its pension plans in 2010. Future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets. The Company determines its plan asset investment mix, in part, on the duration of each plans liabilities. To the extent each plans assets decline in value or do not generate the returns expected by the Company, the Company may be required to make contributions to the pension plans to ensure the pension obligations are adequately funded as required by law or mandate. Dividends In the first quarter of 2009, the Company reduced the quarterly dividend payable on its common stock from $0.21 per share to $0.05 per share to improve liquidity and maintain its current investment grade credit rating. The payment of dividends to holders of the Companys common stock remains at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Companys financial condition, earnings, legal requirements and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. Credit Ratings The Companys credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. The Companys current senior debt credit ratings from Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings are Baa3, BBB and BBB, respectively. Its current short term debt credit ratings from Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings are P 3, A 3 and F 2, respectively. Standard & Poors has a stable outlook, and Moodys and Fitch maintain a negative outlook on their ratings. Changes in the Companys operating results, cash flows or financial position could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies. The ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Companys securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more detailed discussion of the Companys credit ratings. Outlook For the year ending December 31, 2010, the Company expects to generate cash flows from operations of more than $500.0 million after restructuring cash payments of approximately $70.0 million to $80.0 million. The Company plans to fund capital expenditures of approximately $160.0 million, which include expenditures associated with the implementation of SAP. Overall, the Company believes that available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from future operations, access to capital markets, and availability under the Revolver and new receivables facility will be adequate to support the cash needs of existing businesses. The Company plans to use available cash to repay debt maturities as they come due, including $105.1 million of medium term notes that mature in May 2010 and a $100.0 million principal payment due under the Term Loan in September 2010. Resolution of Income Tax Contingencies In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded $3.1 million, $29.9 million and $41.3 million, respectively, in net income tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with the IRS, the settlement of certain tax contingency reserves, the reversal of a valuation allowance, the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters and the reorganization of certain legal entities in Europe. These benefits are reflected in the Companys 2009, 2008 and 2007 Consolidated Statements of Operations. The ultimate resolution of outstanding tax matters may be different than that reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals, which may adversely impact future operating results and cash flows. 31 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2028. Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of December 31, 2009 and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements. The following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations are expected to have on the Companys cash flow in the indicated period. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2009. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Lessthan1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than 5 Years Debt (1) $ 2,508.8 $ 493.5 $ 517.3 $ 506.2 $ 991.8 Interest on debt (2) 1,165.2 144.5 264.6 244.8 511.3 Operating lease obligations (3) 404.3 96.5 137.7 79.4 90.7 Purchase obligations (4) 414.6 340.9 73.7 Total contractual obligations (5) $ 4,492.9 $ 1,075.4 $ 993.3 $ 830.4 $ 1,593.8 (1) Amounts represent contractual obligations based on the earliest date that the obligation may become due, excluding interest, based on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2009. The carrying value of the $345.0 million of convertible senior notes is included in the table as due within one year since the convertible senior notes are convertible as of December 31, 2009. Provisions of the convertible senior notes entitle the holders to convert their notes during specified periods if certain conditions are met, and since such conditions were met, the convertible senior notes are convertible during the quarter ended March 31, 2010. The convertible senior notes may be convertible in future periods and mature in March 2014 if not earlier converted. For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Amounts represent estimated interest payable on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2009, excluding the impact of interest rate swaps that adjust the fixed rate to a floating rate for $1.0 billion of medium term notes. Interest on floating rate debt was estimated using the rate in effect as of December 31, 2009. For further information, see Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Amounts represent contractual minimum lease obligations on operating leases as of December 31, 2009. For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Primarily consists of purchase commitments entered into as of December 31, 2009 for finished goods, raw materials, components and services pursuant to legally enforceable and binding obligations, which include all significant terms. (5) Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2009 balance sheet as current liabilities, except for current portion of long term debt and short term debt. The Company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits. As a large taxpayer, the Company is under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities on several open tax positions, and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year. While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the $191.6 million in unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, at December 31, 2009 is excluded from the preceding table. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, the Company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table. The timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets, among other factors. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had liabilities related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans of $594.7 million. See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 32 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $59.4 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Companys self insurance programs, including workers compensation, product liability and medical. See Footnote 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2009, the Company did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in that footnote, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections describe the Companys critical accounting policies. Sales Recognition Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership change, which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms. Sales are net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other sales related discounts. Recovery of Accounts Receivable The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. When aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience. Accounts are reviewed for potential write off on a case by case basis. Accounts deemed uncollectible are written off, net of expected recoveries. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Companys estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted. Inventory Reserves The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Provisions for excess and obsolete inventories, including shrink reserves, totaled $57.0 million, $79.0 million and $41.8 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are included in cost of products sold. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets The Company performs its impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level, and all of the Companys goodwill is assigned to the Companys reporting units. Reporting units are one level below the operating segment level. In connection with the Companys realignment of its businesses under a Global Business Unit (GBU) structure, the Company redefined its reporting units, where necessary, to align with the GBU structure effective January 1, 2009. Reporting units in the Office Products segment and certain reporting units in the Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products segment that were geographically aligned were impacted by the realignment. The goodwill of these geographically aligned reporting units was reallocated to reporting units defined under the GBU structure on a relative fair value basis. The Company has not had any other material changes to the reporting units identified and used to test goodwill for impairment since January 1, 2006 due to restructuring activities or otherwise. Acquired businesses, including goodwill arising from such transactions, are integrated into the Companys existing reporting units. After the realignment of the reporting units and the reallocation of goodwill, the Company had 13 reporting units with total goodwill of $2.7 billion as of January 1, 2009. Five of the Companys 13 reporting units accounted for approximately 70% of the Companys total goodwill. These five reporting units were as follows: Baby & Parenting Essentials; Rubbermaid Commercial Products; Industrial Products & Services; Markers, Highlighters, Art & Office Organization; and Office Technology. The Company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process. The Company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. For example, if macroeconomic factors, such as 33 Table of Contents consumer demand and consumer confidence, deteriorate materially such that the Companys reporting units projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates, the Company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired. The Company determined that no interim tests of impairment were necessary during 2009, due to declining macroeconomic conditions, significant reductions in reporting units expected sales and profitability, or otherwise. In the Companys goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, impairment may be present. Estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing can impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the impairment charge to the extent one is recorded. The Company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing, each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value. For the Companys reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows, the Company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess their fair value. The material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year is based on the Companys internal forecasting process. To determine the EBITDA multiple, the Company obtains information from third parties on EBITDA multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses. The Company evaluates the EBITDA multiples used for the reporting units relative to the Companys market capitalization plus an equity control premium. The equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to the Companys market value, with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of the Company. The Company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium. The EBITDA multiple observed in the marketplace for recent transactions ranged from 9 to 11 for the annual impairment test as of July 1, 2009. For the July 1, 2009 impairment test, the Company adjusted the EBITDA multiples from the observed multiples, generally to multiples ranging from 6 to 12 so that the aggregate value of all reporting units relative to the Companys total market value resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium. The Company considers several factors in estimating the EBITDA multiple applicable to each reporting unit, including the reporting units market position, brand awareness, gross and operating margins, and prospects for growth, among other factors. After adjusting the EBITDA multiples for the reporting units, no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used. Furthermore, the Companys equity market value at July 1, 2009 of approximately $3.0 billion was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders equity of approximately $1.8 billion. For the impairment test as of July 1, 2009, if each reporting units EBITDA multiple were reduced by 0.5 from the 6 to 12 multiple used for each reporting unit, all reporting units where the EBITDA multiple approach was used to value the reporting unit would have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test. The Company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances, such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned, is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market, has experienced significant losses, is in a stage of hyper growth, is executing significant restructuring efforts, or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies. The Company used the discounted cash flow approach to value three of its reporting units for the annual impairment test as of July 1, 2009, Industrial Products & Services, Everyday Writing and Fine Writing, because these reporting units are executing significant restructuring projects or the reporting units financial results are significantly impacted by economic cycles. The material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the future financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit, the discount rate, and the working capital investment required. Estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates, raw material costs, currency fluctuations, and operating efficiencies to be realized. The Company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable risk adjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit. In using the discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in 2009, the Company generally used average compound long term sales growth rates ranging from 2% to 3%, average operating margins ranging from 13% to 26%, and discount rates ranging from 11% to 12%. The Company concluded these three reporting units passed step one of the goodwill impairment test based on the values determined using the discounted cash flow approach. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company measures the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, based on the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill. The Company identifies unrecognized intangible assets, such as trade names and customer relationships, and uses discounted cash flow models to estimate the values of the reporting units recognized and unrecognized intangible assets. The estimated values of the reporting units intangible assets and net tangible assets are deducted from the reporting units total fair value to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. If the discount rates used to estimate the fair value of the Industrial Products & Services, Everyday Writing and Fine Writing reporting units increased 100 basis points, the estimated fair values of the reporting units would have declined by $63 million, $63 million, and $30 million, respectively. If the discount rates were increased by 100 basis points, all three reporting units would still have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test. 34 Table of Contents The Company has one reporting unit, Baby & Parenting Essentials, whose estimated fair value at July 1, 2009 exceeded net assets by less than 10% of the reporting units net assets using the adjusted EBITDA multiple or discounted cash flow value, as applicable. The Baby & Parenting Essentials reporting unit has goodwill of $416 million as of July 1, 2009. If the EBITDA multiple used to estimate the fair value of Baby & Parenting Essentials reporting unit were reduced by 1.0, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have been approximately 1% less than the net assets of the reporting unit. Additional valuation procedures would have been required to determine whether Baby & Parenting Essentials goodwill was impaired, and to the extent goodwill was impaired, the magnitude of the impairment charge. The Company continues to implement specific restructuring projects and business and operational strategies to further strengthen the profitability of Baby & Parenting Essentials. The Company continues to monitor whether these initiatives are being executed as planned and improve its financial performance. To the extent the Company is not successful in implementing these projects and strategies, it is possible the Company would record goodwill impairment charges associated with Baby & Parenting Essentials in future periods. Baby & Parenting Essentials has been adversely impacted by recently enacted child safety legislation in North America and continues to integrate two acquired international businesses. Baby & Parenting Essentials has undertaken and is executing restructuring projects to reduce supply chain costs and administrative overhead worldwide and has taken steps to minimize the impact inflation has on its operating results, and to reduce inventories. These efforts are being taken to reduce the working capital investment required in the short term and improve profitability over the mid to long term. The Companys indefinite lived intangible assets totaled $320 million as of July 1, 2009. The Company assesses the fair value of its indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were the Company to license the use of the trademark or trade name. An impairment charge for indefinite lived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date. The Company completed its annual impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets as of July 1, 2009 and concluded none of the assets were impaired. The Company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date, such as whether the Company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade names. Based on consideration of these factors, the Company determined that no impairment indicators have been present, and therefore, impairment testing as of a date other than July 1, 2009 is not required. See Footnote 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the Companys customer base and net sales, a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers or sustained declines in the Companys market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders equity. The Company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the Company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present. Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes costs associated with internal use software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the Companys management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development. Capitalized internal use software costs include: (i) external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software; (ii) payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project; and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing the software. Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose. The Company expenses as incurred research and development, general and administrative, and indirect costs associated with internal use software. In addition, the Company expenses as incurred training, maintenance and other internal use software costs incurred during the post implementation stage. Costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internal use software are only capitalized if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software. Capitalized software costs were $185.9 million at December 31, 2009. Capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of December 31, 2009. The Company amortizes internal use software costs using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which typically ranges from three to 12 years. Capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used. Impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values. 35 Table of Contents Other Long Lived Assets The Company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment and other long lived assets are present. These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group. If impairment indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount. The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses, working capital, and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the Companys strategic plan. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the product line level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available. Product Liability Reserves The Company has a self insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance. The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves. The Companys actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the Companys product liability reserve. The Company has product liability reserves of $47.3 million as of December 31, 2009. While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company, and such additional losses may be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal and Environmental Reserves The Company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, as well as contract and other disputes. The Company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters. The estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. No insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the Companys cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Companys cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to long term operations and maintenance Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability (CERCLA) matters which are estimated at present value. The Companys estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of December 31, 2009 ranged between $10.7 million and $26.9 million. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had a reserve of $15.5 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate, which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Income Taxes In accordance with relevant authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized. No provision is made for the U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested. The Companys income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. For uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. The Companys ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Companys effective tax rate as well as impact operating results. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 36 Table of Contents Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. The primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates, health care cost trend rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and rate of compensation increases, as discussed below: Discount rates: The Company generally estimates the discount rate for its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using an iterative process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The Company believes this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities. Health care cost trend rate: The Companys health care cost trend rate is based on historical retiree cost data, near term health care outlook, and industry benchmarks and surveys. Expected return on plan assets: The Companys expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and historical and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes. The Companys analysis gives consideration to historical returns and long term, prospective rates of return. Mortality rates: Mortality rates are based on actual and projected plan experience. Rate of compensation increase: The rate of compensation increases reflects the Companys long term actual experience and its outlook, including consideration of expected rates of inflation. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the Companys pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense. See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the assumptions used. The following tables summarize the Companys pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009 (in millions): U.S. International Pension plan assets and obligations, net: Prepaid benefit cost $ $ 3.5 Accrued current benefit cost (11.7 ) (4.0) Accrued noncurrent benefit cost (322.2 ) (88.7) Net liability recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet $ (333.9 ) $ (89.2) U.S. Other postretirement benefit obligations: Accrued current benefit cost $ (16.0) Accrued noncurrent benefit cost (152.1) Liability recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet $ (168.1) The following table summarizes the net pre tax cost associated with pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Net pension cost $ 18.1 $ 18.3 $ 14.4 Net postretirement benefit costs 8.7 8.8 10.1 Total $ 26.8 $ 27.1 $ 24.5 37 Table of Contents The Company used weighted average discount rates of 6.2% and 6.3% to determine the expenses for 2009 for the pension and postretirement plans, respectively. The Company used a weighted average expected return on assets of 7.3% to determine the expense for the pension plans for 2009. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension and postretirement plan expenses, holding all other assumptions constant (in millions): Impact on 2009 Expense 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$0.9 25 basis point increase in discount rate $0.5 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$2.6 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $2.6 The total projected benefit obligations of the Companys pension and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2009 were $1.41 billion and $168.1 million, respectively. The Company used weighted average discount rates of 5.7% and 5.8% to determine the projected benefit obligations for the pension and postretirement plans, respectively, as of December 31, 2009. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the projected benefit obligation for the pension and postretirement plans, holding all other assumptions constant (in millions): December 31, 2009 Impact on PBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$49.1 25 basis point increase in discount rate $46.6 The Company has $418.4 million (after tax) of net unrecognized pension and other postretirement losses ($625.1 million pre tax) included as a reduction to stockholders equity at December 31, 2009. The unrecognized gains and losses primarily result from changes to life expectancies and other actuarial assumptions, changes in discount rates as well as actual returns on plan assets being more or less than expected. The unrecognized gain (loss) for each plan is amortized to expense over the average life of each plan. The net amount amortized to expense totaled $7.3 million (pre tax) in 2009, and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future. Changes in actuarial assumptions, actual returns on plan assets and changes in the actuarially determined average life of the plans impact the amount of unrecognized gain (loss) recognized as expense annually. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance changing the way entities account for securitizations and other transfers of financial instruments. In addition to increased disclosure, this guidance eliminates the concept of qualifying special purpose entities and changes the test for consolidation of variable interest entities. This guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2010. The adoption of the authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. International Operations For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Companys non U.S. businesses accounted for approximately 30%, 31% and 28% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Changes in both U.S. and non U.S. net sales are shown below for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 % Change 2008 vs. 2007 % Change U.S. $ 3,881.4 $ 4,447.2 $ 4,624.3 (12.7 )% (3.8)% Non U.S 1,696.2 2,023.4 1,783.0 (16.2 ) 13.5 $ 5,577.6 $ 6,470.6 $ 6,407.3 (13.8 )% 1.0% The Companys Office Products segment has operations in Venezuela, and the primary currency used by the Venezuelan operations to transact business is the Venezuelan Bolivar. Through December 1, 2009, the Company used the official exchange rate in Venezuela to translate its Venezuelan operations financial statements into U.S. Dollars, and using the official exchange rate, the Venezuelan operations generated net sales of approximately $65 million and operating income of approximately $25 million in 2009. Based on 38 Table of Contents the challenges the Company has faced in repatriating Venezuelan earnings to the U.S. and other facts and circumstances, the Company adopted the parallel rate to translate its Venezuelan financial statements into U.S. Dollars effective December 1, 2009. In December 2009, the parallel exchange rate of Venezuelan Bolivars to U.S. Dollars was approximately three times the official rate. Due solely to the change in exchange rates used to translate Venezuelan Bolivar financial statements in December 2009 (i) net assets, including cash, declined approximately $30 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and (ii) the Companys 2010 sales and operating income are anticipated to decline an estimated 1% and 3%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 due to the translation of the Venezuelan Bolivar at the parallel rate. Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuelas economy has been characterized as highly inflationary because three year cumulative inflation has exceeded 100%. As a result, changes in the U.S. Dollar value of the Companys Venezuelan Bolivar net assets attributable to fluctuations in the parallel rate will be recorded as gains or losses in the statement of operations rather than in other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is a market based measurement, not an entity specific measurement, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Various valuation techniques exist for measuring fair value, including the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). These valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Companys market assumptions. The authoritative accounting guidance for fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for similar or identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions. The Companys assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value at least annually are its money market fund investments, included in cash and cash equivalents; mutual fund investments, included in other assets; and derivative instruments, primarily included in other assets, other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, and these assets and liabilities are therefore subject to the measurement and disclosure requirements outlined in the authoritative guidance. The Company determines the fair value of its money market fund investments based on the values of the underlying assets (Level 2) and its mutual fund investments based on quoted market prices (Level 1). The Company generally uses derivatives for hedging purposes, and the Companys derivatives are primarily foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. The Company determines the fair value of its derivative instruments based on Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 fair value determinations are derived from directly or indirectly observable (market based) information. Forward Looking Statements Forward looking statements in this Report are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward looking statements may relate to, but are not limited to, information or assumptions about the effects of sales (including pricing), income/(loss), earnings per share, operating income or gross margin improvements or declines, Project Acceleration, capital and other expenditures, working capital, cash flow, dividends, capital structure, debt to capitalization ratios, availability of financing, interest rates, restructuring, impairment and other charges, potential losses on divestitures, impact of changes in accounting standards, pending legal proceedings and claims (including environmental matters), future economic performance, costs and cost savings (including raw material and sourced product inflation, productivity and streamlining), synergies, managements plans, goals and objectives for future operations, performance and growth or the assumptions relating to any of the forward looking statements. These statements generally are accompanied by words such as intend, anticipate, believe, estimate, project, target, plan, expect, will, should, would or similar statements. The Company cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees because there are inherent difficulties in predicting future results. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the Companys dependence on the strength of retail, commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in light of the global economic slowdown; currency fluctuations; competition with other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products; major retailers strong bargaining power; changes in the prices of raw materials and sourced products and the Companys ability to obtain raw materials and sourced products in a timely manner from suppliers; the Companys ability to develop innovative new products and to develop, maintain and strengthen its end user brands; the Companys ability to expeditiously close facilities and move operations while managing foreign regulations and other impediments; the Companys ability to manage successfully risks associated with divesting or discontinuing businesses and product lines; the Companys ability to implement successfully information technology solutions throughout its organization; the Companys ability to improve productivity and streamline operations; the Companys ability to refinance short term debt on terms acceptable to it, particularly given the uncertainties in the global credit markets; changes to the Companys credit ratings; significant increases in the funding obligations related to the Companys pension plans due to declining asset values or otherwise; the imposition of tax liabilities greater than the Companys provisions for such matters; significant increases in costs to comply with changes in legal, employment, tax, environmental and other laws and regulations; the risks inherent in the Companys foreign operations and those matters set forth in this Report generally and Item 1A to this Report. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and assessed all of the factors affecting the Company or that the publicly available and other information the Company receives with respect to these factors is complete or correct. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The Companys market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices. Pursuant to the Companys policies, natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in rates and prices. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rates Interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floating rate debt. The Company manages its interest rate exposure through its mix of fixed and floating rate debt and its conservative debt ratio target. Interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate the Companys exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. Accordingly, benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt, which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements. Interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions, and for qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense. Excluding debt for which a fixed rate has been swapped for a floating rate, fixed rate debt represented approximately 45.0% of the Companys $2.51 billion of total debt as of December 31, 2009. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business since a portion of the Companys sales, expenses and operating transactions is conducted on a global basis in various foreign currencies. To the extent that business transactions are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity entering into the transaction, the Company is exposed to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Companys foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less. The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts as economic hedges for commercial transactions and to offset the future impact of gains and losses resulting from changes in the expected amount of functional currency cash flows to be received or paid upon settlement of the anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transactions. Gains and losses related to the settlement of qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions. The Company also uses natural hedging techniques such as offsetting or netting like foreign currency flows and denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency. The Company also incurs gains and losses recorded within shareholders equity due to the translation of the financial statements from the functional currency of its subsidiaries to U.S. Dollars. The Company utilizes capital structures of foreign subsidiaries combined with forward contracts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency risk. The Company may hedge portions of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans, with forward contracts and cross currency hedges. Gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange contracts and cross currency hedges, which are generally used to hedge intercompany loans and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). Commodity Prices The Company purchases certain raw materials, including resin, corrugate, steel, stainless steel, aluminum and other metals, which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors. The Companys resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene and polypropylene in roughly equal quantities. While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, a variety of programs, including periodic raw material purchases, purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the Company address this risk. Where practical, the Company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process. Financial Instruments In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps. Derivatives were recorded at fair value in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009 as follows (in millions): Prepaid expenses and other $ 1.3 Other assets 20.9 Other accrued liabilities (1.5 ) Other noncurrent liabilities (2.5 ) See Footnote 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on derivatives. 40 Table of Contents Value at Risk The amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the Company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model. The value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variance/covariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures (specifically excluding equity method investments). The fair value losses shown in the table below represent the Companys estimate of the maximum loss that could arise in one day. The amounts presented in the table are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. The following table sets forth the one day value at risk as of and for the year ended December 31, ( in millions, except percentages): Market Risk (1) 2009 Average December 31, 2009 2008 Average December 31, 2008 Confidence Level Interest rates $ 12.2 $ 9.6 $ 12.2 $ 9.6 95% Foreign exchange $ 12.8 $ 12.3 $ 8.9 $ 15.3 95% (1) The Company generally does not enter into material derivative contracts for commodities; therefore, commodity price risk is not shown because the amounts are not material. The year over year decrease in the end of year value at risk in foreign exchange is primarily due to reduced volatility in foreign exchange rates in late 2009 as well as declines in overall currency exposures. The 95% confidence interval signifies the Companys degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the Companys favor. The value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse. Actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is highly unlikely that the Company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time. Additionally, since the Company operates globally, and therefore, among a broad basket of currencies, its foreign currency exposure is diversified. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. 41 Table of Contents
