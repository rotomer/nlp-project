On December 22, 2003 the Group exchanged its 80% stake in BCC/Clearnet and its 17.7% interest in LCH for 49.1% of LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. Simultaneously, Euronext sold 7.6% of these shares to third parties. The Groups 41.5% interest in LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. is divided into ordinary shares (24.9%) and Redeemable Convertible Preference Shares (16.6%). Euronext recorded a gain on disposal of discontinued operation of 175 million in connection with the transaction. As from December 22, 2003, Euronext no longer records clearing revenues, but instead accounts for its interest in LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. under the equity method, recording its share of income under Income from associates. 84 Table of Contents (2) On July 22, 2005, Euronext formed Atos Euronext Market Solutions as a continuation and expansion of its pre existing Atos Euronext relationship with Atos Origin. The main assets Euronext contributed were the activities of LIFFE Market Solutions, the information technology division of its derivatives trading business Euronext.liffe, and its 50% stake in Atos Euronext. Atos Origin contributed its own 50% share in Atos Euronext, plus other major assets from market related businesses, including middle and back office solutions, and its 51% stake in the connectivity platform Bourse Connect. The transfer of the activities of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS led to a significant reduction in Euronexts salaries and employee benefit costs, consultancy expenses, other office, telecom and consultancy costs and depreciation charges, and a parallel increase in IT expenses, which from the date of creation of AEMS include all IT expenses related to Euronext.liffe. (3) On 18 November 2005, Euronext and Borsa S.p.A, through MBE Holding S.p.A, 51 % owned by Euronext and 49 % by Borsa italiana S.p.A, subscribed to a controlling 51 % interest in MTSs share capital. The remaining MTS shares were subject to a pre emptive rights subscription and sale mechanism first between the historical shareholders and MTS dealers, where the latter became new shareholders, and subsequently to MBE Holding S.p.A. As a result of the pre emptive rights and sale mechanism, MBE Holding S.p.A. was committed to acquire as at 31 December 2005 an additional stake in MTS leading to a 60.37% ownership of MTS by MBE Holding S.p.A. Such an acquisition has been realized in February 2006. In IFRS, as MBE Holding S.p.A. is jointly controlled by Euronext (51%) and Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (49%), Euronext consolidates proportionally 51% of MTS consolidated assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Groups proportionate ownership percentage is 30.79% and a minority interests of 20.21% is therefore accounted for. In US GAAP, MBE Holding is accounted for under the equity method. (4) In January 2006, Euronext completed the sale of the Belgian central securities depository CIK N.V./SA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Euronext Brussels, to Euroclear. In exchange for this asset, Euronext received an additional 0.4% stake in Euroclear. (5) As from January 1, 2005, the Group no longer amortizes goodwill relating to acquisitions made before March 31, 2004 as part of a business combination, in line with IFRS 3. (6) Dividends declared with respect to 2005 consist of a 1 per share ordinary dividend. In addition, a 3 per share capital reduction was made. 85 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF NYSE GROUP The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of NYSE Group and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document. The following discussion contains forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. See Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. Certain prior period amounts presented in the discussion and analysis have been reclassified to conform to the 2006 presentation. Overview NYSE Group was organized on May 2, 2005. As of December 31, 2005 and up until March 7, 2006, NYSE Group had no assets (other than $200 it received on December 29, 2005 from the sale of one share of its common stock to each of the NYSE and Archipelago) and had not conducted any material activities other than those incidental to its formation. However, on March 7, 2006, upon the consummation of the merger of the NYSE and Archipelago, NYSE Group became the parent company of the NYSE and Archipelago. Basis of Presentation NYSE Group has treated the merger of the NYSE and Archipelago as a purchase business combination for accounting purposes, with the NYSE designated as the business and accounting acquirer. As a result, the historical results of the NYSE have become the historical results of NYSE Group, as its successor. The results of operations of NYSE Arca have been included in the results of operations of NYSE Group since March 8, 2006. Recent Developments On April 26, 2007, NYSE Euronext announced NYSE Groups unaudited financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2007. The revenues for this period were $702.0 million (inclusive of activity assessment fees of $185.6 million), an increase of $247.1 million, or 54.3%, from revenues of $454.9 million (inclusive of activity assessment fees of $139.2 million) for the comparable period a year ago. Due to the fact that the combination between NYSE Group and Euronext N.V. was consummated on April 4, 2007, first quarter 2007 results included the full quarter results from the operations of NYSE Group only; the operations of Euronext are not included in the first quarter results of NYSE Group. First quarter 2007 results included $11.1 million in merger expenses consisting of professional and other fees incurred in connection with both the acquisition of the Archipelago businesses and the recently completed combination with Euronext N.V. ($4.6 million), and exit costs associated with the previously announced trading floor consolidation ($6.5 million). Also included in the first quarter results was a $12.8 million curtailment gain related to the elimination of certain employee post retirement benefits. This non recurring gain partially offset $15.2 million in charges incurred by NYSE Group for the routing of customer orders from the NYSE to other market centers for the period from January 2 through March 2, 2007. Commencing March 5, 2007, consistent with industry practice, the NYSE implemented new routing fees to mitigate the expenses incurred from other market centers. As a result, NYSE Group reported net income of $67.6 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2007, an increase of $37.3 million, or 123%, compared to net income of $30.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the comparable period a year ago. 86 Table of Contents Business Development NYSE/Archipelago Merger On April 20, 2005, the NYSE entered into a definitive merger agreement with Archipelago, pursuant to which the NYSE and Archipelago agreed to combine their businesses and became wholly owned subsidiaries of NYSE Group, a newly created, for profit and publicly traded holding company. The merger closed on March 7, 2006. As of that date, the NYSE and Archipelago became wholly owned subsidiaries of NYSE Group. Selling Shareholder Offering On May 10, 2006, NYSE Group completed a selling shareholder offering of 28.75 million shares of common stock at $61.50 per share, for which NYSE Group received no proceeds. Combination with Euronext N.V. On May 22, 2006, NYSE Group proposed a business combination with Euronext to create NYSE Euronext. Euronext is a cross border exchange providing international services for regulated cash markets and derivative markets in Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Portugal. Both parties signed a definitive combination agreement on June 1, 2006, which was amended and restated on November 24, 2006. The combination closed on April 4, 2007. Purchase of Minority Interest in SIAC On November 1, 2006, NYSE Group completed the purchase of the one third ownership stake in SIAC previously held by AMEX for approximately $40.3 million, as a result of which NYSE Group now fully owns SIAC. Consolidate Member Regulation Operations On November 28, 2006, NYSE Group and NASD announced the signing of a letter of intent to consolidate each of their member regulation operations into an SRO that will be the private sector regulator for all securities broker dealers doing business with the public in the United States. The transaction is not expected to have material financial consequences for NYSE Group. The new SRO, which will be named at a later date, is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2007. MatchPoint Trading, Inc. On July 17, 2006, NYSE Group acquired MatchPoint Trading Inc. (MatchPoint), a financial services technology company specializing in call market trading and technologies. Marco Polo Network Inc. On September 18, 2006, NYSE Group announced that it had acquired an equity stake in Marco Polo Network Inc. (Marco Polo). Through its local exchange and brokerage relationships, Marco Polo offers intra market connectivity and routing to brokers and exchanges in more than 40 emerging markets. TransactTools, Inc. On January 8, 2007, NYSE Group acquired TransactTools Inc. (TransactTools), a company providing enterprise messaging solutions for the securities trading industry. Tokyo Stock Exchange On January 31, 2007, NYSE Group and Tokyo Stock Exchange signed a letter of intent that establishes a strategic alliance between the two world financial market leaders to jointly develop and explore new opportunities in trading systems and technology, investor and issuer services, investment products, and governance and regulation. 87 Table of Contents National Stock Exchange of India Limited On April 4, 2007, NYSE Group acquired a 5% equity position in the Mumbai based National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE), the maximum investment permitted by any investor in a stock exchange under the securities regulations of India. NYSE Group purchased the shares of NSE for $115.0 million in cash from a consortium of selling shareholders. Business Environment In recent years, the business environment in which NYSE Group operates has been characterized by challenging business and economic conditions. Ongoing regulatory developments, increasing scrutiny of execution costs, unbundling of financial services and enhancements in trading and trade processing technology have created an unprecedented level of competition in the provision of trade execution and related services. In addition, changes in market related legislation have affected the capital raising process in the United States and abroad. The business environment in which NYSE Group operates has been characterized by the following trends: increased global competition; greater emphasis on faster and more cost efficient trade execution; increased demand for transparency and stronger corporate growth; growth in trade volumes; and regulatory developments, including Regulation NMS. This environment has affected NYSE Groups business and the components of its results of operations, and is likely to affect the NYSE Groups results to varying degrees in the future. In particular, these business, economic, regulatory and competitive conditions affect: overall trading volume in NYSE Group listed securities; the prices that NYSE Group can charge its member organizations for trade execution and other trade related services provided by NYSE Group; domestic and non U.S. companies decisions to raise capital through an issuance of shares that would be listed on the markets operated by NYSE Group; and whether companies that are listed on another market will transfer their listing to the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc or whether listed companies will remain listed on the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc. For more concerning these trends and developments, see Item 1. Business Market Trends and Developments. Segment Reporting Subsequent to the merger between the NYSE and Archipelago and the minority interest purchase of SIAC, NYSE Group operates under two reportable segments: Market and Regulation. NYSE Groups segments are managed and operated as two business units and organized based on services provided to customers. Market represents primarily the fees earned from: (i) obtaining new listings and servicing existing listings on the NYSE and NYSE Arca, Inc.; (ii) providing access to trade execution; (iii) distributing market information to data subscribers; (iv) issuing trading licenses (previously membership fees); and (v) providing communication and data processing operations via SIAC. Regulation provides regulatory services (including member firm regulation, market surveillance, enforcement, listed company compliance, and arbitration), performed by NYSE Regulation, to the NYSE and to NYSE Arca. Regulatory fees are paid by member organizations and are primarily assessed based upon their Gross FOCUS revenues. In addition, Regulation collects fines that are assessed against members, member organizations and their employees in disciplinary actions brought by Regulation. 88 Table of Contents Operating Data (unaudited) NYSE Group revenues are affected by many factors, including the number of companies listed on the NYSE and NYSE Arca, Inc. (both new and continuing), corporate actions by these companies (for example, stock splits and mergers), trading activity, demand for data processing, and demand for market information. The following table presents selected operating data for the periods presented. A description of the manner in which the NYSE and NYSE Arca calculate their trading volumes and other operating measures is set forth below.

The consolidated tape refers to the collection of market data that multiple markets make available on a consolidated basis. (10) Gross FOCUS revenues represent a fee of $0.42 per $1,000, of gross revenues generated by member broker dealers as reported on their FOCUS report (a report that is required to be filed with the NYSE). A member broker dealers regulatory fee is based on the revenues reported. The NYSE records revenue on a six month lag; the data is provided on this basis. Sources of Revenues Activity Assessment Fees The NYSE and NYSE Arca, Inc. pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These Section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. NYSE Group, in turn, collects activity assessment fees from member organizations executing trades on the NYSE and NYSE Arca, Inc. and recognizes these amounts when invoiced. Fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees. As a result, neither the size of activity assessment fees or the Section 31 fees has an impact on NYSE Groups net income. Transaction NYSE Prior to August 1, 2006, on the NYSE, trading fees were paid by member organizations based on their trading activity. Fees were assessed on a per share basis for trading in equity securities. The fees applied to all transactions that took place on the NYSE, and the fee amounts varied, based on the size and type of trade consummated. There was no fee for small electronic trades. All members and member organizations paid trading fees except those $2 brokers who effect transactions only for other member organizations and specialists. There were two caps that applied to the trading fees (other than fees for trading ETFs), and member organizations paid the lesser of these two fee caps on a monthly basis. The first cap was a maximum fixed dollar amount of $600,000 per month. The second was a variable cap equal to 2% of the net commissions that a member organization earned on the trades it executed on the trading floor. As a result of these caps, prior to August 1, 2006, fluctuations in trading volumes, regardless of direction or magnitude, did not have a significant impact on NYSE Groups trading fees. 90 Table of Contents NYSE Arca On NYSE Arca, trading fees are charged to customers for trade execution of equity securities and equity options. NYSE Arca earns transaction fees for (i) customer orders of equity securities matched internally on NYSE Arca, as well as for customer orders routed out, and (ii) customer orders of equity options traded or cleared through NYSE Arca. For equity securities, NYSE Arca charges a per share fee to each customer that executes against a buy order or sell order posted internally. NYSE Arca refers to these customers when they purchase or sell securities as liquidity takers, as they removed liquidity from NYSE Arca. A liquidity taker may be either a purchaser or a seller, and is distinguished from a liquidity provider generally by the type of buy order or sell order it posts on NYSE Arca. NYSE Arca also charges a per share fee to customers whose orders of equity securities are routed out to an external market center displaying the best buy order or sell order in the market for a particular security. Price Changes On August 1, 2006, October 1, 2006 and November 30, 2006, NYSE Group implemented transaction pricing changes for NYSE listed equities and NYSE Arca, Inc. traded options. Currently, pricing for NYSE listed equities includes, but is not limited to, the following: Transaction fees on NYSE listed equities traded on the NYSE are based on a fixed rate of $0.000275 per share. Fees for ETF system orders traded on the NYSE under 5,100 shares continue to be waived. Specialists do not incur transaction fees for trading ETFs on the NYSE. NYSE Arcas rates for trading NYSE listed securities are as follows: (i) the rate for removing liquidity from NYSE Arca increased from $0.001 per share to $0.003 per share; and (ii) NYSE Arca rebates $0.002 per share for the provision of liquidity. These fees are consistent with those NYSE Arca charges for trading Nasdaq and Amex listed securities. In addition, as of March 5, 2007, for orders pertaining to NYSE listed equities that are routed to other market centers for execution, the NYSE charges a rate of $0.0025 per share. Currently, pricing for NYSE Arca, Inc. traded options includes, but is not limited to, the following: transaction fees for Market Makers are $0.16 per contract; transaction fees for Lead Market Makers are $0.09 per contract; and transaction fees for Electronic Broker Dealer transactions are $0.50 per contract. In addition, the rate schedule for electronic executions in penny pilot issues will credit trading participants for providing liquidity by providing resting orders/quotes and assess a per contract fee to trading participants that take liquidity. Credits will be as high as $0.30 per contract and fees will be as high as $0.50 per contract. In addition, as a component of the November 30, 2006 announced pricing changes, the NYSE will implement a revenue sharing program, commencing June 1, 2007, that will provide variable payments to specialist firms depending on performance. See Components of Expenses Liquidity Payments for a discussion of revenue sharing programs. The pricing structures of the NYSE and NYSE Arca continue to undergo a fundamental examination as part of a broad strategic review of the NYSE Groups opportunities for revenue growth and efficiency improvement and to better capture value for the services rendered by aligning more closely transaction revenue with executed volume, product expansion and new product development. Transaction fees that NYSE Group earns in the future could also depend on the outcome of certain regulations and rule changes, such as Regulation NMS. 91 Table of Contents Listing Companies pay listing fees when they initially list on the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc., and annually thereafter. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and other corporate action related fees. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of securities that the company initially lists with the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new securities to be listed on the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc., such as stock splits, rights issues, sales of additional securities, and mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee. Annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding securities of the listed company at the end of the previous year. Non U.S. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the United States. Annual fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original listing fees are recognized on a straight line basis over estimated service periods of 10 years for the NYSE and 5 years for NYSE Arca. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Data Processing SIAC charges data processing fees to customers other than NYSE Group (fees charged to NYSE Group are eliminated in consolidation) for communication services, data processing operations and systems development functions. SIACs core business operates on a cost recovery model driven by its customers demands. Under this model, any increase or decrease in SIACs operating expenses results in a corresponding change in its revenues. In addition, SIAC earns revenues through its subsidiary, Sector, which offers an array of communications and data processing services, primarily to the broker dealer community. Market Data NYSE Group collects market information fees principally for consortium based data products and, to a lesser extent, for NYSE proprietary data products. Consortium based data fees are determined by securities industry plans. Consortium based data revenues that coordinated market data distribution generates (net of administration costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of their respective percentage of trades. Last sale prices and quotes in NYSE listed securities are disseminated through Tape A, which constitutes the majority of the NYSEs revenues from consortium based market data revenues. NYSE Group also receives a share of the revenues from Tape B and Tape C, which represents data related to trading of certain securities (including ETFs) that are listed on AMEX, other regional exchanges and Nasdaq. These revenues are influenced by demand for the data by professional and non professional subscribers, as well as NYSE Groups share of trades. In addition, NYSE Group receives fees for television broadcasts, vendor access and other usage fees related to use of data. NYSE Group proprietary products make available market data covering activity that takes place solely on the NYSE and NYSE Arcas markets, independent of activity on other markets. Regulatory Regulatory fees are principally comprised of member regulation fees and market surveillance fees collected by NYSE Group. Member regulation fees are based on a percentage of member organizations gross FOCUS revenues, specifically $0.42 per $1,000 of gross revenues generated by member broker dealers and reported on a six month lag basis. In addition, member regulation fees include initial and annual maintenance fees for branch office registration and registered persons and testing fees. Market surveillance fees are charged to specialists and floor brokers to recover some of the costs of overseeing trading on the NYSE floor. Licensing, Facility and Other For fiscal 2006, NYSE Group sold 1,274 trading licenses at an annual price of $49,290. For fiscal 2007, NYSE Group sold 1,065 trading licenses at an annual price of $50,000 per license. The NYSE had made available a maximum of 1,366 trading licenses. 92 Table of Contents Facility and other fees primarily comprise fees received for services provided to specialists, brokers and clerks physically located on the NYSE floor that enable them to engage in the purchase and sale of securities on the trading floor. These services include booth and post space, communication, trading analysis and technology. Components of Expenses Section 31 Fees See Sources of Revenues Activity Assessment Fees above. Merger Expenses and Exit Costs Merger expenses and exit costs consist of severance costs, curtailment losses, depreciation charges related to the acceleration of certain fixed asset useful lives, as well as legal and other expenses directly attributable either to the merger between the NYSE and Archipelago or the pending combination transaction with Euronext. It also includes legal, printing and accounting fees incurred in connection with the May 2006 selling shareholder offering of our common stock as this was a condition of the Archipelago merger. Compensation NYSE Groups compensation expense includes employee salaries, incentive compensation (including stock based compensation) and related benefits expense, including pension, medical, post retirement medical, and supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) charges. Part time help, primarily related to security personnel at the NYSE, is also recorded as part of compensation. Liquidity Payments To enhance the liquidity of its system, NYSE Arca pays a small fee per share to participants, referred to as liquidity providers, that post buy orders and sell orders on NYSE Arca, when the quote is executed against by liquidity takers purchasing or selling securities internally on NYSE Arca. In addition, effective December 1, 2006, the NYSE implemented a specialist rebate as part of its new pricing structure. Routing and Clearing NYSE Group incurs routing charges when the NYSE or NYSE Arca do not have the best buy or sell order in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on the NYSE or NYSE Arca. In that case, NYSE Group routes the customers order to the external market center that displays the best buy order or sell order. The external market center charges the NYSE or NYSE Arca a fee per share for routing to its system. Also, NYSE Arca incurs clearance, brokerage and related transaction expenses, which primarily include costs incurred in self clearing activities, service fees paid per trade to exchanges for trade execution, and costs incurred due to erroneous trade execution. Systems and Communications NYSE Groups systems and communications expense includes: (i) certain costs for development and maintenance of trading, regulatory and administrative systems; (ii) investments in system capacity, reliability and security and (iii) network connection with its customers and its data centers, as well as connectivity to various other market centers. Professional Services NYSE Groups professional services expense includes consulting charges related to various technological and operational initiatives, as well as legal and audit fees. Our historical spending related to professional services consists principally of legal and consulting expenses. While we are focused on reducing costs, including 93 Table of Contents professional services costs, we cannot assure you that our professional services expenses will decline in the future. Under certain circumstances, particularly as we pursue our business strategy, we may be required to incur significant professional services costs, such as legal expenses. Depreciation and Amortization This item includes costs from depreciating fixed assets and amortizing intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. It also includes depreciation of computer hardware and capitalized software. Occupancy Occupancy includes costs related to NYSE Groups leased premises, as well as real estate taxes and maintenance of owned premises. Marketing and Other Marketing and other expenses includes advertising, printing and promotion expenses, insurance premiums, travel and entertainment expenses as well as other administrative expenses. Regulatory Fine Income Regulatory fine income is generated from fines levied by NYSE Regulation, which regulates and monitors the activities on our securities exchanges and enforces issuer and member organization compliance with applicable law and the rules of the exchanges. The frequency in which fines may be levied and their amount will vary based upon the actions of participants on the NYSE and NYSE Arca. Regulatory fines are used for regulatory purposes. Pending the closing of the consolidation of certain NYSE Regulation functions with the NASD, we expect that NYSE Regulation will continue to levy fines for regulatory purposes as appropriate. We anticipate that regulatory fine income will decrease following the closing of the consolidation. 94 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2006 versus Year Ended December 31, 2005 Overview The following table sets forth NYSE Groups consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each consolidated statement of income item for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2005.

For the same period a year ago, the results of operations of NYSE Group only included the results of NYSE and SIAC. For the year ended December 31, 2006, NYSE Group reported revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), operating income and net income of $1,702.8 million, $233.5 million and $205.0 million, respectively. This compares to revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), operating income and net income of $1,038.6 million, $43.6 million and $40.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005. 95 Table of Contents The $664.2 million increase in revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), $189.9 million increase in operating income and $164.2 million increase in net income for the period reflect the following principal factors. Increased revenues NYSE Arca results of operations were consolidated from the March 7, 2006 merger with Archipelago and contributed revenues of $594.1 million (excluding activity assessment fees), which was the primary driver of the period over period increase. Increased operating income The period over period increase in operating income of $189.9 million was the result of NYSE Arcas contribution to operating income of $134.2 million as well as other revenue growth and overall operating efficiencies as we continue to meet our integration goals. Improved net income Period over period, net income increased $164.2 million including $86.9 million related to NYSE Arca, due to revenue growth and overall operating efficiencies. Segment Results Subsequent to the merger between the NYSE and Archipelago and the minority interest purchase of SIAC, NYSE Group operates under two reportable segments: Market and Regulation. NYSE Groups segments are managed and operated as two business units and organized based on services provided to customers. Market represents primarily the fees earned from: (i) obtaining new listings and servicing existing listings on the NYSE and NYSE Arca, Inc.; (ii) providing access to trade execution; (iii) distributing market information to data subscribers; (iv) issuing trading licenses (previously membership fees) and (v) via SIAC providing communication and data processing operations. Regulation provides regulatory services (including member firm regulation, market surveillance, enforcement, listed company compliance, and arbitration), performed by NYSE Regulation, to the NYSE and to NYSE Arca. Regulatory fees are paid by member organizations and are primarily assessed based upon their Gross FOCUS revenues. In addition, NYSE Regulation collects regulatory fines that are imposed upon members and member organizations and their employees. Market Segment Results Revenues Year ended December 31, PercentIncrease(Decrease) Dollars (in Millions) 2006 2005 Activity assessment $ 673.2 $ 594.6 13.2 % Transaction 675.9 145.8 363.6 % Listing 356.1 342.7 3.9 % Market data 222.5 178.2 24.9 % Data processing 137.1 182.9 (25.0 )% Market services provided to Regulation 125.5 123.4 1.7 % Licensing, facility and other 127.0 56.4 125.2 % Total revenues $ 2,317.3 $ 1,624.0 42.7 % Transaction For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, transaction fees increased by $530.1 million, or 13.2%, primarily as a result of NYSE Arcas contribution since the completion of the merger with Archipelago on March 7, 2006. Listing The following table sets forth the revenues from listing fees calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (as reported) and as would be reported on a basis without giving effect to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (billed basis). NYSE Group believes that the 96 Table of Contents presentation of billed basis revenues, as they relate to original fees, is a good indicator of current listing fee activity as billed basis information excludes the effects of recognizing revenues related to original fees over periods ranging from 5 to 10 years. Year ended December 31, Percent Increase(Decrease) 2006 2005 Dollars (in Millions) Asreported Asbilled Asreported Asbilled Asreported Asbilled Annual fees $ 265.8 $ 265.8 $ 252.2 $ 252.2 5.4 % 5.4 % Original fees 90.3 80.2 90.5 83.9 (0.2 )% (4.4 )% $ 356.1 $ 346.0 $ 342.7 $ 336.1 3.9 % 2.9 % For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, listing fee revenue increased $13.4 million, or 3.9%, on an as reported basis. Listing fees are primarily derived from annual listing fees and original listing fees. Original listing fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated service periods ranging from 5 to 10 years. The difference between the as reported revenues and the billed basis revenues is due to the amortization of listing fees in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Annual listing fees totaled $265.8 million on both an as reported and billed basis for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $252.2 million on both an as reported and billed basis for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 5.4%. The period over period improvement is due to the increase in aggregate shares billed at the beginning of the year, from approximately 387 billion to 408 billion, as well as new listings of shares during the year, which generate annual fees for the period of the year listed. Annual listing fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original listing fees amounted to $90.3 million on an as reported basis. On a billed basis, original listing fees totaled $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of $3.7 million, or 4.4%, compared to the as billed original listing fees for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to a change in pricing and a reduction of corporate actions period over period. Market Data For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, market data fees increased $44.3 million, or 24.9%, primarily from the contribution of NYSE Arcas operations, following the completion of the merger between the NYSE and Archipelago on March 7, 2006. Data processing For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, data processing fees decreased $45.8 million, or 25.0%, to $137.1million. The decline is due to reduced level of services provided by SIAC to customers other than the NYSE. Market services provided to Regulation For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, market services provided to Regulation increased $2.1 million, or 1.7%. These services, which include costs associated with supporting IT infrastructure, finance, human resources and other administrative functions, are provided by Market to support the operations of Regulation. Licensing, facility and other For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, licensing and facility fees increased $70.6 million, or 125.2%. Licensing fees represented $51.4 million of the increase. NYSE Group did not generate licensing fees in the same period a year ago. Also driving the increase was increased specialist trading privilege fees of $11.0 million as compared to the same period a year ago. As part of the NYSEs new pricing structure, the specialist trading privilege fee was discontinued in December 2006. 97 Table of Contents Regulation Segment Results Revenues Year ended December 31, PercentIncrease(Decrease) Dollars (in Millions) 2006 2005 Regulatory $ 184.2 $ 132.6 38.9 % Regulatory services provided to Market 127.9 119.9 6.7 % Total revenues $ 312.1 $ 252.5 23.6 % Regulatory Fees For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, regulatory fees increased $51.6 million, or 38.9%, to $184.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, NYSE Arca contributed regulatory fees of $9.2 million. The remaining $42.4 million increase was primarily due to higher reported Gross FOCUS revenues ($284.0 billion compared to $186.5 billion period over period). Regulatory services provided to Market For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, regulatory services provided to Market increased $8.0 million or 6.7%. These services, which include costs associated with surveillance, examination and enforcement with respect to Market activities, and overseeing compliance by listed companies, are provided by Regulation. The increase primarily reflects increased compensation costs for cash awards granted to Regulation employees following the merger between the NYSE and Archipelago.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, the operations of NYSE Arca accounted for $11.8 million of the $99.8 million of professional services. The decrease was primarily due to reduced legal fees and the achievement of certain integration synergies. Depreciation and Amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, depreciation and amortization increased $32.4 million, or 32.8%. The operations of NYSE Arca represented $29.6 million of the increase following the March 7, 2006 merger with Archipelago.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, compensation increased $11.4 million, or 10.0%, to $125.4 million. This increase was primarily due to the $10.2 million of cash awards granted to NYSE employees at the time of the merger with Archipelago. Excluding the cash awards compensation increased $1.2 million due to increased salaries offset by decreased benefits associated with changes to the benefit plans. Market services provided to Regulation. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, market support costs increased $2.1 million, or 1.7%. Professional services. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, professional services increased $8.1 million to $10.6 million. These costs increased as newly established mandatory regulatory audits commenced during 2006.

Regulatory Fine Income For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, fine income increased $1.0 million to $36.4 million. Regulatory fines result from actions taken by Regulation in its oversight of Market constituents and accordingly may vary period over period. 100 Table of Contents Investment and Other Income, Net The components of investment and other income, net, were as follows: Year ended December 31, Dollars (in Millions) 2006 2005 Investment income, net $ 40.7 $ 34.8 DTCC settlement gain 10.8 Other 22.5 12.5 Total $ 74.0 $ 47.3 The increase in investment income, net, is primarily attributable to an increase in the average interest bearing investment portfolio and higher interest rates. DTCC settlement gain reflects a one time payment from certain subsidiaries of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) in connection with the termination of their service agreement with SIAC. NYSE Groups share (net of minority interest of $3.6 million) of the one time settlement gain was $7.2 million. Insurance claims are contingent on various factors and accordingly may vary period to period. Gain on Sale of Equity Investment During 2006, NYSE Group sold DTCC shares of common stock it held for a $23.4 million cash payment. NYSE Group carried this investment at its $2.5 million cost and therefore realized a $20.9 million pre tax gain. The after tax impact of this gain was included in the cash dividend paid to each former NYSE members in connection with the March 7, 2006 merger of NYSE and Archipelago. Income Taxes The consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was 36.7% and 53.0%, respectively. The 2005 effective tax rate was significantly higher than the standard rate due to non deductible merger related expenses for litigation. The 2006 effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily as a result of federal and state tax credits. 101 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2005 versus December 31, 2004 The following table sets forth NYSE Groups consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each consolidated statement of income item for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2004.

This compares to revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), operating income and net income of $1,045.7 million, $12.9 million and $30.2 million, respectively. The $7.1 million decrease in revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), $30.7 million increase in operating income and $10.6 million increase in net income for the period reflect the following principal factors: Decreased revenues. The period over period decrease in revenues of $7.1 million was primarily driven by reduced data processing fees partially offset by growth in many key businesses. Increased operating income. The period over period increase in operating income of $30.7 million was the result of ongoing cost reduction initiatives offset by merger expense and exit costs from the merger with Archipelago. Improved net income. Period over period, net income increased $10.6 million, primarily reflecting cost reduction initiatives. 102 Table of Contents Market Segment Results Revenues Year ended December 31, PercentIncrease(Decrease) Dollars (in Millions) 2005 2004 Activity assessment $ 594.6 $ 359.8 65.3 % Transaction 145.8 153.6 (5.1 )% Listing 342.7 329.8 3.9 % Market data 178.2 167.6 6.3 % Data processing 182.9 220.2 (16.9 )% Market services provided to Regulation 123.4 121.5 1.6 % Licensing, facility and other 56.4 59.3 (4.9 )% Total revenues $ 1,624.0 $ 1,411.8 15.0 % Transaction For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, transaction fees decreased by $7.8 million, or 5.1%. Although NYSE Group listed average daily volume was up 9.0%, pricing structures in place during 2005 relating to dollar caps inhibited the NYSE Groups ability to generate revenue growth. Partially offsetting this decline in revenue was an increase in revenue derived from ETF transactions. These revenues increased 136.3% as compared to 2004 as the trading activity increased from 236 million shares during 2004 to 926 million shares for 2005. Listing The following table sets forth the revenues from listing fees calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (as reported) and as would be reported on a basis without giving effect to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (billed basis). NYSE Group believes that the presentation of billed basis revenues, as they relate to original fees, is a good indicator of current listing fee activity as billed basis information excludes the effects of recognizing revenues related to original fees over 10 years. Year ended December 31, Percent Increase(Decrease) (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 Asreported Asbilled Asreported Asbilled Asreported Asbilled Annual fees $ 252.2 $ 252.2 $ 241.3 $ 241.3 4.5 % 4.5 % Original fees 90.5 83.9 88.5 79.6 2.3 % 5.4 % $ 342.7 $ 336.1 $ 329.8 $ 320.9 3.9 % 4.8 % For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, listing fee revenue increased $12.9 million, or 3.9%, on an as reported basis. Listing fees are primarily derived from annual listing fees and original listing fees. For the periods presented, original listing fees were deferred and recognized over an estimated service period of 10 years. The difference between the as reported revenues and the billed basis revenues is due to the amortization of listing fees in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Annual listing fees totaled $252.2 million on both an as reported and billed basis for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $241.3 million on both an as reported and billed basis for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 4.5%. The period over period improvement is due to the increase in aggregate shares billed at the beginning of the year, from approximately 355 billion to 387 billion, as well as new listings of shares during the year, which generate annual fees for the period of the year listed. Annual listing fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. 103 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2005, original listing fees amounted to $90.5 million on an as reported basis. On a billed basis, original listing fees totaled $83.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $79.6 million in 2004, a 5.4% increase. Original listings of operating companies, closed end funds and ETFs increased year over year from 165 to 192, which drove the increase in original fees billed. Market data For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, market data fees increased $10.6 million, or 6.3%. The number of non professional users increased by 13.4% year over year. The demand for NYSE OpenBook&reg;, NYSE Groups proprietary data product, continued to increase, as the number of subscribers was 17.5% higher than the same period a year ago causing increased open book revenue of 24.7% to $21.2 million. NYSE Groups non recurring revenue of $5.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 comprises (i) charges for customers who had previously not reported the appropriate number of professional devices in use and (ii) an allowance for doubtful accounts reduction. In the normal course of business, NYSE Group audits its customers and the number of devices they report (on which it generates its billing) and adjusts its records based on the audit results, if necessary. This can lead to both increases and decreases in current billings. Additionally, NYSE Groups allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced after a review of its policy for reserving market data revenues, and based on current levels of recoveries and collections, which have improved over the past year. Somewhat offsetting the increase in market information fees was the NYSEs share of trades decreasing period over period, from 90.6% to 87.5%. Data processing For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, data processing fees decreased $37.3 million, or 16.9%, due to decreases in services provided by SIAC to customers other than the NYSE and lower revenues from the communications services of Sector, Inc. Market services provided to Regulation For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, market services provided to Regulation increased $1.9 million, or 1.6%. These services, which include costs associated with supporting IT infrastructure, finance, human resources and other administrative functions, are provided by Market to support the operations of Regulation. Licensing, facility and other For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, licensing and facility fees decreased $2.9 million, or 4.9%. The decrease was due to fewer electronic access member renewals period over period and lower electronic access member prices.

Member regulation fees drove the increase for the year due to higher reported gross FOCUS revenues ($186.5 billion in 2005 as compared to $145.6 billion in 2004). Regulatory services provided to Market For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, regulatory services provided to Market remained relatively unchanged.

Insurance claims are contingent on various factors and accordingly may vary period to period. Income Taxes The consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was 53.0% and 28.0%, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, NYSE Groups primary source of liquidity has been cash generated by NYSE Groups operations, and NYSE Groups liquidity requirements have been for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate use. NYSE Groups working capital was $610.9 million at December 31, 2006, and capital expenditures equaled $97.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Capital expenditures related primarily to the development and maintenance of corporate and regulatory systems and to trading technology, including expenditures relating to the development and implementation of NYSE Hybrid Market and compliance with Regulation NMS. Cash and cash equivalents are generated primarily from listing services, sales of market information, collection of activity assessment fees (which are fully remitted to the SEC), data processing services provided by SIAC, collections of regulatory fees, fees generated for trading, and investment income. At December 31, 2006, NYSE Group had $277.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $234.2 million from its cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2005. Current assets readily convertible into cash include accounts receivable, securities purchased under agreements to resell and marketable securities. These assets totaled $1,036.2 million at December 31, 2006 and, when combined with cash and cash equivalents, represented 91.0% of NYSE Groups current assets. 107 Table of Contents Under the terms of the operating agreement of the NYSE, no regulatory fees, fines or penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be distributed to NYSE Group or any entity other than NYSE Regulation. As a result, the use of regulatory fees, fines and penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be considered restricted. As of December 31, 2006, NYSE Group did not have any significant restricted cash balance. With respect to investment activities, the boards of directors of NYSE Group has an approved investment policy for externally managed portfolios. The goal of this policy is to preserve principal, maintain adequate liquidity at all times, fund budgeted operating and capital requirements, and to maximize returns relative to investing guidelines and market conditions. NYSE Groups current policy prevents it from investing directly in any equity type investment; however, this policy can be modified at the discretion of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of NYSE Group, based on the delegation of authority by the board of directors. Under NYSE Groups policy, it may invest only in securities that are rated AA or better by two nationally recognized rating organizations and that are in U.S. dollar denominations. The average duration of the portfolio must not exceed two years. NYSE Group periodically reviews our respective policies and investment managers. Also included in the investment portfolio are investments which are used to fund non qualified benefit obligations. The participants of these plans, supplemental executive savings and other deferred compensation plans, are permitted to invest in equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, NYSE Group had no outstanding short term or long term debt. In connection with the exchange offer, NYSE Euronext, as the borrower, and NYSE Group, as the guarantor (until completion of the combination), entered into a 2.5 billion revolving credit bridge facility, on January 5, 2007. NYSE Euronext may only borrow amounts under this bridge facility agreement to fund the cash portion of the consideration being offered to Euronext shareholders in the exchange offer. NYSE Euronext, with NYSE Group as guarantor (until completion of the combination), also intends to enter into a $3.0 billion syndicated revolving credit facility, which is expected to be used primarily as a backstop for a global commercial paper program. The proceeds from the global commercial paper program will be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of amounts borrowed under the bridge facility and or the syndicated revolving credit facility. The bridge facility includes and the syndicated revolving credit facility is expected to include terms and conditions customary for agreements of this type, which may restrict NYSE Euronexts ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness. NYSE Group believes that cash flows from operating activities and financing capabilities along with future cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet the needs of its current operations. If existing cash balances are insufficient, NYSE Group intends to seek additional financing. NYSE Group may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. Net cash provided by operating activities equaled $218.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, consisting of net income of $205.0 million and the effects of non cash items, such as depreciation, which does not adversely affect cash flows. Net cash provided by investing activities equaled $505.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. NYSE Group acquired $218.2 million of cash in connection with the Archipelago merger. Net sales of investment securities and securities purchased under agreements to resell of $410.9 million funded the $409.8 million distribution to NYSE former members. As part of the merger with Archipelago, NYSE Groups financing activities included a total cash distribution of $506.2 million (consisting of a $409.8 million cash distribution and a $96.4 million dividend) to the NYSEs former members during the year ended December 31, 2006. 108 Table of Contents Summary Disclosures About Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes NYSE Groups future minimum lease obligations on its operating and capital leases as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Payments due by year Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Operating lease obligations $ 298,060 $ 63,903 $ 50,932 $ 41,928 $ 36,967 $ 23,622 $ 80,708 Capital lease obligations(1) 17,906 8,722 7,676 1,337 94 77 Total $ 315,966 $ 72,625 $ 58,608 $ 43,265 $ 37,061 $ 23,699 $ 80,708 (1) The capital lease payments also include interest payable of approximately $2.5 million. NYSE Group also has obligations related to the deferred compensation and other post retirement benefits. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined. See notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following provides information about NYSE Groups critical accounting estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Revenue Recognition Companies pay listing fees when they initially list on the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc. and annually thereafter. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and other corporate action related fees. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company initially lists with the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be listed on the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc., such as stock splits, right issues, sales of additional securities, and mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee. Annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of the listed company at the end of the previous year. These fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original listing fees are recognized on a straight line basis over their estimated service periods of 10 years for the NYSE and 5 years for NYSE Arca, Inc. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management believes to be sufficient to absorb probable losses in NYSE Groups accounts receivable portfolio and is assessed periodically by management. Increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged against operating results and it is decreased by the amount of charge offs, net of recoveries. The allowance is based on several factors, including a continuous assessment of the collectibility of each account. In circumstances where a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations is known, NYSE Group records a specific provision for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected. Accounts with outstanding balances in excess of 60 to 90 days are reviewed monthly to make changes to the allowance as appropriate. Income Taxes NYSE Group records income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. 109 Table of Contents Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and tax bases in assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided for certain tax carryforwards. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. NYSE Group is subject to numerous domestic jurisdictions primarily based on our operations in these jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in NYSE Groups financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could have material impact on NYSE Groups financial position or results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Employee Benefits (OPEB) In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans (collectively benefit plans) to recognize the funded status of their benefit plans in the statement of financial position, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end statement of financial condition, and provide additional disclosures. On December 31, 2006, NYSE Group adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158. The effect of adopting SFAS 158 on NYSE Groups financial condition at December 31, 2006 has been included in the consolidated financial statements. Pension and OPEB costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect NYSE Groups pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets NYSE Group reviews the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based upon estimated fair value of NYSE Groups reporting units. Should the review indicate that goodwill is impaired, NYSE Groups goodwill would be reduced by the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its fair value. NYSE Group reviews the useful life of its indefinite lived intangible assets to determine whether events of circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life. In addition, the carrying value of NYSE Groups other intangible assets is reviewed by NYSE Group on at least an annual basis for impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the asset. NYSE Group performed its annual impairment tests as of December 31, 2006, which indicated that no impairment charge was required for goodwill, indefinite lived intangible assets or intangible assets. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of assets is provided for using the straight line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 2 to 15 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Gains or losses related to retirements or disposition of fixed assets are recognized in the period incurred. NYSE Group accounts for software development costs under AICPA Statement of Position 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use (SOP 98 1), and other related guidance. NYSE Group expenses software development costs incurred during the preliminary 110 Table of Contents project stage, while it capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage, which includes design, coding, installation and testing activities. Amortization of capitalized software development costs is computed on a straight line basis over the softwares estimated useful life, generally three years. Stock Based Compensation NYSE Group adopted SFAS 123R, Share Based Payment, during the first quarter of 2006. SFAS 123R required that compensation expense associated with share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. SFAS 123R also required that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow. Compensation expense is based on the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the grant date and recognized ratably over the vesting period. NYSE Group estimates an expected forfeiture rate while recognizing the expense associated with these awards. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Uncertain Tax Positions In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of Statement of Financial Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 addresses how a reporting company accounts for all tax positions including the uncertain tax positions reflected or expected to be reflected in the companys past or future tax returns. The interpretation also requires the company to recognize interest and penalties associated with the uncertain tax positions. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that the implementation of FIN 48 will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. SAB 108 In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current year Financial Statements (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006 and it allows a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings for errors that were not previously deemed material, but are material under the guidance in SAB 108. Prior to 2006, NYSE relied on license holders (former members) to self report transaction volume and remit payment for the related transaction fees on a one month lag. Starting in December 2006, NYSE Group commenced billing license holders for trading activity brought to the floor of the NYSE. As a result, NYSE Group eliminated the one month lag in recognizing NYSE related transaction revenues. However, instead of recording both the self reported November transaction fees and the accrued December transaction fees in the December 2006 results of operations (which would have resulted in reporting 13 months of transaction fee revenue in fiscal 2006), NYSE Group elected to increase its January 1, 2006, retained earnings by approximately $6.6 million, which corresponds to the impact of the thirteenth month of transaction fee revenues, net of related income taxes. Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS 157 provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable. SFAS 157 also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value, and the effect of the fair value measures on earnings. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the implementation of SFAS 157 will have on our financial statements. 111 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF EURONEXT The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Euronexts audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 included herein. Euronexts consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. IFRS differ in certain material respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. For a discussion of certain material differences between IFRS and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, see Summary of Material Differences Between IFRS and U.S. GAAP below and the related notes in Euronexts consolidated financial statements. Overview Since it was founded in 2000, Euronext has been committed to promoting the integration and consolidation of Europes capital markets and increasing the efficiency of cross border trading. In pursuit of that objective, Euronext has pursued opportunities to consolidate and integrate its markets, most notably through the adoption of a harmonized rulebook and the integration of the Groups trading platforms through a four year migration plan that was completed in 2004. These efforts, combined with Euronexts efforts to streamline its organizational structure to create a cross border, business oriented organization based on strategic business units, have allowed Euronext to reduce operating costs and to eliminate redundancies. As a result of a good performance by both trading and Information services activities, as well as Euronexts continued efforts to keep operating costs under strict control, net income increased from 149.7 in 2004 to 240.0 million in 2005 and to 361.8 million in 2006. The changes in net income during the period under review primarily reflected changes in profit from operations, which increase from 200.1 million in 2004 to 318.5 million in 2005 and to 409.0 million in 2006. Over the period, Euronexts profit from operations increased as a percentage of revenues from 22.6% in 2004 to 33.1% in 2005 and to 37.1 % in 2006. Sources of Revenue and Principal Expense Items Operating revenues Cash trading Euronext generates cash trading revenue from fees charged primarily for the execution of trades of equity and debt securities and other cash instruments on Euronexts cash market, which is comprised of the separate cash markets operated in Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and Lisbon. For historical reasons relating to Euronexts prior ownership of Clearnet, part of the trading fee consists of a commission paid by LCH.Clearnet to Euronext as a retrocession. These payments were recorded by Euronext as part of its cash trading revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004. In 2003, these payments were recorded as clearing revenues since Clearnet was consolidated in Euronexts accounts until the end of 2003. Euronext has implemented a harmonized fee structure for its cash trading activity, which was most recently updated in February 2005. Under the current fee structure: For trading in equities, there are three different fee packages. The first package involves a flat fee per trade and no minimum activity charge. The other two packages involve a monthly minimum activity charge and a fee per trade calculated on a sliding scale based on volume and the level of the minimum activity charge. An ad valorem fee based on transaction size is also applied to each trade. No order fee is charged so long as the order/trade ratio does not exceed a specified level. For trackers and investment funds, a flat fee is charged for each order placed, and an ad valorem fee based on transaction size is applied to each trade. 112 Table of Contents For warrants and certificates, a flat fee is charged for each order placed, and a flat fee per trade is charged. For bonds, no order fee is charged as long as the order/trade ratio does not exceed a specified level, and a fee per trade is charged according to a sliding scale based on volume. The retrocession for cash trading activity from LCH.Clearnet is based, in the case of Euronext Paris, on a fixed amount per trade from each side of the transaction plus a variable amount that is based on a percentage of the value of the trades cleared. The retrocession for each of Euronext Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon is based on a flat percentage (which varies by exchange) of clearing fees collected by LCH.Clearnet in respect of trades on such exchanges cash market. The fee amounts are determined under the clearing agreement between LCH.Clearnet and Euronexts continental European exchanges, and increased on an annual basis during the 2004 to 2006 period. Revenue from cash trading in any given period depends primarily on the number of trades executed on Euronext and the average price per trade charged for their execution. The level of trading activity is heavily influenced by general market conditions. Other factors may include the number and financial health of companies listed on Euronexts cash markets, and general competitive conditions. Listing fees Listing fees comprise admission fees paid by issuers to list securities on the cash market, annual fees paid by companies whose financial instruments are listed on the cash market, and corporate activity and other fees, consisting primarily of fees charged by Euronext Paris for centralizing shares in initial public offerings and tender offers. Revenues from listing fees primarily relate to shares. Euronext has adopted a common set of listing fees for Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels and Euronext Lisbon. Under the harmonized fee book, domestic issuers ( i.e. , those from France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal) pay admission fees based on market capitalization to list their securities. Subsequent listings of securities receive a 50% discount on admission fees. Non domestic companies are charged admission and annual fees on a similar basis but are subject to lower maximum admission fees and annual fees. Euronext Paris also charges centralization fees for collecting and allocating retail investor orders in initial public offerings and tender offers. Listing fees are recognized upfront except for annual fees, which are recognized ratably throughout the year. The revenue Euronext derives from listing fees is primarily dependent on the number and size of new company listings and tender offers. The number and size of new company listings and tender offers in any period depends primarily on factors outside of Euronexts control, including general economic conditions in Europe and in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal (in particular, stock market conditions) and the success of competing stock exchanges in attracting and retaining listed companies. Derivatives trading Revenue from derivatives trading consists of fixed per contract fees for the execution of trades of derivatives contracts on Euronexts derivatives markets in Paris, London, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. Revenues are driven by the number of trades and fees charged per contract. The principal types of contracts traded are equity and index products and short term interest rate products, which contributed 34% and 62%, respectively, of trading revenues in 2006. Trading in equity products is primarily driven by price volatility on equity markets and indices and trading in short term interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility 113 Table of Contents resulting from uncertainty over the direction of short term interest rates. The level of trading activity is largely outside of Euronexts control. Euronext has recorded retrocession fees from LCH.Clearnet in respect of trades executed on Euronexts continental derivatives markets under derivatives trading revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Retrocession fees for derivatives trading were eliminated at the end of 2006. As of January 1, 2007, Euronext will no longer receive retrocession fees from LCH.Clearnet in respect of trades executed on Euronexts continental derivatives markets. Euronext.liffes fee grid varies by type of contract and by type of member. With respect to the various contracts available through Euronext.liffe, fees are charged as follows: Individual equity options: a flat fee per lot is charged in all Euronext.liffe business centers, except in Amsterdam (where the fees are capped). Individual equity futures: this type of contract is available in Lisbon and London, in respect of which a flat fee is charged per lot. Index products: fees for these products are based on a flat fee per contract, and are capped in Amsterdam above a certain level. BClear: this is one of three services for wholesale equity derivatives that Euronext launched in 2005. Nearly all equity derivative contracts listed in our 5 centers and more than 300 underlyings listed in other non Euronext markets are listed on BClear. The BClear fee structure is based on a per lot fee per side up to a fee cap. Interest rate products: these products are available in London, in respect of which a fee is charged per lot. Commodity products: these products are available in London and Paris, in respect of which a flat fee is charged per lot. Each Euronext.liffe center, except for Lisbon, provides preferred rates to market makers as follows: In London, with respect to single equity options, market makers may be categorized as primary market makers (PMM) or designated market makers (DMM), which are exempt from transaction charges or receive fee discounts on business they transact in a market making capacity. A separate DMM category exists for the FTSE 100 Index options contract (ESX) as well as a specific regime that governs trades in the FTSEurofirst contract. In Amsterdam, market makers pay a liquidity provider fee (0.07 per lot) based on the category, or Euronext Class Combination (ECC), in which a market maker falls. In Paris, market makers pay either 0.03 or 0.04 per lot for orders of up to 6,000 lots, depending on whether they act as a permanent market maker (PMM) or responding market maker (RMM). For orders above 6,000 lots, PMMs or RMMs pay 80 per trade. In Brussels, market makers are eligible for a low fee, equivalent to the liquidity provider fee in Amsterdam on equity options. MTS fixed income In November 2005, Euronext acquired 51.0% of a joint venture entity, MBE Holding, which currently owns 60.37% of the voting shares of MTS. Euronext proportionally consolidated MTS for only one month in 2005, recording proportionally consolidated revenues from MTS of 1.4 million. 114 Table of Contents Revenues from MTS are derived from membership fees, transactions fee and post trading fees for the execution of trades of cash and money market products. MTS implemented a new fee structure in January 2005 with the following principal characteristics: For the trading of cash products on its main markets (MTS Italy, EuroMTS and MTS Deutschland), MTS charges a per trade fee calculated on a sliding scale based on annual volume. Under the new fee structure, membership fees for market makers are waived. For the trading of money market products, MTS charges a per trade fee calculated on a sliding scale based on annual volume. For trading on BondVision, MTS charges a fee per trade calculated on a sliding scale based on annual volume. Post trading fees are calculated on the number of settlement messages. Revenue from MTS in any given period depends primarily on the number of trades executed on its platform and the average price per trade charged for their execution. The level of trading activity is heavily influenced by general market conditions (volatility levels in the bond markets and interest rate levels) and thus outside of Euronexts control. Settlement and custody Revenue from settlement and custody currently consists of fees for settling securities trades and fees for associated custodial services relating to securities traded in Euronexts cash markets in Portugal, which are generated by Interbolsa. During each of the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, these fees also included settlement and custody fees generated by Euronexts cash markets in Brussels, which were generated by CIK (Belgium) which was sold to Euroclear in 2006. Settlement and custody fees vary by market, and are charged on a per trade basis for settlement fees and on a fee based on the market value of the securities in question for custody services. Information services Revenue from information services consists of fees that Euronext charges to a variety of users, primarily the end users, for the use of Euronexts real time market data services. Euronext also collects annual license fees from vendors for the right to distribute Euronext data to third parties and a service fee from vendors for direct connection. A substantial majority of Euronexts data revenues is derived from monthly end user fees. Euronext also derives revenues from selling historical and reference data about securities, and by publishing the daily official lists for the Euronext markets. The principal drivers of information services revenues are the number of end users and the prices for data packages. Sale of software Revenue from sale of software primarily consists of license fees received from securities exchanges and other financial institutions for software that Euronext develops internally or licenses. Throughout the periods under review, this revenue was generated primarily by GL TRADE. In addition, until June 30, 2005, sale of software included fees received by LIFFE Market Solutions for its LIFFE CONNECT&reg; software package. On July 1, 2005, these latter activities were transferred to AEMS. GL TRADEs revenues are earned mainly from annual subscriptions to its software and technology offerings (subscriptions represented approximately 76% of GL TRADEs revenues in 2006). Subscriptions generally have an initial term of two years, and are renewed annually absent notice of cancellation. Most subscription contracts are on a calendar year basis. Subscriptions are generally paid in advance. The group records revenues from subscription agreements on a pro rata basis over the life of the subscription agreements, 115 Table of Contents with the unrealized portions of invoiced subscription fees recorded as deferred revenues. Because of the annual nature of subscription agreements, changes in subscription revenues typically lag developments in the markets that GL TRADE serves. Subscription fees include basic service packages. Customers are invoiced separately for GL TRADEs enhanced service packages. A portion of GL TRADEs revenues, principally for its advanced order management offering, are derived from sales of five year software licenses, which are generally accompanied by annual maintenance and service contracts. The bulk of GL TRADEs revenues from these arrangements are recorded at the time of the license sale, while the maintenance contracts are typically renewed over time and thus generate recurrent revenues. As a result, a major license contract can have a significant impact on GL TRADEs revenues for a given period, which will not necessarily carry forward to the same extent into future periods. Other income The primary recurring items within other income are rental income, administrative services provided to LCH.Clearnet on a transitional basis following its creation and since July 1, 2005, charges to AEMS for the supply of transitional services provided by Euronext. Costs and expenses The following is a summary of Euronexts principal cost and expense categories. Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of employee salaries and bonuses, compulsory social security contributions with respect to employees and pension expenses. Since January 1, 2004, this line item has included stock option expense recorded under IFRS 2. Depreciation Depreciation consists of depreciation of tangible fixed assets and intangible fixed assets (excluding goodwill) as well as write offs on intangible assets. Goodwill amortization Euronext adopted IFRS 3 for all business combinations agreed on or after March 31, 2004. Starting January 1, 2005, Euronext no longer amortizes goodwill relating to acquisitions made before March 31, 2004 as part of a business combination, in line with IFRS 3. From January 1, 2005, goodwill is assessed periodically for impairment. During 2003 and 2004, goodwill amortization primarily consisted of amortization of goodwill related to Euronexts acquisition of LIFFE. The balance of goodwill primarily related to the merger that led to Euronexts creation in September 2000, as well as goodwill relating to Euronexts acquisition of BVLP ( Bolsa de Valores de Lisboa e Porto , now known as Euronext Lisbon). Information technology expenses IT expenses consist primarily of costs relating to fees paid to third party providers of networks and information technology resources, including fees for consulting, research and development services, software rental costs and licenses, hardware rental and related fees paid to third party maintenance providers. Since July 1, 2005, these expenses consist primarily of fees charged by AEMS for IT services relating to the operation and maintenance of Euronexts cash and derivatives trading platforms, including license fees relating to NSC and LIFFE CONNECT&reg;. 116 Table of Contents Office, telecom and consultancy Office, telecom and consultancy costs consist primarily of travel expenses, telecommunications expenses, fees for insurance and information services, third party contracting fees and fees paid to consultants, (other than information technology consultants) attorneys and accountants. Accommodation Accommodation costs and expenses include lease payments for rented office space and related service charges for utilities, security, maintenance and cleaning and related items. Euronext is reimbursed for certain expenses by third parties, including AEMS, under sublease arrangements. Marketing costs Marketing costs consist primarily of advertising and other promotional expenses including costs relating to presentations, events, sponsorships, foreign offices and similar items. Other expenses Other expenses consist of miscellaneous costs, including irrecoverable VAT and other sundry non income taxes, regulatory fees, production costs for information services and other miscellaneous costs. Net financing income Net financing income consists of interest income (primarily interest earned on short term investments, deposits and cash balances with banks), interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses on disposal of investments and gains and losses on revaluation of financial assets and liabilities the changes in fair value of which are booked in the income statement (primarily derivative instruments). Income from associates Income from associates consists of Euronexts share in the results of operations of associated companies (i.e., companies over which Euronext has a significant influence, but over which it does not exercise control). Euronext accounts for these entities under the equity method after taking into consideration the effect of intercompany transactions. Income from associates during the period under review primarily consisted of Euronexts share of the results of LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. and AEMS. Minority interests Minority interests during the period under review related primarily to the approximately 60% interest held by third parties in GL TRADE and, since December 2005, the interest held by minority investors in MTS. 117 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Revenues Euronexts total revenues increased by 14.6% from 961.9 million in 2005 to 1,102.2 million in 2006, driven by a very high level of trading activity on Euronexts cash and derivatives markets. The following table summarizes the composition of Euronexts revenues in 2005 and 2006. Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 %Change 2006/2005 (in thousands of euros) Cash trading Trade execution fees, order fees and connection fees 230,356 174,624 31.9 % Clearing fee retrocession for cash trading 56,543 41,119 37.5 % Subtotal 286,899 215,743 33.0 % Listing fees 55,637 63,130 (11.9 )% Derivatives trading Order fees 390,665 326,125 19.8 % Clearing fee retrocession for continental derivatives trading 906 5,798 (84.4 )% Subtotal 391,571 331,923 18.0 % MTS fixed income 24,019 1,437 NA Settlement and custody 14,553 39,280 (62.9 )% Information services 112,004 93,592 19.7 % Sale of software 184,607 195,212 (5.4 )% Other income 32,901 21,550 52.7 % Total revenues 1,102,191 961,867 14.6 % Cash trading Revenue from cash trading increased by 33.0% to 286.9 million in 2006, due primarily to the continuation and acceleration of the strong recovery in market activity which started in the second half of 2005. 219.5 million cash transactions were executed on Euronexts cash markets in 2006, a 35.1% increase over 2005 corresponding to a daily average of 860,692 trades (itself a 36.2% increase over 2005). As a consequence, trade execution and connection fees increased by 31.9% in 2006 to 230.4 million from 174.6 million in 2005, with the average fee per trade decreasing slightly (from 1.03 to 1.02) due to Euronexts sliding fee scale. The clearing fee retrocession paid by LCH.Clearnet for trades on the Euronext cash markets increased by 38% to 56.5 million in 2006 from 41.1 million in 2005, driven by an increase in trading volume. Listing fees Listing revenues decreased 12% from 63.1 million in 2005 to 55.6 million in 2006. The decrease was notwithstanding a very active primary market in 2006 and resulted from the existence of very large IPOs in 2005 (EDF and GDF in particular). There were 142 new listings on Euronext markets in 2006 as compared to 78 in 2005; due to the larger aggregate size of the new listings in 2005, however, admission and public offer fees decreased by 14.7% to 42.3 million. Of the new listings in 2006, 57 were listed on Alternext, which was rolled out during the year to Brussels and Amsterdam. Annual fees fell by 2% to 13.4 million in 2006, reflecting delistings or mergers during the year. At the end of 2006, 1,210 companies were listed on Euronext, representing a market capitalization of 2,812 billion euros. 118 Table of Contents Derivatives trading Revenue from derivatives trading increased by 18% to 391.6 million in 2006, driven primarily by higher volumes across the main markets and products and, to a lesser degree, by the launch in November 2005 of fully integrated transactional products, Afirm, Cscreen and Bclear. Overall, the increased volumes resulted from market volatility, strong cash markets activity and interest rate uncertainty. Overall volumes increased 21% to 730.3 million contracts traded in 2006, and average daily trading volume rose 21.5% to 2,863,934 contracts. The overall increase in volumes reflected very high volumes in the first half of the year and lower volumes in the second half, due to decreased market volatility. Trading revenues from interest rate products amounted to 235.8 million in 2006, a 21.9% increase over 2005. The increase was due to an 18.7% increase in the number of contracts traded to 412.2 million, itself due to higher volatility induced by on going speculation over interest rate trends (and in particular interest rate decisions of the European and UK central banks), and to a slight increase (from 56 to 57 cents) in the average fee per contract, itself resulting in part from the fact that the Euro dollar contract, which negatively affected results in 2005, was not offered in 2006. Equity derivatives trading revenues increased 19.5% to 122.5 million in 2006, of which 10.9 million related to OTC trading (via Bclear). Excluding Bclear, volumes increased by 3.1% to 255.9 million contracts. Bclear itself generated 51.6 million contracts traded in 2006, accounting for 89% of the overall volume increase in equity derivatives trading revenues. Commodity product trading revenues increased by 14.6% to 12.8 million in 2006, driven by a 15.9% increase in volume to a total of 9.9 million contracts traded. As a consequence of the change in the underlying contract sizes in the French market (which mechanically reduced the number of contracts traded), the clearing fee retrocession paid by LCH.Clearnet for continental derivatives trading decreased by 84.4% to 0.9 million in 2006. MTS Fixed income Euronexts share of MTS revenues amounted to 24 million in 2006. The corresponding revenues in 2005 during which MTS was proportionately consolidated for one month, were 1.4 million. On a comparable basis and for informational purposes only, MTS fixed income revenues increased by 2.4 % from 2005 to 2006. Settlement and custody The 62.9% decrease in settlement and custody revenues between the periods is due to the sale, effective January 1, 2006, of CIK, which had accounted for 24.5 million of revenues in 2005. Settlement and custody revenues in 2006, which amounted to 14.6 million, were generated solely by Interbolsa. These were 2% lower than those generated by Interbolsa in 2005, with higher volumes slightly offsetting lower prices under a new tariff structure implemented at the beginning of 2006. Information services Information services revenues increased 19.7% to 112 million in 2006. The increase resulted partly from revenues generated by newly consolidated companies (3.5 million from MTS and 2.7 million from Company News). The increase on a stand alone basis was 13.4% and was due mainly to a 6.4% increase in the number of both cash and derivatives terminals receiving Euronext data and to the full year positive effect of both a 5% price increase in the cash information services package and the harmonization of the derivatives information services packages implemented, respectively, in April and July 2005. 119 Table of Contents Sale of software The 5.4% decrease in revenue from the sale of software from 195.2 million in 2005 to 184.6 million in 2006 is due to the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS in July 2005; accordingly, 2006 revenues consist solely of GL TRADEs revenues and no longer of revenues from the licensing of LIFFE Connect. GL TRADEs revenues increased by 3% from 2005 to 2006, due in particular to acquisitions and organic growth in Asia, Eastern Europe and the US, mitigated by contract terminations in Europe. Other income Other revenues increased by 52.7% from 21.5 million to 32.9 million from 2005 to 2006. This is explained by the full year effect of services charged to AEMS in London, improved rental income in continental Europe and full year consolidation of MTS other revenues. Costs and expenses Euronexts total costs and expenses rose by 7.7% to 693.2 million in 2006. The following table summarizes the major components of costs and expenses for 2005 and 2006. Year ended December 31, %Change 2006/2005 2006 2005 (in thousands of euros) Salaries and employee benefits 275,385 264,360 4.2 % Depreciation 32,583 49,687 (34.4 )% IT expenses 166,176 139,772 18.9 % Office, telecom and consultancy 130,089 98,785 31.7 % Accommodation 44,358 50,111 (11.5 )% Marketing 20,295 15,586 30.2 % Other expenses 24,297 25,088 (3.2 )% Total costs and expenses 693,183 643,389 7.7 % Changes in scope of consolidation affecting costs The comparability of expenses between 2005 and 2006 is affected by several changes in scope of consolidation between the periods. Creation of Atos Euronext Market Solutions On July 22, 2005, Euronext formed Atos Euronext Market Solutions as a continuation and expansion of its existing AtosEuronext relationship with Atos Origin. The main assets Euronext contributed were the activities of LIFFE Market Solutions, the information technology division of its derivatives trading business Euronext.liffe (including Euronexts proprietary LIFFE CONNECT&reg; electronic trading system), and its 50% stake in AtosEuronext. Atos Origin contributed its own 50% share in AtosEuronext, plus other major assets from market related businesses, including middle and back office solutions, and its 51% stake in the connectivity platform Bourse Connect. The transfer of the activities of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS led to a significant reduction in Euronexts salaries and employee benefit costs, consultancy expenses, other office, telecom and consultancy costs and depreciation charges, and a parallel increase in IT expenses, which now include all IT expenses related to Euronext.liffe. The transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS represented in the aggregate a 9.9 million reduction in costs from 2005 to 2006. 120 Table of Contents Other changes As noted elsewhere, Euronext acquired MTS in November 2005 through a joint venture entity with Borsa Italiana, acquired 100% of Company News in March 2006 and sold CIK effective January 1, 2006. In the aggregate, newly consolidated MTS and Companynews added 20.4 million and 3.0 million in costs, respectively, for 2006, and the sale of CIK reduced costs by 17.4 million in such period. Salaries and employee benefits Staff costs increased by 4% from 264.4 million to 275.4 million in 2006. The increase resulted from the combination of the various changes in scope of consolidation (transfer to AEMS in July 2005, sale of CIK, acquisition of both MTS and Company News) and performance related compensation such as bonuses, which increased in line with the increased operating and net income of the Group, and higher incentive plan costs resulting from a sharp increase in Euronexts share price over the year. Overall workforce increased year on year from 2,302 to 2,324 FTE, due in particular to acquisitions and hiring by GL TRADE. On a constant basis and excluding GL TRADE, headcount decreased 5.2% to 1,169 FTE. Depreciation Depreciation expense amounted to 32.6 million in 2006, a 34% decrease from 49.7 million recorded in 2005. This is due primarily to the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions IT related tangible and intangible assets to AEMS as of July 1, 2005; depreciation expense related to these assets had amounted to 21.3 million in 2005. Excluding the effect of this transfer, depreciation expense increased by 4.2 million from period to period, due to the commencement of depreciation of various new software developments as well as the consolidation of MTS (1.1 million), which offset a 2.1 million decrease due to the sale of CIK. Information technology expenses IT expenses increased by 18.9% to 166.2 million in 2006 from 139.8 million in 2005. This increase resulted primarily from the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions activities to AEMS, which accounted for 35.1 million of additional IT costs. In addition, Euronexts share of IT expenses at MTS amounted to 9.9 million, as compared with 1.2 million in 2005 for December solely. These increases were partly offset by a 5.9 million decrease resulting from the sale of CIK. Excluding the effect of these changes in consolidation, IT costs decreased by 11 million, as the initial synergies following the creation of AEMS were generated. In particular, running costs (excluding GL TRADE) decreased by 6.6 million to 139.4 million and the lower number of actual development days contributed to 3.6 million of the decrease of IT expenses. Office, telecom and consultancy Office, telecom and consultancy expense increased 31.7% to 130.1 million in 2006. This increase resulted primarily from the incurrence of 47.6 million of costs relating to corporate transactions, in particular in connection with the NYSE Euronext transaction. While substantial corporate transaction costs had been incurred in 2005, relating in particular to the proposed transaction with the London Stock Exchange, the 2006 costs were considerably higher. These additional costs more than offset the reductions resulting from the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS and the sale of CIK (5.4 million and 1.5 million, respectively). Accommodation Accommodation costs decreased by 11.5% from 50.1 million to 44.4 million in 2006. This decrease resulted primarily from the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS and the sale of CIK (accounting for differences of 1.7 million and 0.6 million, respectively), a 1.4 million decrease in maintenance expenses and a 1.7 million decrease resulting from lease renegotiation and rationalisation. 121 Table of Contents Marketing Marketing costs increased 30.2% to 20.3 million in 2006, due to brand promotion advertising campaigns and advertising in support of specific initiatives in cash and derivatives activities. Other expenses Other costs decreased 3% to 24.3 million in 2006. This principal reason for the decrease was a 2.9 million reduction in VAT resulting from the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS, as well as a 1.2 million reduction in professional fees, which offset the additional costs induced by the inclusion of MTS and Companynews. Segment Operating Profit The following table provides information concerning segment operating profit on a euro basis and as a percentage of segment revenues for the periods indicated.

Revenues for this segment consist of Other income, as described above. Euronexts operating profit increased as a percentage of revenues from 33.1% in 2005 to 37.1% in 2006 in spite of the substantial one off expenses incurred in relation to corporate transactions as noted above. The substantial increases in the operating profit margins of the cash trading and derivatives trading segments resulted both from buoyant trading conditions and strict cost control, with both segments recording lower expenses. Information services continued its growth while listing declined due to the 2005 base effect (two exceptionally large transactions). Finally, Sale of software margin started to recover this year. 122 Table of Contents Other Items affecting Net Profit The following table summarizes the income statement line items below the line Profit from Operations for 2006 and 2005. Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 %Change 2006/2005 (in thousands of euros) (Restated) Profit from operations 409,008 318,478 28.4 % Net financing income 11,513 11,306 1.8 % Gain (loss) on sale of associates and activities 15,394 9,054 70.0 % Income from associates 53,739 18,456 191.1 % Subtotal 80,646 38,816 107.8 % Profit before tax 489,654 357,294 37.0 % Income tax (116,019 ) (103,931 ) 11.6 % Profit after tax 373,635 253,363 47.5 % Minority interests (11,856 ) (13,409 ) (11.6 )% Net profit attributable to the shareholders of parent company 361,779 239,954 +50.8 % Net financing income Net financing income increased slightly (by 1.8%) to 11.5 million in 2006. The substantial capital repayment paid to shareholders induced a drop of interest margin, which was largely offset by an increase in dividends received from financial investments. Gain (loss) on sale of associates and activities In 2006, Euronext recorded a gain of 15.4 million, relating primarily to the sale of CIK to Euroclear. The 2005 amount consisted of gains of 5.0 million and 4.1 million, respectively, on the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions and Bourse Connect to AEMS in July 2005. Income from associates Income from associates nearly tripled to 53.7 million in 2006. This increase resulted primarily from improved performance by LCH.Clearnet, which contributed 36.9 million of income in 2006. This contribution was made notwithstanding the recognition by LCH.Clearnet in the first half of 2006 of a 47.8 million charge to write off certain IT related assets (relating to its Generic Clearing System initiative), following a 20.1 million write off of assets related to such initiative in the first half of 2005. The contribution of AEMS amounted to 15.4 million, as compared with a total contribution from both Atos Euronext (in the first half of 2005), and AEMS (in the second half of 2005) of 4.9 million, reflecting the larger size of AEMS. Income tax expense Income tax expense increased from 103.4 million in 2005 to 116.0 million in 2006, primarily as a result of increased profit. Partially offsetting the effect of increased profitability was a 11 million adjustment, in light of the change in French tax law adopted in 2004, of Euronexts deferred tax assets relating to the sale of Clearnet to LCH.Clearnet to reflect a reduced capital gain tax rate applicable in 2007 when the related positions can be liquidated. 123 Table of Contents Minority interests Minority interests decreased by 11.6% primarily due to decreased net profits at GL TRADE and despite the presence of additional minority interest following the acquisition of MTS. Net profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company For the reasons discussed above, net profit rose by 50.8% to 361.8 million in 2006. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Revenues Euronexts total revenues increased by 8.5% from 886.8 million in 2004 to 961.9 million in 2005. The following table summarizes the composition of Euronexts revenues for 2004 and 2005. Year endedDecember 31, % Change2005/2004 2005 2004 (in thousandsof euros) Cash trading Trade execution fees, order fees and connection fees 174,624 156,437 11.6 % Clearing fee retrocession for cash trading 41,119 33,300 23.5 % Subtotal 215,743 189,737 13.7 % Listing fees 63,130 43,270 45.9 % Derivatives trading Order fees 326,125 317,549 2.7 % Clearing fee retrocession for continental derivatives trading 5,798 7,369 (21.3 )% Subtotal 331,923 324,918 2.2 % MTS fixed income 1,437 Settlement and custody 39,280 33,122 18.6 % Information services 93,592 87,297 7.2 % Sale of software 195,212 185,965 5.0 % Other income 21,550 22,528 (4.3 )% Total revenues 961,867 886,837 8.5 % Cash trading Revenue from cash trading increased by 13.7% to 215.7 million in 2005, due primarily to a strong recovery in market activity in the second half of 2005 that drove an 11.6% increase in trade execution fees, order fees and connection fees and a 23.5% increase in the related clearing fee retrocession for trades on the cash markets cleared by LCH.Clearnet. A record 155.5 million share transactions were executed on Euronexts cash markets in 2005, up 15.7% over 2004. The total number of trades in all cash products amounted to 162 million during 2005 (an increase of 15.0% over 2004), corresponding to a daily average of 632,000 trades (an increase of 15.8% over 2004). The recovery in market activity was driven primarily by a recovery in the confidence in the profitability of listed companies, as illustrated by rising indices, and a solid market for primary offerings, including some major initial public offerings. NextTrack, Euronexts tracker market segment, recorded a 28.5% increase in the number of transactions and a 38.0% increase in value traded during 2005, due in part to the creation of 40 new products 124 Table of Contents in 2005, which brought the total number of trackers to 95 at year end, as well as to the creation of partnerships with e brokers. The number of transactions (excluding cross trades) on NextWarrants, Euronexts segment for certificates and warrants, grew by 46% compared to 2004. Higher trading volumes were also encouraged by a new fee structure introduced in February 2005 that includes volume discounts designed to promote higher activity. Trade execution fees alone amounted to 163.1 million in 2005, an increase of 11.7% over 2004. The increase in trading volumes described above helped to offset a reduction in the average fee charged per trade (excluding liquidity provider trades), from 1.07 in 2004 to 1.03 in 2005. The clearing fee retrocession paid by LCH.Clearnet in 2005 increased by 23.5% to 41.1 million, compared to 33.3 million in 2004. The increase was driven by an increase in transaction values, as well as by an increase in trading volume. Listing fees Revenue from listing fees increased 45.9% to 63.1 million in 2005. This increase resulted primarily from a significant increase in admission fees, which more than doubled to 47.5 million in 2005. The increase in admission fees was driven by higher initial public offerings activity. 78 initial public offerings were completed during 2005, compared to 52 during 2004, raising 17.2 billion and adding 105 billion in additional market capitalization. Two of these initial public offerings those of EDF S.A. and GDF S.A. were among the largest in Europe in recent years. Of the 78 initial public offerings in 2005, 20 were listed on Alternext, a new exchange regulated market targeted at SMEs launched in May 2005. The increase in admission fees was also favorably affected by strong listing activity for warrants, with approximately 11,000 new warrants and certificates listed in 2005, up 4% compared to 2004. The increase in admission fees was partially offset by a decline in annual fees, which fell by 5% to 13.6 million in 2005, reflecting delistings during the year, principally by companies with listings in multiple markets. At the end of 2005, 1,259 companies were listed on Euronext, compared to 1,333 companies at the end of 2004. 966 of the companies listed at the end of 2005 were companies based in one of Euronexts home markets. Derivatives trading Revenue from derivatives trading increased 2.2% to 331.9 million in 2005, driven primarily by higher trading revenues from short term interest rate products and commodity derivatives, which more than offset a decrease in trading revenues from equity derivatives. In 2005, changes were made to the notional sizes of various contracts in response to customer demand. To enable year on year comparisons of changes in volume, 2004 volume figures below have been treated as if they were new style contracts by dividing their volumes by ten. Overall volumes (excluding call option dividend trading activity) were 7.0% higher in 2005, increasing from 566.1 million contracts in 2004 to 605.9 million in 2005. Volumes were higher in all major product categories: interest rate products increased by 10.8%, equity products by 2.1% and commodity products by 6.0%. Open interest stood at 78 million contracts, up 13% over 2004 (at 69 million contracts after rebasing of the underlying contract sizes in Paris, or 88.4 million without rebasing). Higher levels of open interest which consists of the total number of futures contracts or option contracts that have not yet been exercised, expired or fulfilled by delivery can be the source of revenue growth due to the likely management of these positions. Trading revenues from interest rate products amounted to 193.4 million in 2005, a 10% increase over 2004. Trading volumes in interest rate products ended the year 10.8% higher than in 2004, with more than 347 million 125 Table of Contents contracts traded, driven primarily by an increase in trading in the second half of the year due to higher volatility resulting from expected changes in the European Central Banks interest rate policy following a long period of stability. Equity derivatives trading revenues declined by 7.5% in 2005 to 102.4 million. Equity derivatives trading volume was 2.1% higher for the year, driven primarily by activity in the second half of the year due to higher volatility in the financial markets. The modest increase in overall volume for the year was more than offset by lower average fees, primarily reflecting the impact of fee decreases for single equity options introduced in November 2004. Commodity product revenues increased by 4.0% to 11.1 million in 2005, driven by a 6.0% increase in volume, increased rebates in London and a change in the business mix in Amsterdam. The clearing fee retrocession paid by LCH.Clearnet for continental derivatives trading in 2005 decreased by 21.3% to 5.8 million, primarily as a result of lower trading volumes in the Paris derivatives market and the change in the underlying contract sizes in the French market (which had the mechanical effect of reducing the number of contracts traded). MTS Fixed Income Euronext proportionately consolidated 51.0% of MTS (via MBE Holding) for one month in 2005, following its acquisition in late November, recording proportionately consolidated revenues of 1.4 million. Settlement and custody Revenues from settlement and custody services amounted to 39.3 million in 2005, an increase of 18.6% over 2004, driven primarily by higher indices, a strong performance in 2005 by new products launched by Euronext Brussels in 2004 and certain one off transactions (such as the restructuring of a Portuguese company) on Euronext Lisbon. Information services Revenue from information services increased 7.2% to 93.6 million in 2005, driven primarily by a 5% increase in fees charged for real time cash market data. Revenues were also positively affected by an increase in the number of end users in the financial services industry, the introduction of a harmonized derivatives trading data offering beginning in July 2005 and the launch of Euronexts Index File Service and NextHistory products. Sale of software Revenue from the sale of software increased 5.0% to 195.2 million in 2005, of which 179.3 million, or 91.8%, was generated by GL TRADE. The remaining 15.9 million of software revenues for 2005 were generated by licenses of the LIFFE CONNECT&reg; product by LIFFE Market Solutions prior to the contribution of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS in July 2005. GL TRADE generated revenues of 179.3 million in 2005, an increase of 29.3 million, or 18.8%, over 2004, primarily reflecting the positive impact of the November 2004 acquisition of Ubitrade S.A. and Davidge Inc. The increase in revenues resulted primarily from sales of risk management and back office product lines originally developed by Ubitrade, which generated 32.3 million of revenues in 2005. Of the Ubitrade product revenues, 13.0 million were attributable to the UBIX post trade derivatives product line, 4.4 million were attributable to the TRADIX risk management product line and 14.9 million (including non recurring license fees and a significant proportion of outsourced consulting services) were attributable to the FERMAT product line, a credit risk management tool that meets the requirements of the new Basel II regulatory regime for banking institutions. 126 Table of Contents The positive impact of the Ubitrade acquisition more than offset a decline in GL TRADEs revenues from its traditional front office business lines, which continued to be negatively affected by consolidation in the financial services sector, particularly in France and Italy, as this reduces GL TRADEs accessible client base. Front office revenues were also negatively affected by the decisions of several international financial institutions to shut down or reduce their trading operations in the UK and Italy. Overall, front office revenues declined by 1% to 133.4 million in 2005, a figure that also reflected in part the positive impact of new front office revenues generated by the Davidge acquisition. Although GL TRADE faced difficulties in its traditional European markets, sales of front office products in the Asia Pacific region recorded organic revenue growth of more than 19% in 2005. GL TRADEs expansion into Eastern Europe showed promising signs as well during 2005, recording revenues of nearly 1.5 million in Russia, where it opened an office at the end of 2005. In the United States, revenues increased by 52.0% compared to 2004, reflecting the integration of Ubitrade S.A., Davidge Inc. and OASIS. Other income Other income decreased 4.3% to 21.6 million in 2005, primarily reflecting a decrease in rental revenues following the termination of a sublease to LCH.Clearnet S.A. in Paris, and a 2.9 million decrease in transitional services fees collected from LCH.Clearnet due to its increased self sufficiency. These items were partially offset by 5.9 million in charges to AEMS during the six months beginning July 1, 2005. Costs and expenses Euronexts total costs and expenses decreased 6.3% to 643.4 million in 2005, primarily due to the fact that goodwill was no longer amortized as of January 1, 2005. The following table summarizes costs and expenses for 2004 and 2005. Year ended December 31, % Change2005/2004 2005 2004 (in thousandsof euros) Salaries and employee benefits 264,360 271,996 (2.8 )% Depreciation 49,687 67,386 (26.3 )% Goodwill amortization 39,875 IT expenses 139,772 129,336 8.1 % Office, telecom and consultancy 98,785 84,392 17.1 % Accommodation 50,111 50,990 (1.7 )% Marketing 15,586 15,250 2.2 % Other expenses 25,088 27,434 (8.6 )% Total costs and expenses 643,389 686,659 (6.3 )% Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits decreased 2.8% from 272.0 million in 2004 to 264.4 million in 2005, primarily as a result of a reduction in headcount at Euronexts operations other than MTS and GL TRADE. Euronext had 268 fewer full time employees in its operations other than MTS and GL TRADE at the end of 2005 than at the end of 2004, a reduction of 18.6% that resulted primarily from the transfer of 207 employees from LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS in July 2005. These headcount reductions more than offset the impact of a 17.1% (12.5 million) increase in GL TRADE staff costs, primarily reflecting the impact of a full year of staff costs from Ubitrade and Davidge compared to only one and two months, respectively, in 2004, and an increase of 2.1 million in stock option expense at Euronext and GL TRADE compared to 2004. 127 Table of Contents In late November 2005, Euronext acquired an indirect interest in MTS, which had 98 full time employees at the end of 2005. Depreciation Depreciation expense decreased by 17.7 million, or 26.3%, to 49.7 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions IT related tangible and intangible assets to AEMS as of July 1, 2005, which resulted in savings of 18.0 million. The decrease also reflects the recording in 2004 of a 9.0 million write off at Euronext.liffe following the migration of LIFFE CONNECT&reg;. These decreases were partially offset by the migration of the Euronext Amsterdam derivatives market from SWITCH to LIFFE CONNECT&reg; at the end of 2004 and various other capital expenditures that led to new depreciation charges in 2005. In addition, Euronext recorded 3.4 million in amortization of certain intangible assets in GL TRADE in 2005. Goodwill amortization Euronext adopted IFRS 3 for all business combinations agreed on or after March 31, 2004. Starting January 1, 2005, Euronext no longer amortizes goodwill relating to acquisitions made before March 31, 2004 as part of a business combination in line with IFRS 3. From January 1, 2005, goodwill is assessed periodically for impairment. Accordingly, there was no goodwill amortization expense in 2005. In 2004, goodwill amortization totaled 39.9 million and related primarily to Euronexts acquisition of LIFFE (24.9 million), the merger that led to Euronexts creation in September 2000 (9.1 million), and goodwill relating to Euronexts acquisition of BVLP (4.0 million). Information technology expenses IT expenses increased by 10.4 million, or 8.1%, to 139.8 million in 2005. This increase resulted primarily from the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions activities to AEMS, which accounted for 27.9 million in additional IT costs, and a 3.1 million increase in IT costs at GL TRADE during 2005 as a result of external growth. These increased expenses were partially offset by an aggregate 22.0 million decrease in other IT costs, resulting primarily from the completion of the derivatives market IT migration in Amsterdam in November 2004, which caused IT operating costs in continental Europe to fall by 16.4 million to 64.3 million in 2005, and a lower number of working days billed to Euronext for software development. Office, telecom and consultancy Office, telecom and consultancy expense increased 17.1% from 84.4 million in 2004 to 98.8 million in 2005, due to expenses relating to the envisaged acquisition of the London Stock Exchange (16.6 million) and external growth at GL TRADE (8.7 million). This increase was partially offset by a 6.0 million reduction in consultancy costs relating to the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS. Accommodation Accommodation costs decreased 1.7% to 50.1 million in 2005, primarily reflecting the full year impact of the termination of certain leases (one in Paris and six in London) as well as a number of new subletting contracts that helped to decrease costs. This decrease was partially offset by a 14.0% increase in accommodation costs at GL TRADE, stemming from its external growth. Marketing Marketing costs increased 2.2% from 15.3 million in 2004 to 15.6 million in 2005, due primarily to higher advertising and related costs in connection with the geographic expansion of Euronexts derivatives trading markets. 128 Table of Contents Other expenses Other expenses decreased 8.6% to 25.1 million in 2005, primarily reflecting lower expenses for non recoverable VAT and lower regulatory fees, partially offset by an increase in administrative costs and commissions.

Revenues for this segment consist of Other income, as described above. Euronexts operating profit increased as a percentage of revenues from 22.6% in 2004 to 33.1% in 2005. Revenues grew faster than costs and expenses in all segments other than the sale of software, where the decline in margins reflected in part, the impact of integrating Ubitrade and Davidge for the full year in 2005. In addition, as noted above, goodwill is no longer amortized beginning January 1, 2005. Other Items affecting Net Profit The following table summarizes the income statement line items below the line Profit from Operations for 2005 and 2004.

Gain on sale of associates and activities Euronext recorded gains of 5.0 million and 4.1 million on the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions and Bourse Connect, respectively, to AEMS in July 2005. In 2004, Euronext recorded a gain of 4.4 million on the sale of Cote Bleue S.A. Income from associates Income from associates increased from 3.3 million in 2004 to 18.5 million in 2005, which primarily reflected the absence during 2005 of goodwill amortization relating to the acquisition of LCH.Clearnet, since goodwill is no longer amortized under IFRS. In 2004, goodwill amortization relating to the acquisition of LCH.Clearnet amounted to 12.3 million. The increase in income from associates during 2005 was also partially due to an increased contribution from AEMS. AEMS contributed 5.0 million in 2005, compared to the 1.9 million contribution from AtosEuronext in 2004, largely reflecting the larger size of AEMS. This increase was partially offset by a lower contribution from Bourse Connect during 2005 of 0.9 million (compared to 1.5 million in 2004), which was contributed to AEMS in July 2005. Income tax expense Income tax expense increased from 54.8 million in 2004 to 104.0 million in 2005, primarily as a result of increased profit for Euronext. In addition, during 2004 the French government enacted legislation through which the capital gains tax will be reduced in the years up to 2007. As a result, Euronexts deferred tax positions were adjusted in 2004 to reflect the expected tax rates when the related positions could be liquidated. This resulted in a 27.3 million reduction in income tax expense for 2004. Minority interests Minority interests increased by 21.7% primarily due to increased net profits of GL TRADE. Net profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company For the reasons discussed above, net profit after goodwill amortization, tax and minority interests, increased 60.2% from 149.7 million in 2004 to 239.9 million in 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Euronexts primary uses of funds are for capital expenditures, working capital, dividend payments, share repurchases under its share repurchase program and repayment or refinancing of debt. Euronext has historically met these requirements through a combination of cash generated by operating activities and short and long term debt. Euronext believes these sources of funds will continue to be adequate to meet its currently anticipated funds requirements. In addition, in order to expand its business, Euronext may make other strategic acquisitions or enter into business combinations, joint ventures or other strategic partnership arrangements with other companies (including other securities exchanges). Any such transaction (particularly an acquisition or similar business combination) may involve the payment of consideration in the form of cash, shares or other securities, or a combination of both. Euronext has had, and expects to continue to have, discussions with numerous third parties regarding potential strategic alliances. As of the date hereof, Euronext has not entered into any definitive agreement for an acquisition or other business combination, other than as described herein. 130 Table of Contents Sources of Funds Euronexts principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand, short term financial investments and cash flow from operating activities. At December 31, 2006, Euronext had cash and cash equivalents of 416.3 million and short term financial investments of 168.2 million; these amounts were respectively 429.5 million and 265.1 million at December 31, 2005. As at December 31, 2006, the Groups net assets classified as held for sale amounted to 456.6 million (506.3 million in assets and 49.7 million in liabilities), relating almost entirely to ordinary shares and redeemable, convertible preference shares in LCH.Clearnet that are expected to be repurchased or redeemed by LCH.Clearnet under an agreement with the company. At December 31, 2005, the Groups net asset classified as held for amounted to 10.6 million. Euronext generated positive cash flows from operating activities of 315.5 million in 2006 compared to 259.5 million in 2005. Euronext believes that it is well positioned to access the bank lending and capital markets in the event it would require additional financing. Standard & Poors and Moodys have assigned ratings of AA and Aa3, respectively, to Euronext. In 2004, Euronext issued &pound;250 million 5.125% fixed rate bonds that mature on June 16, 2009. This issuance refinanced the syndicated bank loan that Euronext had contracted in 2001 to finance its acquisition of LIFFE. In 2006, Euronext obtained a 5 year multi currency 300 million revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, of which 86.4 million was drawn down at December 31, 2006. In addition, GL TRADE has contracted bank facilities for an outstanding amount of 16 million at December 31, 2006 (9 million maturing in June 2009 and 7 million maturing in August 2011). Uses of Funds Capital Expenditures Euronexts capital expenditures (which primarily related to software and equipment) decreased from 41.3 million in 2005 (which included several large projects) to 35.6 million in 2006. Investments either in progress or with respect to which Euronext has made firm commitments to incur in 2007 amount to approximately 16 million. Acquisitions In 2006, Euronext acquired additional shares of MTS for 12.6 million in cash, CompanyNews Group S.A. for 5.5 million in cash, and Hugin for 18.9 million in cash. In addition, GL TRADE acquired NYFIX overseas for 7.1 million in cash and Emos Systems for 4.8 million in cash. All acquisitions were funded using operating cash flows. Dividends and Share Repurchase Programs Euronexts has paid dividends in each year since its formation in 2000. In 2006, Euronext paid dividends of 111.4 million and implemented a share capital repayment of 333.8 million. Working Capital Euronexts working capital requirements decreased by 16.7 million in 2006. At the end of 2006, Euronext had a working capital surplus of 100.3 million, equal to 1.1 months of revenues compared to 1.7 months in 2005. Debt and Minority Put Options Euronexts financing policy is aimed at financing the growth of its business and ensuring that it is financially flexible while maintaining a strong balance sheet. The indebtedness mainly consists of (i) the June 2009 &pound;250.0 million Bonds issued in 2004 to refinance the acquisition of LIFFE, (ii) a 300 million revolving 131 Table of Contents bank loan of which 86.4 million was drawn at the end of 2006, and (iii) outstanding 16 million bank loans contracted by GL TRADE. None of these loans contain any financial covenants or other provisions that could lead to early redemption, other than customary events of default and change of control provisions. The 300 million revolving credit facility permits a change of control of Euronext in certain circumstances. The credit agreement also contemplates that following such a change of control, Euronext may undertake certain steps by way of reorganization which will result in an affiliate of Euronext acceding to the credit agreement in place of Euronext. Such accession is subject to the prior consent of the majority lenders, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed if specified conditions are satisfied. A permitted change of control or reorganization will only trigger a mandatory prepayment if, after the change of control or reorganization, the long term credit ratings assigned to Euronext by Standard & Poors and Moodys are, respectively, below A and below A3 or neither Standard & Poors nor Moodys assigns a long term credit rating to Euronext. In addition, Euronext has granted Borsa Italiana a put option on its 49.0% stake in MBE Holding. The option is exercisable at any time until 2010. As Euronext and Borsa Italiana jointly control MBE Holding, the put option is treated as a derivative financial instrument. The fair value of this option is determined as the difference between the estimated exercise price and 49.0% of the enterprise value determined on the basis of a discounted cash flow method. When the exercise price exceeds the enterprise value, a liability is recognized. At December 31, 2006, the estimated exercise price did not exceed the enterprise value, so no liability was recognized. Euronext has also granted a put option to GL TRADE founders on up to 10.5% of GL TRADEs share capital. The option can be exercised at any moment between February 28, 2006 and June 10, 2024. The exercise price has been set at the average market value of the previous 40 trading days, less 1 euro. The present value of the exercise price of the option (35.2 million on December 31, 2006) is reflected as a current financial liability. GL TRADE has granted put options to minority shareholders of the companies Glesia, which GL TRADE controls. The present value of the exercise price of the options (5.7 million and 0.9 million respectively) is reflected on the balance sheet as a financial liability under IFRS. Contractual Obligations Euronext has various contractual obligations arising from its operations. These obligations are more fully described in this document under various headings under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition of Euronext as well as in the notes to Euronexts consolidated financial statements. The following table lists the aggregate maturities of Euronexts long term debt and operating leases at December 31, 2006: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 years 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years After 5 years In thousands of euros Long Term Debt Obligations (before interest) 475,097 97,782 377,315 Operating Lease Obligations 22,804 11,485 1,472 227 9,620 Total 497,901 109,267 378,787 227 9,620 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In July 2005, GL TRADE acquired OASIS for $4 million. The acquisition price may be increased by up to $3 million until June 30, 2007, depending on the income growth recorded by this company. In August 2006, GL TRADE acquired Nyfix overseas for $9 million. The acquisition price may be increased by up to $6 million, depending on the companys revenues during the period from the acquisition to December 31, 2007. 132 Table of Contents In June 2006, Euronext, together with Atos Origin, granted an ordinary course unlimited parent guarantee to Atos Euronext Market Solutions in respect of payments related to a building lease in the UK. Euronext estimates its total exposure under this guarantee at &pound;11.5 million. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing its financial statements, Euronext makes estimates concerning a variety of matters. Some of these matters are highly uncertain, and Euronexts estimates involve judgments it makes based on the information available to it. The following discussion highlights Euronexts critical accounting policies and estimates. Euronext considers an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it involves significant judgments and estimates on the part of Euronexts management and changes to those judgments or estimates could have a material impact on Euronexts financial presentation. The discussion below addresses only those estimates that Euronext considers most important based on the degree of uncertainty and the likelihood of a material impact if a different estimate were used. There are other areas in which Euronext uses estimates about uncertain matters, but for which the reasonably likely effect of changed or different estimates is not material to Euronexts financial presentation. For a summary of all of Euronexts significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to Euronexts consolidated financial statements. Pension plan assumptions Euronext recognizes its net obligation in respect of its defined benefit pension plans on the basis of an actuarial estimate of the future benefit that employees have earned as of the balance sheet date, net of the valuation of assets to meet these obligations. Euronext prepares this estimate on an annual basis taking into account different actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions used are the discount rate (equal to the yield at the balance sheet date on high quality fixed income instruments) on future benefits and the expected return on plan assets. Euronext evaluates these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan specific and country specific basis. Other assumptions relate to demographic factors, such as retirement age, life expectancy and staff turnover, which are periodically evaluated and updated to reflect Euronexts past experience and future expectations. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, Euronexts pension benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. Impairment testing Rather than being amortized, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually under IFRS, or more frequently when there is an indication of an impairment loss. Goodwill is tested at the level of cash generating units, which correspond to Euronext businesses that generate independent cash flows. The impairment test is based on the relationship between the carrying amount of an asset and its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its sale price or value in use. Value in use is in turn based on the discounted future cash flows method. The determination of the underlying assumptions related to the recoverability of intangible assets is subjective, and therefore requires the exercise of considerable judgment by Euronext. Although Euronext performs sensitivity analyses on its main assumptions in order to strengthen the reliability of its impairment tests, changes in key assumptions about Euronexts business and prospects, or changes in market conditions, could result in future impairment charges. Valuation of Available for Sale securities Investments in Available for Sale securities are carried at fair value. The determination of such fair values is performed either by reference to quoted market prices when these are available or by using a valuation technique. Valuation techniques may encompass elements of discounted cash flow analysis, and therefore require the exercise of judgment by Euronext. Although Euronext performs sensitivity analyses on its main assumptions in order to strengthen the reliability of its calculations, changes in key assumptions could result in different fair values. 133 Table of Contents Share based compensation In accordance with IFRS 2, the grant of stock options to employees for services rendered represents a supplementary benefit provided by Euronext. Under IFRS 2, Euronext estimates the fair value of these stock options at the grant date and records the value within shareholders equity. Fair value is determined using a Black and Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the specific features of the stock option plan (net price, period of exercise, etc.), market data at the grant date (such as price, volatility, etc.) and behavioral assumptions relating to option holders. Different assumptions could result in material changes to the expense amounts recorded for these options. Contingent liabilities Euronext is involved in legal and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. Euronext accrues a liability in its financial statements when an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such matters, it is often difficult to predict the final outcome. The cases and claims against Euronext often raise difficult and complex issues. In determining whether a loss should be accrued Euronext evaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Assessing these matters inherently involves the exercise of significant management judgment. Changes in these factors or outcomes that are different from those Euronext expects to occur could materially impact Euronexts financial position or its results of operations. Summary of Differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP Euronext prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, which differ in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP. The principal differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP as they relate to Euronext are discussed in Note 3.12 to Euronexts consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. These notes include a reconciliation of net income and shareholders equity under IFRS to net income and shareholders equity under U.S. GAAP. The most significant items in reconciling Euronexts net income and shareholders equity under IFRS and U.S. GAAP related to impairment and amortization of goodwill and intangible assets, recognition of admission fees and sale of software revenues, accounting for derivatives and hedging instruments, deferred tax relate to business combinations and employee benefits and stock based compensation. Further information on such differences and adjustments is set forth in the notes to Euronexts consolidated financial statements mentioned above. Net income under U.S. GAAP amounted to 329.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, up from 221.1 million in 2005. This corresponds to a 49% increase in net income under U.S. GAAP, compared to the 47% increase in net income under IFRS. The increase in US GAAP adjustments between 2005 and 2006 is mainly due to the adoption since January 1, 2006 of SFAS 123 R Share Based Payment using the prospective method. This led to the reclassification of Euronext stock option awards granted in 2004, which were previously classified as an equity instrument under APB 25, as a liability due to conditions in the awards that are not included in the service, performance or market conditions as described in FAS 123(R). This is the source of the increase in adjustments relating to share based payments from (5,704) million in 2005 to (25,507) in 2006. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK NYSE GROUP Market risk represents the risks of changes in the fair value of financial instruments, derivative or non derivative, caused by fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices. Our primary market risk is associated with fluctuations in interest rates and the effects that such fluctuations may have on our investment portfolio. As 134 Table of Contents of December 31, 2006, investments consist of fixed income instruments with an average duration of 0.9 years and mutual funds. The portfolio investment objective is to invest in securities to preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. These investment securities are subject to interest rate risk and their fair values may fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Management does not believe that a 100 basis point fluctuation in market interest rates would have a material effect on income or cash flows from, or the carrying value of, the investment portfolios as of December 31, 2006. NYSE Group does not believe that it has material exposure to interest rate or foreign currency risks as of December 31, 2006. As part of the credit facility arrangement with the contemplated merger with Euronext, the commercial paper will be issued in the most cost effective currency. The commercial paper will be monitored for interest and foreign currency risks. Furthermore, NYSE Group has not entered into any derivative contracts to mitigate market, interest rate or foreign currency risks as of December 31, 2006. Euronext General As a result of its operating and financing activities, Euronext is exposed to market risks such as changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, as well as equity market risks. Euronext has implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures within the group, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies (Risk Committee, Managing Board or Audit Committee, as appropriate). Euronexts treasury and financing department is charged with identifying risk exposures and monitoring and managing such risks on a daily basis. Euronexts subsidiaries centralize their cash investments, report their risks and hedge their exposures with the groups central treasury and financing department as necessary in accordance with local law. Euronext uses derivative instruments solely to hedge financial risks related to its financial positions or risks that are otherwise incurred in the normal course of its commercial activities. It does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Euronexts principal derivative instrument at December 31, 2006 was a fixed to floating rate swap entered into to hedge its fixed rate bonds issued in 2004. The following table summarizes the composition of Euronexts financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2006. Currency Positions in euros Positions in pound sterling Type of rate and maturity Floating rate (or fixed rate with maturity &lt; 1 year) Fixed rate (with maturity &gt; 1 year) Floating rate (or fixed rate with maturity &lt; 1 year) Fixed rate (with maturity &gt; 1 year) In thousands of euros Financial assets 348,004 217,868 Financial liabilities 130,406 27,987 367,192 Net position before hedging 217,598 189,881 (367,192 ) Hedging impact (367,192 )(*) 367,192 (*) Net position after hedging 217,598 (177,311 ) (*) Fixed rate to floating rate swap hedging the fixed rate bond. 135 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the composition of Euronexts financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2005. Currency Positions in euros Positions in pound sterling Type of rate and maturity Floating rate (or fixed rate with maturity &lt; 1 year) Fixed rate (with maturity &gt; 1 year) Floating rate (or fixed rate with maturity &lt; 1 year) Fixed rate (with maturity &gt; 1 year) In thousands of euros Financial assets 391,586 282,548 Financial liabilities 12,273 5,652 368,157 Net position before hedging 379,313 276,896 (368,157 ) Hedging impact (368,157 )(*) 368,157 (*) Net position after hedging 379,313 (91,261 ) (*) Fixed rate to floating rate swap hedging a fixed rate bond. Interest Rate Risk Substantially all of Euronexts financial assets and liabilities are based on floating rates or on fixed rates that have been swapped to floating rates via fixed to floating rate swaps. As part of its hedging activities, Euronext enters into over the counter interest rate derivative instruments, such as swaps, with counterparties that meet minimum creditworthiness and rating standards. As reflected in the table above, Euronext has entered into a fixed to floating rate swap to hedge a &pound;250 million fixed rate bond issuance denominated in sterling. Because Euronext is a net lender at floating rate in euros, when interest rates on euro denominated instruments decrease, Euronexts financing income is negatively impacted. Assuming constant levels of euro denominated net financial assets at floating rate or at fixed rate with a maturity of less than one year, Euronexts annual financing income would decrease by 2.2 million for each 1% decrease in euro interest rates based on positions at December 31, 2006 (3.8 million for each 1% decrease in euro interest rates based on positions at December 31, 2005). Similarly, because Euronext is a net borrower at floating rate in sterling, when interest rates on sterling denominated instruments increase, Euronexts financing expenses increase. Assuming constant levels of sterling denominated net financial liabilities at floating rate or at fixed rate with a maturity of less than one year, Euronexts annual financing expense would increase by 1.8 million for each 1% increase in sterling interest rates based on positions at December 31, 2006 (0.9 million for each 1% increase in sterling interest rates based on positions at December 31, 2005). Currency risk As a result of Euronexts acquisition of LIFFE, a significant part of Euronexts assets, liabilities, income and expenses of Euronext is recorded in pound sterling, exposing Euronext to a currency risk. When the euro increases in value against the pound sterling, for example, revenues denominated in pound sterling generate a reduced contribution to Euronexts consolidated revenues when translated into euros. Similarly, when the euro decreases in value against the pound sterling, the impact of expenses denominated in pounds sterling is greater when translated into euros. In 2006, 32.4% of Euronexts revenues and 28.4% of its expenses were denominated in pounds sterling. At December 31, 2006, the Groups net currency position was &pound;264 million, consisting of &pound;565 million in assets (including &pound;291 million goodwill) and &pound;301 million in liabilities. The borrowings in pounds sterling, for an amount of &pound;264 million, constitute a partial hedge of the net assets in pounds sterling. The currency exchange rate differences had a positive impact of 7.6 million on the Groups consolidated equity in 2006. At December 31, 2006, based on the &pound;264 million net currency position of the group, a hypothetical 10% increase in the euro/sterling exchange rate would have had a negative 35.7 million impact on shareholders equity. 136 Table of Contents At December 31, 2005, Euronexts net currency position was &pound;284 million, consisting of &pound;579 million in assets (including &pound;291 million of goodwill and &pound;192 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term financial investments) and &pound;295 million in liabilities. The borrowings in pounds sterling, for an amount of &pound;254 million, constitute a partial hedge of the net assets in pounds sterling. Currency exchange rate differences had a positive impact of 12.5 million on the groups consolidated equity in 2005. At December 31, 2005, based on the &pound;284 million net currency position of the group, a hypothetical 10% increase in the euro/sterling exchange rate would have had a negative 37.7 million impact on shareholders equity. Equity market risk Euronext is exposed to equity market risk through its investment in shares of Atos Origin S.A., which were valued at 14.6 million as of December 31, 2006 (18.1 million as of December 31, 2005). A decrease in the value of Atos Origin shares could lead to a financial loss for Euronext. This position is monitored and reported to senior management on a daily basis. At December 31, 2006, all else being equal, a hypothetical 10% decline in the market price of the shares of Atos Origin would have had a 1.5 million impact on the fair value of Euronexts investment in Atos Origin (1.8 million based on the position at December 31, 2005). Until the end of 2005, variations in the fair value of these shares were recorded in financing income (revaluation of asset at fair value through profit and loss) under IFRS and in equity (other comprehensive income) under U.S. GAAP. Following an amendment to IAS 39 that took effect on January 1, 2006 which limits the possibility of designating a financial asset or liability as one at fair value through profit and loss upon initial recognition, Euronexts equity investment in Atos Origin has been reclassified as an available for sale asset. Accordingly, variations in the fair value of these shares are now recognized in equity for both IFRS and U.S. GAAP. 137 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF NYSE GROUP The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of NYSE Group and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document. The following discussion contains forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. See Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. Certain prior period amounts presented in the discussion and analysis have been reclassified to conform to the 2006 presentation. Overview NYSE Group was organized on May 2, 2005. As of December 31, 2005 and up until March 7, 2006, NYSE Group had no assets (other than $200 it received on December 29, 2005 from the sale of one share of its common stock to each of the NYSE and Archipelago) and had not conducted any material activities other than those incidental to its formation. However, on March 7, 2006, upon the consummation of the merger of the NYSE and Archipelago, NYSE Group became the parent company of the NYSE and Archipelago. Basis of Presentation NYSE Group has treated the merger of the NYSE and Archipelago as a purchase business combination for accounting purposes, with the NYSE designated as the business and accounting acquirer. As a result, the historical results of the NYSE have become the historical results of NYSE Group, as its successor. The results of operations of NYSE Arca have been included in the results of operations of NYSE Group since March 8, 2006. Recent Developments On April 26, 2007, NYSE Euronext announced NYSE Groups unaudited financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2007. The revenues for this period were $702.0 million (inclusive of activity assessment fees of $185.6 million), an increase of $247.1 million, or 54.3%, from revenues of $454.9 million (inclusive of activity assessment fees of $139.2 million) for the comparable period a year ago. Due to the fact that the combination between NYSE Group and Euronext N.V. was consummated on April 4, 2007, first quarter 2007 results included the full quarter results from the operations of NYSE Group only; the operations of Euronext are not included in the first quarter results of NYSE Group. First quarter 2007 results included $11.1 million in merger expenses consisting of professional and other fees incurred in connection with both the acquisition of the Archipelago businesses and the recently completed combination with Euronext N.V. ($4.6 million), and exit costs associated with the previously announced trading floor consolidation ($6.5 million). Also included in the first quarter results was a $12.8 million curtailment gain related to the elimination of certain employee post retirement benefits. This non recurring gain partially offset $15.2 million in charges incurred by NYSE Group for the routing of customer orders from the NYSE to other market centers for the period from January 2 through March 2, 2007. Commencing March 5, 2007, consistent with industry practice, the NYSE implemented new routing fees to mitigate the expenses incurred from other market centers. As a result, NYSE Group reported net income of $67.6 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2007, an increase of $37.3 million, or 123%, compared to net income of $30.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the comparable period a year ago. 86 Table of Contents Business Development NYSE/Archipelago Merger On April 20, 2005, the NYSE entered into a definitive merger agreement with Archipelago, pursuant to which the NYSE and Archipelago agreed to combine their businesses and became wholly owned subsidiaries of NYSE Group, a newly created, for profit and publicly traded holding company. The merger closed on March 7, 2006. As of that date, the NYSE and Archipelago became wholly owned subsidiaries of NYSE Group. Selling Shareholder Offering On May 10, 2006, NYSE Group completed a selling shareholder offering of 28.75 million shares of common stock at $61.50 per share, for which NYSE Group received no proceeds. Combination with Euronext N.V. On May 22, 2006, NYSE Group proposed a business combination with Euronext to create NYSE Euronext. Euronext is a cross border exchange providing international services for regulated cash markets and derivative markets in Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Portugal. Both parties signed a definitive combination agreement on June 1, 2006, which was amended and restated on November 24, 2006. The combination closed on April 4, 2007. Purchase of Minority Interest in SIAC On November 1, 2006, NYSE Group completed the purchase of the one third ownership stake in SIAC previously held by AMEX for approximately $40.3 million, as a result of which NYSE Group now fully owns SIAC. Consolidate Member Regulation Operations On November 28, 2006, NYSE Group and NASD announced the signing of a letter of intent to consolidate each of their member regulation operations into an SRO that will be the private sector regulator for all securities broker dealers doing business with the public in the United States. The transaction is not expected to have material financial consequences for NYSE Group. The new SRO, which will be named at a later date, is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2007. MatchPoint Trading, Inc. On July 17, 2006, NYSE Group acquired MatchPoint Trading Inc. (MatchPoint), a financial services technology company specializing in call market trading and technologies. Marco Polo Network Inc. On September 18, 2006, NYSE Group announced that it had acquired an equity stake in Marco Polo Network Inc. (Marco Polo). Through its local exchange and brokerage relationships, Marco Polo offers intra market connectivity and routing to brokers and exchanges in more than 40 emerging markets. TransactTools, Inc. On January 8, 2007, NYSE Group acquired TransactTools Inc. (TransactTools), a company providing enterprise messaging solutions for the securities trading industry. Tokyo Stock Exchange On January 31, 2007, NYSE Group and Tokyo Stock Exchange signed a letter of intent that establishes a strategic alliance between the two world financial market leaders to jointly develop and explore new opportunities in trading systems and technology, investor and issuer services, investment products, and governance and regulation. 87 Table of Contents National Stock Exchange of India Limited On April 4, 2007, NYSE Group acquired a 5% equity position in the Mumbai based National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE), the maximum investment permitted by any investor in a stock exchange under the securities regulations of India. NYSE Group purchased the shares of NSE for $115.0 million in cash from a consortium of selling shareholders. Business Environment In recent years, the business environment in which NYSE Group operates has been characterized by challenging business and economic conditions. Ongoing regulatory developments, increasing scrutiny of execution costs, unbundling of financial services and enhancements in trading and trade processing technology have created an unprecedented level of competition in the provision of trade execution and related services. In addition, changes in market related legislation have affected the capital raising process in the United States and abroad. The business environment in which NYSE Group operates has been characterized by the following trends: increased global competition; greater emphasis on faster and more cost efficient trade execution; increased demand for transparency and stronger corporate growth; growth in trade volumes; and regulatory developments, including Regulation NMS. This environment has affected NYSE Groups business and the components of its results of operations, and is likely to affect the NYSE Groups results to varying degrees in the future. In particular, these business, economic, regulatory and competitive conditions affect: overall trading volume in NYSE Group listed securities; the prices that NYSE Group can charge its member organizations for trade execution and other trade related services provided by NYSE Group; domestic and non U.S. companies decisions to raise capital through an issuance of shares that would be listed on the markets operated by NYSE Group; and whether companies that are listed on another market will transfer their listing to the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc or whether listed companies will remain listed on the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc. For more concerning these trends and developments, see Item 1. Business Market Trends and Developments. Segment Reporting Subsequent to the merger between the NYSE and Archipelago and the minority interest purchase of SIAC, NYSE Group operates under two reportable segments: Market and Regulation. NYSE Groups segments are managed and operated as two business units and organized based on services provided to customers. Market represents primarily the fees earned from: (i) obtaining new listings and servicing existing listings on the NYSE and NYSE Arca, Inc.; (ii) providing access to trade execution; (iii) distributing market information to data subscribers; (iv) issuing trading licenses (previously membership fees); and (v) providing communication and data processing operations via SIAC. Regulation provides regulatory services (including member firm regulation, market surveillance, enforcement, listed company compliance, and arbitration), performed by NYSE Regulation, to the NYSE and to NYSE Arca. Regulatory fees are paid by member organizations and are primarily assessed based upon their Gross FOCUS revenues. In addition, Regulation collects fines that are assessed against members, member organizations and their employees in disciplinary actions brought by Regulation. 88 Table of Contents Operating Data (unaudited) NYSE Group revenues are affected by many factors, including the number of companies listed on the NYSE and NYSE Arca, Inc. (both new and continuing), corporate actions by these companies (for example, stock splits and mergers), trading activity, demand for data processing, and demand for market information. The following table presents selected operating data for the periods presented. A description of the manner in which the NYSE and NYSE Arca calculate their trading volumes and other operating measures is set forth below.

NYSE Group share of Tape C represents the average of: (i) the share of qualifying trades for Tape C reported by the NYSE Group to the consolidated tape, as compared to the total number of qualifying trades for Tape C reported to the consolidated tape by all other participating market centers; and (ii) the share of qualifying share volume for Tape C reported by the NYSE Group to the consolidated tape, as compared to the total qualifying share volume for Tape C reported by all other participating market centers. The consolidated tape refers to the collection of market data that multiple markets make available on a consolidated basis. (10) Gross FOCUS revenues represent a fee of $0.42 per $1,000, of gross revenues generated by member broker dealers as reported on their FOCUS report (a report that is required to be filed with the NYSE). A member broker dealers regulatory fee is based on the revenues reported. The NYSE records revenue on a six month lag; the data is provided on this basis. Sources of Revenues Activity Assessment Fees The NYSE and NYSE Arca, Inc. pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These Section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. NYSE Group, in turn, collects activity assessment fees from member organizations executing trades on the NYSE and NYSE Arca, Inc. and recognizes these amounts when invoiced. Fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees. As a result, neither the size of activity assessment fees or the Section 31 fees has an impact on NYSE Groups net income. Transaction NYSE Prior to August 1, 2006, on the NYSE, trading fees were paid by member organizations based on their trading activity. Fees were assessed on a per share basis for trading in equity securities. The fees applied to all transactions that took place on the NYSE, and the fee amounts varied, based on the size and type of trade consummated. There was no fee for small electronic trades. All members and member organizations paid trading fees except those $2 brokers who effect transactions only for other member organizations and specialists. There were two caps that applied to the trading fees (other than fees for trading ETFs), and member organizations paid the lesser of these two fee caps on a monthly basis. The first cap was a maximum fixed dollar amount of $600,000 per month. The second was a variable cap equal to 2% of the net commissions that a member organization earned on the trades it executed on the trading floor. As a result of these caps, prior to August 1, 2006, fluctuations in trading volumes, regardless of direction or magnitude, did not have a significant impact on NYSE Groups trading fees. 90 Table of Contents NYSE Arca On NYSE Arca, trading fees are charged to customers for trade execution of equity securities and equity options. NYSE Arca earns transaction fees for (i) customer orders of equity securities matched internally on NYSE Arca, as well as for customer orders routed out, and (ii) customer orders of equity options traded or cleared through NYSE Arca. For equity securities, NYSE Arca charges a per share fee to each customer that executes against a buy order or sell order posted internally. NYSE Arca refers to these customers when they purchase or sell securities as liquidity takers, as they removed liquidity from NYSE Arca. A liquidity taker may be either a purchaser or a seller, and is distinguished from a liquidity provider generally by the type of buy order or sell order it posts on NYSE Arca. NYSE Arca also charges a per share fee to customers whose orders of equity securities are routed out to an external market center displaying the best buy order or sell order in the market for a particular security. Price Changes On August 1, 2006, October 1, 2006 and November 30, 2006, NYSE Group implemented transaction pricing changes for NYSE listed equities and NYSE Arca, Inc. traded options. Currently, pricing for NYSE listed equities includes, but is not limited to, the following: Transaction fees on NYSE listed equities traded on the NYSE are based on a fixed rate of $0.000275 per share. Fees for ETF system orders traded on the NYSE under 5,100 shares continue to be waived. Specialists do not incur transaction fees for trading ETFs on the NYSE. NYSE Arcas rates for trading NYSE listed securities are as follows: (i) the rate for removing liquidity from NYSE Arca increased from $0.001 per share to $0.003 per share; and (ii) NYSE Arca rebates $0.002 per share for the provision of liquidity. These fees are consistent with those NYSE Arca charges for trading Nasdaq and Amex listed securities. In addition, as of March 5, 2007, for orders pertaining to NYSE listed equities that are routed to other market centers for execution, the NYSE charges a rate of $0.0025 per share. Currently, pricing for NYSE Arca, Inc. traded options includes, but is not limited to, the following: transaction fees for Market Makers are $0.16 per contract; transaction fees for Lead Market Makers are $0.09 per contract; and transaction fees for Electronic Broker Dealer transactions are $0.50 per contract. In addition, the rate schedule for electronic executions in penny pilot issues will credit trading participants for providing liquidity by providing resting orders/quotes and assess a per contract fee to trading participants that take liquidity. Credits will be as high as $0.30 per contract and fees will be as high as $0.50 per contract. In addition, as a component of the November 30, 2006 announced pricing changes, the NYSE will implement a revenue sharing program, commencing June 1, 2007, that will provide variable payments to specialist firms depending on performance. See Components of Expenses Liquidity Payments for a discussion of revenue sharing programs. The pricing structures of the NYSE and NYSE Arca continue to undergo a fundamental examination as part of a broad strategic review of the NYSE Groups opportunities for revenue growth and efficiency improvement and to better capture value for the services rendered by aligning more closely transaction revenue with executed volume, product expansion and new product development. Transaction fees that NYSE Group earns in the future could also depend on the outcome of certain regulations and rule changes, such as Regulation NMS. 91 Table of Contents Listing Companies pay listing fees when they initially list on the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc., and annually thereafter. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and other corporate action related fees. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of securities that the company initially lists with the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new securities to be listed on the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc., such as stock splits, rights issues, sales of additional securities, and mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee. Annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding securities of the listed company at the end of the previous year. Non U.S. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the United States. Annual fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original listing fees are recognized on a straight line basis over estimated service periods of 10 years for the NYSE and 5 years for NYSE Arca. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Data Processing SIAC charges data processing fees to customers other than NYSE Group (fees charged to NYSE Group are eliminated in consolidation) for communication services, data processing operations and systems development functions. SIACs core business operates on a cost recovery model driven by its customers demands. Under this model, any increase or decrease in SIACs operating expenses results in a corresponding change in its revenues. In addition, SIAC earns revenues through its subsidiary, Sector, which offers an array of communications and data processing services, primarily to the broker dealer community. Market Data NYSE Group collects market information fees principally for consortium based data products and, to a lesser extent, for NYSE proprietary data products. Consortium based data fees are determined by securities industry plans. Consortium based data revenues that coordinated market data distribution generates (net of administration costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of their respective percentage of trades. Last sale prices and quotes in NYSE listed securities are disseminated through Tape A, which constitutes the majority of the NYSEs revenues from consortium based market data revenues. NYSE Group also receives a share of the revenues from Tape B and Tape C, which represents data related to trading of certain securities (including ETFs) that are listed on AMEX, other regional exchanges and Nasdaq. These revenues are influenced by demand for the data by professional and non professional subscribers, as well as NYSE Groups share of trades. In addition, NYSE Group receives fees for television broadcasts, vendor access and other usage fees related to use of data. NYSE Group proprietary products make available market data covering activity that takes place solely on the NYSE and NYSE Arcas markets, independent of activity on other markets. Regulatory Regulatory fees are principally comprised of member regulation fees and market surveillance fees collected by NYSE Group. Member regulation fees are based on a percentage of member organizations gross FOCUS revenues, specifically $0.42 per $1,000 of gross revenues generated by member broker dealers and reported on a six month lag basis. In addition, member regulation fees include initial and annual maintenance fees for branch office registration and registered persons and testing fees. Market surveillance fees are charged to specialists and floor brokers to recover some of the costs of overseeing trading on the NYSE floor. Licensing, Facility and Other For fiscal 2006, NYSE Group sold 1,274 trading licenses at an annual price of $49,290. For fiscal 2007, NYSE Group sold 1,065 trading licenses at an annual price of $50,000 per license. The NYSE had made available a maximum of 1,366 trading licenses. 92 Table of Contents Facility and other fees primarily comprise fees received for services provided to specialists, brokers and clerks physically located on the NYSE floor that enable them to engage in the purchase and sale of securities on the trading floor. These services include booth and post space, communication, trading analysis and technology. Components of Expenses Section 31 Fees See Sources of Revenues Activity Assessment Fees above. Merger Expenses and Exit Costs Merger expenses and exit costs consist of severance costs, curtailment losses, depreciation charges related to the acceleration of certain fixed asset useful lives, as well as legal and other expenses directly attributable either to the merger between the NYSE and Archipelago or the pending combination transaction with Euronext. It also includes legal, printing and accounting fees incurred in connection with the May 2006 selling shareholder offering of our common stock as this was a condition of the Archipelago merger. Compensation NYSE Groups compensation expense includes employee salaries, incentive compensation (including stock based compensation) and related benefits expense, including pension, medical, post retirement medical, and supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) charges. Part time help, primarily related to security personnel at the NYSE, is also recorded as part of compensation. Liquidity Payments To enhance the liquidity of its system, NYSE Arca pays a small fee per share to participants, referred to as liquidity providers, that post buy orders and sell orders on NYSE Arca, when the quote is executed against by liquidity takers purchasing or selling securities internally on NYSE Arca. In addition, effective December 1, 2006, the NYSE implemented a specialist rebate as part of its new pricing structure. Routing and Clearing NYSE Group incurs routing charges when the NYSE or NYSE Arca do not have the best buy or sell order in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on the NYSE or NYSE Arca. In that case, NYSE Group routes the customers order to the external market center that displays the best buy order or sell order. The external market center charges the NYSE or NYSE Arca a fee per share for routing to its system. Also, NYSE Arca incurs clearance, brokerage and related transaction expenses, which primarily include costs incurred in self clearing activities, service fees paid per trade to exchanges for trade execution, and costs incurred due to erroneous trade execution. Systems and Communications NYSE Groups systems and communications expense includes: (i) certain costs for development and maintenance of trading, regulatory and administrative systems; (ii) investments in system capacity, reliability and security and (iii) network connection with its customers and its data centers, as well as connectivity to various other market centers. Professional Services NYSE Groups professional services expense includes consulting charges related to various technological and operational initiatives, as well as legal and audit fees. Our historical spending related to professional services consists principally of legal and consulting expenses. While we are focused on reducing costs, including 93 Table of Contents professional services costs, we cannot assure you that our professional services expenses will decline in the future. Under certain circumstances, particularly as we pursue our business strategy, we may be required to incur significant professional services costs, such as legal expenses. Depreciation and Amortization This item includes costs from depreciating fixed assets and amortizing intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. It also includes depreciation of computer hardware and capitalized software. Occupancy Occupancy includes costs related to NYSE Groups leased premises, as well as real estate taxes and maintenance of owned premises. Marketing and Other Marketing and other expenses includes advertising, printing and promotion expenses, insurance premiums, travel and entertainment expenses as well as other administrative expenses. Regulatory Fine Income Regulatory fine income is generated from fines levied by NYSE Regulation, which regulates and monitors the activities on our securities exchanges and enforces issuer and member organization compliance with applicable law and the rules of the exchanges. The frequency in which fines may be levied and their amount will vary based upon the actions of participants on the NYSE and NYSE Arca. Regulatory fines are used for regulatory purposes. Pending the closing of the consolidation of certain NYSE Regulation functions with the NASD, we expect that NYSE Regulation will continue to levy fines for regulatory purposes as appropriate. We anticipate that regulatory fine income will decrease following the closing of the consolidation. 94 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2006 versus Year Ended December 31, 2005 Overview The following table sets forth NYSE Groups consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each consolidated statement of income item for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2005.

For the same period a year ago, the results of operations of NYSE Group only included the results of NYSE and SIAC. For the year ended December 31, 2006, NYSE Group reported revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), operating income and net income of $1,702.8 million, $233.5 million and $205.0 million, respectively. This compares to revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), operating income and net income of $1,038.6 million, $43.6 million and $40.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005. 95 Table of Contents The $664.2 million increase in revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), $189.9 million increase in operating income and $164.2 million increase in net income for the period reflect the following principal factors. Increased revenues NYSE Arca results of operations were consolidated from the March 7, 2006 merger with Archipelago and contributed revenues of $594.1 million (excluding activity assessment fees), which was the primary driver of the period over period increase. Increased operating income The period over period increase in operating income of $189.9 million was the result of NYSE Arcas contribution to operating income of $134.2 million as well as other revenue growth and overall operating efficiencies as we continue to meet our integration goals. Improved net income Period over period, net income increased $164.2 million including $86.9 million related to NYSE Arca, due to revenue growth and overall operating efficiencies. Segment Results Subsequent to the merger between the NYSE and Archipelago and the minority interest purchase of SIAC, NYSE Group operates under two reportable segments: Market and Regulation. NYSE Groups segments are managed and operated as two business units and organized based on services provided to customers. Market represents primarily the fees earned from: (i) obtaining new listings and servicing existing listings on the NYSE and NYSE Arca, Inc.; (ii) providing access to trade execution; (iii) distributing market information to data subscribers; (iv) issuing trading licenses (previously membership fees) and (v) via SIAC providing communication and data processing operations. Regulation provides regulatory services (including member firm regulation, market surveillance, enforcement, listed company compliance, and arbitration), performed by NYSE Regulation, to the NYSE and to NYSE Arca. Regulatory fees are paid by member organizations and are primarily assessed based upon their Gross FOCUS revenues. In addition, NYSE Regulation collects regulatory fines that are imposed upon members and member organizations and their employees.

Listing The following table sets forth the revenues from listing fees calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (as reported) and as would be reported on a basis without giving effect to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (billed basis). NYSE Group believes that the 96 Table of Contents presentation of billed basis revenues, as they relate to original fees, is a good indicator of current listing fee activity as billed basis information excludes the effects of recognizing revenues related to original fees over periods ranging from 5 to 10 years. Year ended December 31, Percent Increase(Decrease) 2006 2005 Dollars (in Millions) Asreported Asbilled Asreported Asbilled Asreported Asbilled Annual fees $ 265.8 $ 265.8 $ 252.2 $ 252.2 5.4 % 5.4 % Original fees 90.3 80.2 90.5 83.9 (0.2 )% (4.4 )% $ 356.1 $ 346.0 $ 342.7 $ 336.1 3.9 % 2.9 % For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, listing fee revenue increased $13.4 million, or 3.9%, on an as reported basis. Listing fees are primarily derived from annual listing fees and original listing fees. Original listing fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated service periods ranging from 5 to 10 years. The difference between the as reported revenues and the billed basis revenues is due to the amortization of listing fees in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Annual listing fees totaled $265.8 million on both an as reported and billed basis for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with $252.2 million on both an as reported and billed basis for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 5.4%. The period over period improvement is due to the increase in aggregate shares billed at the beginning of the year, from approximately 387 billion to 408 billion, as well as new listings of shares during the year, which generate annual fees for the period of the year listed. Annual listing fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original listing fees amounted to $90.3 million on an as reported basis. On a billed basis, original listing fees totaled $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of $3.7 million, or 4.4%, compared to the as billed original listing fees for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to a change in pricing and a reduction of corporate actions period over period. Market Data For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, market data fees increased $44.3 million, or 24.9%, primarily from the contribution of NYSE Arcas operations, following the completion of the merger between the NYSE and Archipelago on March 7, 2006. Data processing For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, data processing fees decreased $45.8 million, or 25.0%, to $137.1million. The decline is due to reduced level of services provided by SIAC to customers other than the NYSE. Market services provided to Regulation For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, market services provided to Regulation increased $2.1 million, or 1.7%. These services, which include costs associated with supporting IT infrastructure, finance, human resources and other administrative functions, are provided by Market to support the operations of Regulation. Licensing, facility and other For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, licensing and facility fees increased $70.6 million, or 125.2%. Licensing fees represented $51.4 million of the increase. NYSE Group did not generate licensing fees in the same period a year ago. Also driving the increase was increased specialist trading privilege fees of $11.0 million as compared to the same period a year ago. As part of the NYSEs new pricing structure, the specialist trading privilege fee was discontinued in December 2006. 97 Table of Contents Regulation Segment Results Revenues Year ended December 31, PercentIncrease(Decrease) Dollars (in Millions) 2006 2005 Regulatory $ 184.2 $ 132.6 38.9 % Regulatory services provided to Market 127.9 119.9 6.7 % Total revenues $ 312.1 $ 252.5 23.6 % Regulatory Fees For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, regulatory fees increased $51.6 million, or 38.9%, to $184.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, NYSE Arca contributed regulatory fees of $9.2 million. The remaining $42.4 million increase was primarily due to higher reported Gross FOCUS revenues ($284.0 billion compared to $186.5 billion period over period). Regulatory services provided to Market For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, regulatory services provided to Market increased $8.0 million or 6.7%. These services, which include costs associated with surveillance, examination and enforcement with respect to Market activities, and overseeing compliance by listed companies, are provided by Regulation. The increase primarily reflects increased compensation costs for cash awards granted to Regulation employees following the merger between the NYSE and Archipelago.

Excluding the impact of both NYSE Arcas consolidation and stock based compensation charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2006, compensation decreased by $63.8 million primarily due to cost savings initiatives. NYSE Group did not record any stock based compensation in the same period a year ago. Liquidity payments. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Market incurred liquidity payments of $264.9 million. The operations of NYSE Arca represented $256.1 million with the remaining $8.8 million reflecting a specialist rebate for NYSE listed stocks implemented effective December 1, 2006. NYSE Group did not incur any similar expenses in the same period a year ago. Routing and clearing. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Market incurred routing and clearing fees of $74.4 million, including $66.2 million from the operations of NYSE Arca. NYSE Group did not incur any similar expenses in the same period a year ago. Additionally, commencing in the fourth quarter, NYSE Group was charged for trades routed out to other exchanges via the Intermarket Trading System. Regulatory services provided to Market. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, Regulation support costs increased $8.0 million or 6.7%. The increase primarily reflects increased compensation costs for cash awards granted to Regulation employees following the merger with Archipelago. Systems and communications. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, systems costs decreased $4.8 million, or 3.9%. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the operations of NYSE Arca accounted for $19.8 million of the $118.1 million of systems and communications. Excluding the operations of NYSE Arca, systems and communications expenses decreased by 20.0% to $98.3 million due to structural cost effectiveness efforts. Professional Services. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, professional services decreased $19.7 million or 16.5%. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the operations of NYSE Arca accounted for $11.8 million of the $99.8 million of professional services. The decrease was primarily due to reduced legal fees and the achievement of certain integration synergies. Depreciation and Amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, depreciation and amortization increased $32.4 million, or 32.8%. The operations of NYSE Arca represented $29.6 million of the increase following the March 7, 2006 merger with Archipelago. The remaining $2.8 million increase was associated with recent capital expenditures on technology and infrastructure. Occupancy. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, occupancy costs increased $15.2 million or 25.6%, which was primarily the result of the consolidation of NYSE Arcas operations following the completion of the March 7, 2006 merger with Archipelago. 99 Table of Contents Marketing and other. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, marketing and other expenses increased $34.5 million, or 57.0%. The operations of NYSE Arca accounted for $15.7 million of the increase following the March 7, 2006 merger with Archipelago. The remaining $18.8 million increase was primarily a result of discretionary advertising and promotion activities, as well as higher insurance premiums and additional expenses incurred as a public company.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, compensation increased $11.4 million, or 10.0%, to $125.4 million. This increase was primarily due to the $10.2 million of cash awards granted to NYSE employees at the time of the merger with Archipelago. Excluding the cash awards compensation increased $1.2 million due to increased salaries offset by decreased benefits associated with changes to the benefit plans. Market services provided to Regulation. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, market support costs increased $2.1 million, or 1.7%. Professional services. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, professional services increased $8.1 million to $10.6 million. These costs increased as newly established mandatory regulatory audits commenced during 2006. Regulations other operating expenses, including systems and communications, depreciation and amortization as well as marketing and other expenses were relatively stable period over period. Regulatory Fine Income For the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, fine income increased $1.0 million to $36.4 million. Regulatory fines result from actions taken by Regulation in its oversight of Market constituents and accordingly may vary period over period. 100 Table of Contents Investment and Other Income, Net The components of investment and other income, net, were as follows: Year ended December 31, Dollars (in Millions) 2006 2005 Investment income, net $ 40.7 $ 34.8 DTCC settlement gain 10.8 Other 22.5 12.5 Total $ 74.0 $ 47.3 The increase in investment income, net, is primarily attributable to an increase in the average interest bearing investment portfolio and higher interest rates. DTCC settlement gain reflects a one time payment from certain subsidiaries of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) in connection with the termination of their service agreement with SIAC. NYSE Groups share (net of minority interest of $3.6 million) of the one time settlement gain was $7.2 million. Insurance claims are contingent on various factors and accordingly may vary period to period. Gain on Sale of Equity Investment During 2006, NYSE Group sold DTCC shares of common stock it held for a $23.4 million cash payment. NYSE Group carried this investment at its $2.5 million cost and therefore realized a $20.9 million pre tax gain. The after tax impact of this gain was included in the cash dividend paid to each former NYSE members in connection with the March 7, 2006 merger of NYSE and Archipelago. Income Taxes The consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was 36.7% and 53.0%, respectively. The 2005 effective tax rate was significantly higher than the standard rate due to non deductible merger related expenses for litigation. The 2006 effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily as a result of federal and state tax credits. 101 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2005 versus December 31, 2004 The following table sets forth NYSE Groups consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each consolidated statement of income item for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2004.

This compares to revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), operating income and net income of $1,045.7 million, $12.9 million and $30.2 million, respectively. The $7.1 million decrease in revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), $30.7 million increase in operating income and $10.6 million increase in net income for the period reflect the following principal factors: Decreased revenues. The period over period decrease in revenues of $7.1 million was primarily driven by reduced data processing fees partially offset by growth in many key businesses. Increased operating income. The period over period increase in operating income of $30.7 million was the result of ongoing cost reduction initiatives offset by merger expense and exit costs from the merger with Archipelago. Improved net income. Period over period, net income increased $10.6 million, primarily reflecting cost reduction initiatives. 102 Table of Contents Market Segment Results Revenues Year ended December 31, PercentIncrease(Decrease) Dollars (in Millions) 2005 2004 Activity assessment $ 594.6 $ 359.8 65.3 % Transaction 145.8 153.6 (5.1 )% Listing 342.7 329.8 3.9 % Market data 178.2 167.6 6.3 % Data processing 182.9 220.2 (16.9 )% Market services provided to Regulation 123.4 121.5 1.6 % Licensing, facility and other 56.4 59.3 (4.9 )% Total revenues $ 1,624.0 $ 1,411.8 15.0 % Transaction For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, transaction fees decreased by $7.8 million, or 5.1%. Although NYSE Group listed average daily volume was up 9.0%, pricing structures in place during 2005 relating to dollar caps inhibited the NYSE Groups ability to generate revenue growth. Partially offsetting this decline in revenue was an increase in revenue derived from ETF transactions. These revenues increased 136.3% as compared to 2004 as the trading activity increased from 236 million shares during 2004 to 926 million shares for 2005. Listing The following table sets forth the revenues from listing fees calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (as reported) and as would be reported on a basis without giving effect to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (billed basis). NYSE Group believes that the presentation of billed basis revenues, as they relate to original fees, is a good indicator of current listing fee activity as billed basis information excludes the effects of recognizing revenues related to original fees over 10 years. Year ended December 31, Percent Increase(Decrease) (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 Asreported Asbilled Asreported Asbilled Asreported Asbilled Annual fees $ 252.2 $ 252.2 $ 241.3 $ 241.3 4.5 % 4.5 % Original fees 90.5 83.9 88.5 79.6 2.3 % 5.4 % $ 342.7 $ 336.1 $ 329.8 $ 320.9 3.9 % 4.8 % For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, listing fee revenue increased $12.9 million, or 3.9%, on an as reported basis. Listing fees are primarily derived from annual listing fees and original listing fees. For the periods presented, original listing fees were deferred and recognized over an estimated service period of 10 years. The difference between the as reported revenues and the billed basis revenues is due to the amortization of listing fees in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Annual listing fees totaled $252.2 million on both an as reported and billed basis for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $241.3 million on both an as reported and billed basis for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 4.5%. The period over period improvement is due to the increase in aggregate shares billed at the beginning of the year, from approximately 355 billion to 387 billion, as well as new listings of shares during the year, which generate annual fees for the period of the year listed. Annual listing fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. 103 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2005, original listing fees amounted to $90.5 million on an as reported basis. On a billed basis, original listing fees totaled $83.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with $79.6 million in 2004, a 5.4% increase. Original listings of operating companies, closed end funds and ETFs increased year over year from 165 to 192, which drove the increase in original fees billed. Market data For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, market data fees increased $10.6 million, or 6.3%. The number of non professional users increased by 13.4% year over year. The demand for NYSE OpenBook&reg;, NYSE Groups proprietary data product, continued to increase, as the number of subscribers was 17.5% higher than the same period a year ago causing increased open book revenue of 24.7% to $21.2 million. NYSE Groups non recurring revenue of $5.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 comprises (i) charges for customers who had previously not reported the appropriate number of professional devices in use and (ii) an allowance for doubtful accounts reduction. In the normal course of business, NYSE Group audits its customers and the number of devices they report (on which it generates its billing) and adjusts its records based on the audit results, if necessary. This can lead to both increases and decreases in current billings. Additionally, NYSE Groups allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced after a review of its policy for reserving market data revenues, and based on current levels of recoveries and collections, which have improved over the past year. Somewhat offsetting the increase in market information fees was the NYSEs share of trades decreasing period over period, from 90.6% to 87.5%. Data processing For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, data processing fees decreased $37.3 million, or 16.9%, due to decreases in services provided by SIAC to customers other than the NYSE and lower revenues from the communications services of Sector, Inc. Market services provided to Regulation For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, market services provided to Regulation increased $1.9 million, or 1.6%. These services, which include costs associated with supporting IT infrastructure, finance, human resources and other administrative functions, are provided by Market to support the operations of Regulation. Licensing, facility and other For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, licensing and facility fees decreased $2.9 million, or 4.9%. The decrease was due to fewer electronic access member renewals period over period and lower electronic access member prices.

Member regulation fees drove the increase for the year due to higher reported gross FOCUS revenues ($186.5 billion in 2005 as compared to $145.6 billion in 2004). Regulatory services provided to Market For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, regulatory services provided to Market remained relatively unchanged.

Marketing and other. For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, marketing and other expenses decreased $16.8 million, or 21.7%. Cost savings initiatives in 2005 led to the reductions, consisting of decreased advertising, travel and entertainment expenses and decreased contributions to various organizations. Regulation Segment Results Expenses Year ended December 31, PercentIncrease(Decrease) Dollars (in Millions) 2005 2004 Compensation $ 114.0 $ 99.3 14.8 % Market services provided to Regulation 123.4 121.5 1.6 % Systems and communications 1.4 8.2 (82.9 )% Professional services 2.5 2.4 4.2 % Depreciation and amortization 4.7 3.7 27.0 % Occupancy 10.4 8.5 22.4 % Marketing and other 7.5 7.5 Total expenses $ 263.9 $ 251.1 5.1 % Regulation Compensation Year ended December 31, PercentIncrease(Decrease) Dollars (in Millions) 2005 2004 Salaries and bonus $ 84.9 $ 74.8 13.5 % Benefits and other 29.1 24.5 18.8 % $ 114.0 $ 99.3 14.8 % Compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, compensation increased $14.7 million, or 14.8%, to $114.0 million. This is primarily the result from increased headcount to 710 from 656 employees period over period. In addition, average salaries increased 4.9% in 2005. Market services provided to Regulation. For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, market support costs increased $1.9 million, or 1.6%, primarily as a result of allocated systems and communications expenses. Systems and communications. For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, systems and communications decreased $6.8 million, or 82.9%. Starting in 2005, Market incurred systems and communications expenses on behalf of Regulation, which were allocated to Regulation through Market services provided to Regulation. Depreciation and amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, depreciation and amortization increased $1.0 million, or 27.0% due to increased level of furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements associated with increased headcount and space. Occupancy. For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, occupancy increased $1.9 million, or 22.4% due to the increase in the amount of space utilized by Regulation. 106 Table of Contents Regulations other operating expenses, including professional services and marketing and other expenses were relatively stable period over period. Regulatory Fine Income For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, fine income increased $27.8 million to $35.4 million. Regulatory fines result from actions taken by Regulation in its oversight of Market constituents and accordingly may vary period over period. Investment and Other Income, Net The components of investment and other income, net, were as follows: Year ended December 31, Dollars (in Millions) 2005 2004 Investment income, net $ 34.8 $ 17.2 Other 12.5 13.2 Total $ 47.3 $ 30.4 The increase in investment income, net, was primarily driven by higher investment income due to (i) the effect of a portfolio reallocation initiated in December 2004 to higher yielding and more tax efficient securities, (ii) a more favorable interest rate environment for investments over the same period in the prior year, and (iii) realized gains on certain investments. Insurance claims are contingent on various factors and accordingly may vary period to period. Income Taxes The consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was 53.0% and 28.0%, respectively. The year over year increase was a result of non deductible merger related legal costs and factors impacting the tax provision relating to deferred tax items and other tax credits. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, NYSE Groups primary source of liquidity has been cash generated by NYSE Groups operations, and NYSE Groups liquidity requirements have been for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate use. NYSE Groups working capital was $610.9 million at December 31, 2006, and capital expenditures equaled $97.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Capital expenditures related primarily to the development and maintenance of corporate and regulatory systems and to trading technology, including expenditures relating to the development and implementation of NYSE Hybrid Market and compliance with Regulation NMS. Cash and cash equivalents are generated primarily from listing services, sales of market information, collection of activity assessment fees (which are fully remitted to the SEC), data processing services provided by SIAC, collections of regulatory fees, fees generated for trading, and investment income. At December 31, 2006, NYSE Group had $277.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $234.2 million from its cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2005. Current assets readily convertible into cash include accounts receivable, securities purchased under agreements to resell and marketable securities. These assets totaled $1,036.2 million at December 31, 2006 and, when combined with cash and cash equivalents, represented 91.0% of NYSE Groups current assets. 107 Table of Contents Under the terms of the operating agreement of the NYSE, no regulatory fees, fines or penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be distributed to NYSE Group or any entity other than NYSE Regulation. As a result, the use of regulatory fees, fines and penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be considered restricted. As of December 31, 2006, NYSE Group did not have any significant restricted cash balance. With respect to investment activities, the boards of directors of NYSE Group has an approved investment policy for externally managed portfolios. The goal of this policy is to preserve principal, maintain adequate liquidity at all times, fund budgeted operating and capital requirements, and to maximize returns relative to investing guidelines and market conditions. NYSE Groups current policy prevents it from investing directly in any equity type investment; however, this policy can be modified at the discretion of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of NYSE Group, based on the delegation of authority by the board of directors. Under NYSE Groups policy, it may invest only in securities that are rated AA or better by two nationally recognized rating organizations and that are in U.S. dollar denominations. The average duration of the portfolio must not exceed two years. NYSE Group periodically reviews our respective policies and investment managers. Also included in the investment portfolio are investments which are used to fund non qualified benefit obligations. The participants of these plans, supplemental executive savings and other deferred compensation plans, are permitted to invest in equity funds. As of December 31, 2006, NYSE Group had no outstanding short term or long term debt. In connection with the exchange offer, NYSE Euronext, as the borrower, and NYSE Group, as the guarantor (until completion of the combination), entered into a 2.5 billion revolving credit bridge facility, on January 5, 2007. NYSE Euronext may only borrow amounts under this bridge facility agreement to fund the cash portion of the consideration being offered to Euronext shareholders in the exchange offer. NYSE Euronext, with NYSE Group as guarantor (until completion of the combination), also intends to enter into a $3.0 billion syndicated revolving credit facility, which is expected to be used primarily as a backstop for a global commercial paper program. The proceeds from the global commercial paper program will be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of amounts borrowed under the bridge facility and or the syndicated revolving credit facility. The bridge facility includes and the syndicated revolving credit facility is expected to include terms and conditions customary for agreements of this type, which may restrict NYSE Euronexts ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness. NYSE Group believes that cash flows from operating activities and financing capabilities along with future cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet the needs of its current operations. If existing cash balances are insufficient, NYSE Group intends to seek additional financing. NYSE Group may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. Net cash provided by operating activities equaled $218.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, consisting of net income of $205.0 million and the effects of non cash items, such as depreciation, which does not adversely affect cash flows. Net cash provided by investing activities equaled $505.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. NYSE Group acquired $218.2 million of cash in connection with the Archipelago merger. Net sales of investment securities and securities purchased under agreements to resell of $410.9 million funded the $409.8 million distribution to NYSE former members. As part of the merger with Archipelago, NYSE Groups financing activities included a total cash distribution of $506.2 million (consisting of a $409.8 million cash distribution and a $96.4 million dividend) to the NYSEs former members during the year ended December 31, 2006. 108 Table of Contents Summary Disclosures About Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes NYSE Groups future minimum lease obligations on its operating and capital leases as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Payments due by year Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Operating lease obligations $ 298,060 $ 63,903 $ 50,932 $ 41,928 $ 36,967 $ 23,622 $ 80,708 Capital lease obligations(1) 17,906 8,722 7,676 1,337 94 77 Total $ 315,966 $ 72,625 $ 58,608 $ 43,265 $ 37,061 $ 23,699 $ 80,708 (1) The capital lease payments also include interest payable of approximately $2.5 million. NYSE Group also has obligations related to the deferred compensation and other post retirement benefits. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined. See notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following provides information about NYSE Groups critical accounting estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Revenue Recognition Companies pay listing fees when they initially list on the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc. and annually thereafter. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and other corporate action related fees. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company initially lists with the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be listed on the NYSE or NYSE Arca, Inc., such as stock splits, right issues, sales of additional securities, and mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee. Annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of the listed company at the end of the previous year. These fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original listing fees are recognized on a straight line basis over their estimated service periods of 10 years for the NYSE and 5 years for NYSE Arca, Inc. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management believes to be sufficient to absorb probable losses in NYSE Groups accounts receivable portfolio and is assessed periodically by management. Increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged against operating results and it is decreased by the amount of charge offs, net of recoveries. The allowance is based on several factors, including a continuous assessment of the collectibility of each account. In circumstances where a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations is known, NYSE Group records a specific provision for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected. Accounts with outstanding balances in excess of 60 to 90 days are reviewed monthly to make changes to the allowance as appropriate. Income Taxes NYSE Group records income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. 109 Table of Contents Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and tax bases in assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided for certain tax carryforwards. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. NYSE Group is subject to numerous domestic jurisdictions primarily based on our operations in these jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in NYSE Groups financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could have material impact on NYSE Groups financial position or results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Employee Benefits (OPEB) In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans (collectively benefit plans) to recognize the funded status of their benefit plans in the statement of financial position, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end statement of financial condition, and provide additional disclosures. On December 31, 2006, NYSE Group adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158. The effect of adopting SFAS 158 on NYSE Groups financial condition at December 31, 2006 has been included in the consolidated financial statements. Pension and OPEB costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect NYSE Groups pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets NYSE Group reviews the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based upon estimated fair value of NYSE Groups reporting units. Should the review indicate that goodwill is impaired, NYSE Groups goodwill would be reduced by the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its fair value. NYSE Group reviews the useful life of its indefinite lived intangible assets to determine whether events of circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life. In addition, the carrying value of NYSE Groups other intangible assets is reviewed by NYSE Group on at least an annual basis for impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the asset. NYSE Group performed its annual impairment tests as of December 31, 2006, which indicated that no impairment charge was required for goodwill, indefinite lived intangible assets or intangible assets. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of assets is provided for using the straight line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 2 to 15 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Gains or losses related to retirements or disposition of fixed assets are recognized in the period incurred. NYSE Group accounts for software development costs under AICPA Statement of Position 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use (SOP 98 1), and other related guidance. NYSE Group expenses software development costs incurred during the preliminary 110 Table of Contents project stage, while it capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage, which includes design, coding, installation and testing activities. Amortization of capitalized software development costs is computed on a straight line basis over the softwares estimated useful life, generally three years. Stock Based Compensation NYSE Group adopted SFAS 123R, Share Based Payment, during the first quarter of 2006. SFAS 123R required that compensation expense associated with share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. SFAS 123R also required that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow. Compensation expense is based on the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the grant date and recognized ratably over the vesting period. NYSE Group estimates an expected forfeiture rate while recognizing the expense associated with these awards. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Uncertain Tax Positions In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of Statement of Financial Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 addresses how a reporting company accounts for all tax positions including the uncertain tax positions reflected or expected to be reflected in the companys past or future tax returns. The interpretation also requires the company to recognize interest and penalties associated with the uncertain tax positions. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that the implementation of FIN 48 will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. SAB 108 In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current year Financial Statements (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006 and it allows a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings for errors that were not previously deemed material, but are material under the guidance in SAB 108. Prior to 2006, NYSE relied on license holders (former members) to self report transaction volume and remit payment for the related transaction fees on a one month lag. Starting in December 2006, NYSE Group commenced billing license holders for trading activity brought to the floor of the NYSE. As a result, NYSE Group eliminated the one month lag in recognizing NYSE related transaction revenues. However, instead of recording both the self reported November transaction fees and the accrued December transaction fees in the December 2006 results of operations (which would have resulted in reporting 13 months of transaction fee revenue in fiscal 2006), NYSE Group elected to increase its January 1, 2006, retained earnings by approximately $6.6 million, which corresponds to the impact of the thirteenth month of transaction fee revenues, net of related income taxes. Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS 157 provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable. SFAS 157 also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value, and the effect of the fair value measures on earnings. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the implementation of SFAS 157 will have on our financial statements. 111 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF EURONEXT The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Euronexts audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 included herein. Euronexts consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. IFRS differ in certain material respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. For a discussion of certain material differences between IFRS and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, see Summary of Material Differences Between IFRS and U.S. GAAP below and the related notes in Euronexts consolidated financial statements. Overview Since it was founded in 2000, Euronext has been committed to promoting the integration and consolidation of Europes capital markets and increasing the efficiency of cross border trading. In pursuit of that objective, Euronext has pursued opportunities to consolidate and integrate its markets, most notably through the adoption of a harmonized rulebook and the integration of the Groups trading platforms through a four year migration plan that was completed in 2004. These efforts, combined with Euronexts efforts to streamline its organizational structure to create a cross border, business oriented organization based on strategic business units, have allowed Euronext to reduce operating costs and to eliminate redundancies. As a result of a good performance by both trading and Information services activities, as well as Euronexts continued efforts to keep operating costs under strict control, net income increased from 149.7 in 2004 to 240.0 million in 2005 and to 361.8 million in 2006. The changes in net income during the period under review primarily reflected changes in profit from operations, which increase from 200.1 million in 2004 to 318.5 million in 2005 and to 409.0 million in 2006. Over the period, Euronexts profit from operations increased as a percentage of revenues from 22.6% in 2004 to 33.1% in 2005 and to 37.1 % in 2006. Sources of Revenue and Principal Expense Items Operating revenues Cash trading Euronext generates cash trading revenue from fees charged primarily for the execution of trades of equity and debt securities and other cash instruments on Euronexts cash market, which is comprised of the separate cash markets operated in Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and Lisbon. For historical reasons relating to Euronexts prior ownership of Clearnet, part of the trading fee consists of a commission paid by LCH.Clearnet to Euronext as a retrocession. These payments were recorded by Euronext as part of its cash trading revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004. In 2003, these payments were recorded as clearing revenues since Clearnet was consolidated in Euronexts accounts until the end of 2003. Euronext has implemented a harmonized fee structure for its cash trading activity, which was most recently updated in February 2005. Under the current fee structure: For trading in equities, there are three different fee packages. The first package involves a flat fee per trade and no minimum activity charge. The other two packages involve a monthly minimum activity charge and a fee per trade calculated on a sliding scale based on volume and the level of the minimum activity charge. An ad valorem fee based on transaction size is also applied to each trade. No order fee is charged so long as the order/trade ratio does not exceed a specified level. For trackers and investment funds, a flat fee is charged for each order placed, and an ad valorem fee based on transaction size is applied to each trade. 112 Table of Contents For warrants and certificates, a flat fee is charged for each order placed, and a flat fee per trade is charged. For bonds, no order fee is charged as long as the order/trade ratio does not exceed a specified level, and a fee per trade is charged according to a sliding scale based on volume. The retrocession for cash trading activity from LCH.Clearnet is based, in the case of Euronext Paris, on a fixed amount per trade from each side of the transaction plus a variable amount that is based on a percentage of the value of the trades cleared. The retrocession for each of Euronext Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon is based on a flat percentage (which varies by exchange) of clearing fees collected by LCH.Clearnet in respect of trades on such exchanges cash market. The fee amounts are determined under the clearing agreement between LCH.Clearnet and Euronexts continental European exchanges, and increased on an annual basis during the 2004 to 2006 period. Revenue from cash trading in any given period depends primarily on the number of trades executed on Euronext and the average price per trade charged for their execution. The level of trading activity is heavily influenced by general market conditions. Other factors may include the number and financial health of companies listed on Euronexts cash markets, and general competitive conditions. Listing fees Listing fees comprise admission fees paid by issuers to list securities on the cash market, annual fees paid by companies whose financial instruments are listed on the cash market, and corporate activity and other fees, consisting primarily of fees charged by Euronext Paris for centralizing shares in initial public offerings and tender offers. Revenues from listing fees primarily relate to shares. Euronext has adopted a common set of listing fees for Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels and Euronext Lisbon. Under the harmonized fee book, domestic issuers ( i.e. , those from France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal) pay admission fees based on market capitalization to list their securities. Subsequent listings of securities receive a 50% discount on admission fees. Non domestic companies are charged admission and annual fees on a similar basis but are subject to lower maximum admission fees and annual fees. Euronext Paris also charges centralization fees for collecting and allocating retail investor orders in initial public offerings and tender offers. Listing fees are recognized upfront except for annual fees, which are recognized ratably throughout the year. The revenue Euronext derives from listing fees is primarily dependent on the number and size of new company listings and tender offers. The number and size of new company listings and tender offers in any period depends primarily on factors outside of Euronexts control, including general economic conditions in Europe and in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal (in particular, stock market conditions) and the success of competing stock exchanges in attracting and retaining listed companies. Derivatives trading Revenue from derivatives trading consists of fixed per contract fees for the execution of trades of derivatives contracts on Euronexts derivatives markets in Paris, London, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. Revenues are driven by the number of trades and fees charged per contract. The principal types of contracts traded are equity and index products and short term interest rate products, which contributed 34% and 62%, respectively, of trading revenues in 2006. Trading in equity products is primarily driven by price volatility on equity markets and indices and trading in short term interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility 113 Table of Contents resulting from uncertainty over the direction of short term interest rates. The level of trading activity is largely outside of Euronexts control. Euronext has recorded retrocession fees from LCH.Clearnet in respect of trades executed on Euronexts continental derivatives markets under derivatives trading revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Retrocession fees for derivatives trading were eliminated at the end of 2006. As of January 1, 2007, Euronext will no longer receive retrocession fees from LCH.Clearnet in respect of trades executed on Euronexts continental derivatives markets. Euronext.liffes fee grid varies by type of contract and by type of member. With respect to the various contracts available through Euronext.liffe, fees are charged as follows: Individual equity options: a flat fee per lot is charged in all Euronext.liffe business centers, except in Amsterdam (where the fees are capped). Individual equity futures: this type of contract is available in Lisbon and London, in respect of which a flat fee is charged per lot. Index products: fees for these products are based on a flat fee per contract, and are capped in Amsterdam above a certain level. BClear: this is one of three services for wholesale equity derivatives that Euronext launched in 2005. Nearly all equity derivative contracts listed in our 5 centers and more than 300 underlyings listed in other non Euronext markets are listed on BClear. The BClear fee structure is based on a per lot fee per side up to a fee cap. Interest rate products: these products are available in London, in respect of which a fee is charged per lot. Commodity products: these products are available in London and Paris, in respect of which a flat fee is charged per lot. Each Euronext.liffe center, except for Lisbon, provides preferred rates to market makers as follows: In London, with respect to single equity options, market makers may be categorized as primary market makers (PMM) or designated market makers (DMM), which are exempt from transaction charges or receive fee discounts on business they transact in a market making capacity. A separate DMM category exists for the FTSE 100 Index options contract (ESX) as well as a specific regime that governs trades in the FTSEurofirst contract. In Amsterdam, market makers pay a liquidity provider fee (0.07 per lot) based on the category, or Euronext Class Combination (ECC), in which a market maker falls. In Paris, market makers pay either 0.03 or 0.04 per lot for orders of up to 6,000 lots, depending on whether they act as a permanent market maker (PMM) or responding market maker (RMM). For orders above 6,000 lots, PMMs or RMMs pay 80 per trade. In Brussels, market makers are eligible for a low fee, equivalent to the liquidity provider fee in Amsterdam on equity options. MTS fixed income In November 2005, Euronext acquired 51.0% of a joint venture entity, MBE Holding, which currently owns 60.37% of the voting shares of MTS. Euronext proportionally consolidated MTS for only one month in 2005, recording proportionally consolidated revenues from MTS of 1.4 million. 114 Table of Contents Revenues from MTS are derived from membership fees, transactions fee and post trading fees for the execution of trades of cash and money market products. MTS implemented a new fee structure in January 2005 with the following principal characteristics: For the trading of cash products on its main markets (MTS Italy, EuroMTS and MTS Deutschland), MTS charges a per trade fee calculated on a sliding scale based on annual volume. Under the new fee structure, membership fees for market makers are waived. For the trading of money market products, MTS charges a per trade fee calculated on a sliding scale based on annual volume. For trading on BondVision, MTS charges a fee per trade calculated on a sliding scale based on annual volume. Post trading fees are calculated on the number of settlement messages. Revenue from MTS in any given period depends primarily on the number of trades executed on its platform and the average price per trade charged for their execution. The level of trading activity is heavily influenced by general market conditions (volatility levels in the bond markets and interest rate levels) and thus outside of Euronexts control. Settlement and custody Revenue from settlement and custody currently consists of fees for settling securities trades and fees for associated custodial services relating to securities traded in Euronexts cash markets in Portugal, which are generated by Interbolsa. During each of the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, these fees also included settlement and custody fees generated by Euronexts cash markets in Brussels, which were generated by CIK (Belgium) which was sold to Euroclear in 2006. Settlement and custody fees vary by market, and are charged on a per trade basis for settlement fees and on a fee based on the market value of the securities in question for custody services. Information services Revenue from information services consists of fees that Euronext charges to a variety of users, primarily the end users, for the use of Euronexts real time market data services. Euronext also collects annual license fees from vendors for the right to distribute Euronext data to third parties and a service fee from vendors for direct connection. A substantial majority of Euronexts data revenues is derived from monthly end user fees. Euronext also derives revenues from selling historical and reference data about securities, and by publishing the daily official lists for the Euronext markets. The principal drivers of information services revenues are the number of end users and the prices for data packages. Sale of software Revenue from sale of software primarily consists of license fees received from securities exchanges and other financial institutions for software that Euronext develops internally or licenses. Throughout the periods under review, this revenue was generated primarily by GL TRADE. In addition, until June 30, 2005, sale of software included fees received by LIFFE Market Solutions for its LIFFE CONNECT&reg; software package. On July 1, 2005, these latter activities were transferred to AEMS. GL TRADEs revenues are earned mainly from annual subscriptions to its software and technology offerings (subscriptions represented approximately 76% of GL TRADEs revenues in 2006). Subscriptions generally have an initial term of two years, and are renewed annually absent notice of cancellation. Most subscription contracts are on a calendar year basis. Subscriptions are generally paid in advance. The group records revenues from subscription agreements on a pro rata basis over the life of the subscription agreements, 115 Table of Contents with the unrealized portions of invoiced subscription fees recorded as deferred revenues. Because of the annual nature of subscription agreements, changes in subscription revenues typically lag developments in the markets that GL TRADE serves. Subscription fees include basic service packages. Customers are invoiced separately for GL TRADEs enhanced service packages. A portion of GL TRADEs revenues, principally for its advanced order management offering, are derived from sales of five year software licenses, which are generally accompanied by annual maintenance and service contracts. The bulk of GL TRADEs revenues from these arrangements are recorded at the time of the license sale, while the maintenance contracts are typically renewed over time and thus generate recurrent revenues. As a result, a major license contract can have a significant impact on GL TRADEs revenues for a given period, which will not necessarily carry forward to the same extent into future periods. Other income The primary recurring items within other income are rental income, administrative services provided to LCH.Clearnet on a transitional basis following its creation and since July 1, 2005, charges to AEMS for the supply of transitional services provided by Euronext. Costs and expenses The following is a summary of Euronexts principal cost and expense categories. Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of employee salaries and bonuses, compulsory social security contributions with respect to employees and pension expenses. Since January 1, 2004, this line item has included stock option expense recorded under IFRS 2. Depreciation Depreciation consists of depreciation of tangible fixed assets and intangible fixed assets (excluding goodwill) as well as write offs on intangible assets. Goodwill amortization Euronext adopted IFRS 3 for all business combinations agreed on or after March 31, 2004. Starting January 1, 2005, Euronext no longer amortizes goodwill relating to acquisitions made before March 31, 2004 as part of a business combination, in line with IFRS 3. From January 1, 2005, goodwill is assessed periodically for impairment. During 2003 and 2004, goodwill amortization primarily consisted of amortization of goodwill related to Euronexts acquisition of LIFFE. The balance of goodwill primarily related to the merger that led to Euronexts creation in September 2000, as well as goodwill relating to Euronexts acquisition of BVLP ( Bolsa de Valores de Lisboa e Porto , now known as Euronext Lisbon). Information technology expenses IT expenses consist primarily of costs relating to fees paid to third party providers of networks and information technology resources, including fees for consulting, research and development services, software rental costs and licenses, hardware rental and related fees paid to third party maintenance providers. Since July 1, 2005, these expenses consist primarily of fees charged by AEMS for IT services relating to the operation and maintenance of Euronexts cash and derivatives trading platforms, including license fees relating to NSC and LIFFE CONNECT&reg;. 116 Table of Contents Office, telecom and consultancy Office, telecom and consultancy costs consist primarily of travel expenses, telecommunications expenses, fees for insurance and information services, third party contracting fees and fees paid to consultants, (other than information technology consultants) attorneys and accountants. Accommodation Accommodation costs and expenses include lease payments for rented office space and related service charges for utilities, security, maintenance and cleaning and related items. Euronext is reimbursed for certain expenses by third parties, including AEMS, under sublease arrangements. Marketing costs Marketing costs consist primarily of advertising and other promotional expenses including costs relating to presentations, events, sponsorships, foreign offices and similar items. Other expenses Other expenses consist of miscellaneous costs, including irrecoverable VAT and other sundry non income taxes, regulatory fees, production costs for information services and other miscellaneous costs. Net financing income Net financing income consists of interest income (primarily interest earned on short term investments, deposits and cash balances with banks), interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses on disposal of investments and gains and losses on revaluation of financial assets and liabilities the changes in fair value of which are booked in the income statement (primarily derivative instruments). Income from associates Income from associates consists of Euronexts share in the results of operations of associated companies (i.e., companies over which Euronext has a significant influence, but over which it does not exercise control). Euronext accounts for these entities under the equity method after taking into consideration the effect of intercompany transactions. Income from associates during the period under review primarily consisted of Euronexts share of the results of LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. and AEMS. Minority interests Minority interests during the period under review related primarily to the approximately 60% interest held by third parties in GL TRADE and, since December 2005, the interest held by minority investors in MTS. 117 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Revenues Euronexts total revenues increased by 14.6% from 961.9 million in 2005 to 1,102.2 million in 2006, driven by a very high level of trading activity on Euronexts cash and derivatives markets. The following table summarizes the composition of Euronexts revenues in 2005 and 2006. Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 %Change 2006/2005 (in thousands of euros) Cash trading Trade execution fees, order fees and connection fees 230,356 174,624 31.9 % Clearing fee retrocession for cash trading 56,543 41,119 37.5 % Subtotal 286,899 215,743 33.0 % Listing fees 55,637 63,130 (11.9 )% Derivatives trading Order fees 390,665 326,125 19.8 % Clearing fee retrocession for continental derivatives trading 906 5,798 (84.4 )% Subtotal 391,571 331,923 18.0 % MTS fixed income 24,019 1,437 NA Settlement and custody 14,553 39,280 (62.9 )% Information services 112,004 93,592 19.7 % Sale of software 184,607 195,212 (5.4 )% Other income 32,901 21,550 52.7 % Total revenues 1,102,191 961,867 14.6 % Cash trading Revenue from cash trading increased by 33.0% to 286.9 million in 2006, due primarily to the continuation and acceleration of the strong recovery in market activity which started in the second half of 2005. 219.5 million cash transactions were executed on Euronexts cash markets in 2006, a 35.1% increase over 2005 corresponding to a daily average of 860,692 trades (itself a 36.2% increase over 2005). As a consequence, trade execution and connection fees increased by 31.9% in 2006 to 230.4 million from 174.6 million in 2005, with the average fee per trade decreasing slightly (from 1.03 to 1.02) due to Euronexts sliding fee scale. The clearing fee retrocession paid by LCH.Clearnet for trades on the Euronext cash markets increased by 38% to 56.5 million in 2006 from 41.1 million in 2005, driven by an increase in trading volume. Listing fees Listing revenues decreased 12% from 63.1 million in 2005 to 55.6 million in 2006. The decrease was notwithstanding a very active primary market in 2006 and resulted from the existence of very large IPOs in 2005 (EDF and GDF in particular). There were 142 new listings on Euronext markets in 2006 as compared to 78 in 2005; due to the larger aggregate size of the new listings in 2005, however, admission and public offer fees decreased by 14.7% to 42.3 million. Of the new listings in 2006, 57 were listed on Alternext, which was rolled out during the year to Brussels and Amsterdam. Annual fees fell by 2% to 13.4 million in 2006, reflecting delistings or mergers during the year. At the end of 2006, 1,210 companies were listed on Euronext, representing a market capitalization of 2,812 billion euros. 118 Table of Contents Derivatives trading Revenue from derivatives trading increased by 18% to 391.6 million in 2006, driven primarily by higher volumes across the main markets and products and, to a lesser degree, by the launch in November 2005 of fully integrated transactional products, Afirm, Cscreen and Bclear. Overall, the increased volumes resulted from market volatility, strong cash markets activity and interest rate uncertainty. Overall volumes increased 21% to 730.3 million contracts traded in 2006, and average daily trading volume rose 21.5% to 2,863,934 contracts. The overall increase in volumes reflected very high volumes in the first half of the year and lower volumes in the second half, due to decreased market volatility. Trading revenues from interest rate products amounted to 235.8 million in 2006, a 21.9% increase over 2005. The increase was due to an 18.7% increase in the number of contracts traded to 412.2 million, itself due to higher volatility induced by on going speculation over interest rate trends (and in particular interest rate decisions of the European and UK central banks), and to a slight increase (from 56 to 57 cents) in the average fee per contract, itself resulting in part from the fact that the Euro dollar contract, which negatively affected results in 2005, was not offered in 2006. Equity derivatives trading revenues increased 19.5% to 122.5 million in 2006, of which 10.9 million related to OTC trading (via Bclear). Excluding Bclear, volumes increased by 3.1% to 255.9 million contracts. Bclear itself generated 51.6 million contracts traded in 2006, accounting for 89% of the overall volume increase in equity derivatives trading revenues. Commodity product trading revenues increased by 14.6% to 12.8 million in 2006, driven by a 15.9% increase in volume to a total of 9.9 million contracts traded. As a consequence of the change in the underlying contract sizes in the French market (which mechanically reduced the number of contracts traded), the clearing fee retrocession paid by LCH.Clearnet for continental derivatives trading decreased by 84.4% to 0.9 million in 2006. MTS Fixed income Euronexts share of MTS revenues amounted to 24 million in 2006. The corresponding revenues in 2005 during which MTS was proportionately consolidated for one month, were 1.4 million. On a comparable basis and for informational purposes only, MTS fixed income revenues increased by 2.4 % from 2005 to 2006. Settlement and custody The 62.9% decrease in settlement and custody revenues between the periods is due to the sale, effective January 1, 2006, of CIK, which had accounted for 24.5 million of revenues in 2005. Settlement and custody revenues in 2006, which amounted to 14.6 million, were generated solely by Interbolsa. These were 2% lower than those generated by Interbolsa in 2005, with higher volumes slightly offsetting lower prices under a new tariff structure implemented at the beginning of 2006. Information services Information services revenues increased 19.7% to 112 million in 2006. The increase resulted partly from revenues generated by newly consolidated companies (3.5 million from MTS and 2.7 million from Company News). The increase on a stand alone basis was 13.4% and was due mainly to a 6.4% increase in the number of both cash and derivatives terminals receiving Euronext data and to the full year positive effect of both a 5% price increase in the cash information services package and the harmonization of the derivatives information services packages implemented, respectively, in April and July 2005. 119 Table of Contents Sale of software The 5.4% decrease in revenue from the sale of software from 195.2 million in 2005 to 184.6 million in 2006 is due to the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS in July 2005; accordingly, 2006 revenues consist solely of GL TRADEs revenues and no longer of revenues from the licensing of LIFFE Connect. GL TRADEs revenues increased by 3% from 2005 to 2006, due in particular to acquisitions and organic growth in Asia, Eastern Europe and the US, mitigated by contract terminations in Europe. Other income Other revenues increased by 52.7% from 21.5 million to 32.9 million from 2005 to 2006. This is explained by the full year effect of services charged to AEMS in London, improved rental income in continental Europe and full year consolidation of MTS other revenues. Costs and expenses Euronexts total costs and expenses rose by 7.7% to 693.2 million in 2006. The following table summarizes the major components of costs and expenses for 2005 and 2006. Year ended December 31, %Change 2006/2005 2006 2005 (in thousands of euros) Salaries and employee benefits 275,385 264,360 4.2 % Depreciation 32,583 49,687 (34.4 )% IT expenses 166,176 139,772 18.9 % Office, telecom and consultancy 130,089 98,785 31.7 % Accommodation 44,358 50,111 (11.5 )% Marketing 20,295 15,586 30.2 % Other expenses 24,297 25,088 (3.2 )% Total costs and expenses 693,183 643,389 7.7 % Changes in scope of consolidation affecting costs The comparability of expenses between 2005 and 2006 is affected by several changes in scope of consolidation between the periods. Creation of Atos Euronext Market Solutions On July 22, 2005, Euronext formed Atos Euronext Market Solutions as a continuation and expansion of its existing AtosEuronext relationship with Atos Origin. The main assets Euronext contributed were the activities of LIFFE Market Solutions, the information technology division of its derivatives trading business Euronext.liffe (including Euronexts proprietary LIFFE CONNECT&reg; electronic trading system), and its 50% stake in AtosEuronext. Atos Origin contributed its own 50% share in AtosEuronext, plus other major assets from market related businesses, including middle and back office solutions, and its 51% stake in the connectivity platform Bourse Connect. The transfer of the activities of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS led to a significant reduction in Euronexts salaries and employee benefit costs, consultancy expenses, other office, telecom and consultancy costs and depreciation charges, and a parallel increase in IT expenses, which now include all IT expenses related to Euronext.liffe. The transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS represented in the aggregate a 9.9 million reduction in costs from 2005 to 2006. 120 Table of Contents Other changes As noted elsewhere, Euronext acquired MTS in November 2005 through a joint venture entity with Borsa Italiana, acquired 100% of Company News in March 2006 and sold CIK effective January 1, 2006. In the aggregate, newly consolidated MTS and Companynews added 20.4 million and 3.0 million in costs, respectively, for 2006, and the sale of CIK reduced costs by 17.4 million in such period. Salaries and employee benefits Staff costs increased by 4% from 264.4 million to 275.4 million in 2006. The increase resulted from the combination of the various changes in scope of consolidation (transfer to AEMS in July 2005, sale of CIK, acquisition of both MTS and Company News) and performance related compensation such as bonuses, which increased in line with the increased operating and net income of the Group, and higher incentive plan costs resulting from a sharp increase in Euronexts share price over the year. Overall workforce increased year on year from 2,302 to 2,324 FTE, due in particular to acquisitions and hiring by GL TRADE. On a constant basis and excluding GL TRADE, headcount decreased 5.2% to 1,169 FTE. Depreciation Depreciation expense amounted to 32.6 million in 2006, a 34% decrease from 49.7 million recorded in 2005. This is due primarily to the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions IT related tangible and intangible assets to AEMS as of July 1, 2005; depreciation expense related to these assets had amounted to 21.3 million in 2005. Excluding the effect of this transfer, depreciation expense increased by 4.2 million from period to period, due to the commencement of depreciation of various new software developments as well as the consolidation of MTS (1.1 million), which offset a 2.1 million decrease due to the sale of CIK. Information technology expenses IT expenses increased by 18.9% to 166.2 million in 2006 from 139.8 million in 2005. This increase resulted primarily from the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions activities to AEMS, which accounted for 35.1 million of additional IT costs. In addition, Euronexts share of IT expenses at MTS amounted to 9.9 million, as compared with 1.2 million in 2005 for December solely. These increases were partly offset by a 5.9 million decrease resulting from the sale of CIK. Excluding the effect of these changes in consolidation, IT costs decreased by 11 million, as the initial synergies following the creation of AEMS were generated. In particular, running costs (excluding GL TRADE) decreased by 6.6 million to 139.4 million and the lower number of actual development days contributed to 3.6 million of the decrease of IT expenses. Office, telecom and consultancy Office, telecom and consultancy expense increased 31.7% to 130.1 million in 2006. This increase resulted primarily from the incurrence of 47.6 million of costs relating to corporate transactions, in particular in connection with the NYSE Euronext transaction. While substantial corporate transaction costs had been incurred in 2005, relating in particular to the proposed transaction with the London Stock Exchange, the 2006 costs were considerably higher. These additional costs more than offset the reductions resulting from the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS and the sale of CIK (5.4 million and 1.5 million, respectively). Accommodation Accommodation costs decreased by 11.5% from 50.1 million to 44.4 million in 2006. This decrease resulted primarily from the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS and the sale of CIK (accounting for differences of 1.7 million and 0.6 million, respectively), a 1.4 million decrease in maintenance expenses and a 1.7 million decrease resulting from lease renegotiation and rationalisation. 121 Table of Contents Marketing Marketing costs increased 30.2% to 20.3 million in 2006, due to brand promotion advertising campaigns and advertising in support of specific initiatives in cash and derivatives activities. Other expenses Other costs decreased 3% to 24.3 million in 2006. This principal reason for the decrease was a 2.9 million reduction in VAT resulting from the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS, as well as a 1.2 million reduction in professional fees, which offset the additional costs induced by the inclusion of MTS and Companynews. Segment Operating Profit The following table provides information concerning segment operating profit on a euro basis and as a percentage of segment revenues for the periods indicated.

Revenues for this segment consist of Other income, as described above. Euronexts operating profit increased as a percentage of revenues from 33.1% in 2005 to 37.1% in 2006 in spite of the substantial one off expenses incurred in relation to corporate transactions as noted above. The substantial increases in the operating profit margins of the cash trading and derivatives trading segments resulted both from buoyant trading conditions and strict cost control, with both segments recording lower expenses. Information services continued its growth while listing declined due to the 2005 base effect (two exceptionally large transactions). Finally, Sale of software margin started to recover this year. 122 Table of Contents Other Items affecting Net Profit The following table summarizes the income statement line items below the line Profit from Operations for 2006 and 2005. Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 %Change 2006/2005 (in thousands of euros) (Restated) Profit from operations 409,008 318,478 28.4 % Net financing income 11,513 11,306 1.8 % Gain (loss) on sale of associates and activities 15,394 9,054 70.0 % Income from associates 53,739 18,456 191.1 % Subtotal 80,646 38,816 107.8 % Profit before tax 489,654 357,294 37.0 % Income tax (116,019 ) (103,931 ) 11.6 % Profit after tax 373,635 253,363 47.5 % Minority interests (11,856 ) (13,409 ) (11.6 )% Net profit attributable to the shareholders of parent company 361,779 239,954 +50.8 % Net financing income Net financing income increased slightly (by 1.8%) to 11.5 million in 2006. The substantial capital repayment paid to shareholders induced a drop of interest margin, which was largely offset by an increase in dividends received from financial investments. Gain (loss) on sale of associates and activities In 2006, Euronext recorded a gain of 15.4 million, relating primarily to the sale of CIK to Euroclear. The 2005 amount consisted of gains of 5.0 million and 4.1 million, respectively, on the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions and Bourse Connect to AEMS in July 2005. Income from associates Income from associates nearly tripled to 53.7 million in 2006. This increase resulted primarily from improved performance by LCH.Clearnet, which contributed 36.9 million of income in 2006. This contribution was made notwithstanding the recognition by LCH.Clearnet in the first half of 2006 of a 47.8 million charge to write off certain IT related assets (relating to its Generic Clearing System initiative), following a 20.1 million write off of assets related to such initiative in the first half of 2005. The contribution of AEMS amounted to 15.4 million, as compared with a total contribution from both Atos Euronext (in the first half of 2005), and AEMS (in the second half of 2005) of 4.9 million, reflecting the larger size of AEMS. Income tax expense Income tax expense increased from 103.4 million in 2005 to 116.0 million in 2006, primarily as a result of increased profit. Partially offsetting the effect of increased profitability was a 11 million adjustment, in light of the change in French tax law adopted in 2004, of Euronexts deferred tax assets relating to the sale of Clearnet to LCH.Clearnet to reflect a reduced capital gain tax rate applicable in 2007 when the related positions can be liquidated. 123 Table of Contents Minority interests Minority interests decreased by 11.6% primarily due to decreased net profits at GL TRADE and despite the presence of additional minority interest following the acquisition of MTS. Net profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company For the reasons discussed above, net profit rose by 50.8% to 361.8 million in 2006. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Revenues Euronexts total revenues increased by 8.5% from 886.8 million in 2004 to 961.9 million in 2005. The following table summarizes the composition of Euronexts revenues for 2004 and 2005. Year endedDecember 31, % Change2005/2004 2005 2004 (in thousandsof euros) Cash trading Trade execution fees, order fees and connection fees 174,624 156,437 11.6 % Clearing fee retrocession for cash trading 41,119 33,300 23.5 % Subtotal 215,743 189,737 13.7 % Listing fees 63,130 43,270 45.9 % Derivatives trading Order fees 326,125 317,549 2.7 % Clearing fee retrocession for continental derivatives trading 5,798 7,369 (21.3 )% Subtotal 331,923 324,918 2.2 % MTS fixed income 1,437 Settlement and custody 39,280 33,122 18.6 % Information services 93,592 87,297 7.2 % Sale of software 195,212 185,965 5.0 % Other income 21,550 22,528 (4.3 )% Total revenues 961,867 886,837 8.5 % Cash trading Revenue from cash trading increased by 13.7% to 215.7 million in 2005, due primarily to a strong recovery in market activity in the second half of 2005 that drove an 11.6% increase in trade execution fees, order fees and connection fees and a 23.5% increase in the related clearing fee retrocession for trades on the cash markets cleared by LCH.Clearnet. A record 155.5 million share transactions were executed on Euronexts cash markets in 2005, up 15.7% over 2004. The total number of trades in all cash products amounted to 162 million during 2005 (an increase of 15.0% over 2004), corresponding to a daily average of 632,000 trades (an increase of 15.8% over 2004). The recovery in market activity was driven primarily by a recovery in the confidence in the profitability of listed companies, as illustrated by rising indices, and a solid market for primary offerings, including some major initial public offerings. NextTrack, Euronexts tracker market segment, recorded a 28.5% increase in the number of transactions and a 38.0% increase in value traded during 2005, due in part to the creation of 40 new products 124 Table of Contents in 2005, which brought the total number of trackers to 95 at year end, as well as to the creation of partnerships with e brokers. The number of transactions (excluding cross trades) on NextWarrants, Euronexts segment for certificates and warrants, grew by 46% compared to 2004. Higher trading volumes were also encouraged by a new fee structure introduced in February 2005 that includes volume discounts designed to promote higher activity. Trade execution fees alone amounted to 163.1 million in 2005, an increase of 11.7% over 2004. The increase in trading volumes described above helped to offset a reduction in the average fee charged per trade (excluding liquidity provider trades), from 1.07 in 2004 to 1.03 in 2005. The clearing fee retrocession paid by LCH.Clearnet in 2005 increased by 23.5% to 41.1 million, compared to 33.3 million in 2004. The increase was driven by an increase in transaction values, as well as by an increase in trading volume. Listing fees Revenue from listing fees increased 45.9% to 63.1 million in 2005. This increase resulted primarily from a significant increase in admission fees, which more than doubled to 47.5 million in 2005. The increase in admission fees was driven by higher initial public offerings activity. 78 initial public offerings were completed during 2005, compared to 52 during 2004, raising 17.2 billion and adding 105 billion in additional market capitalization. Two of these initial public offerings those of EDF S.A. and GDF S.A. were among the largest in Europe in recent years. Of the 78 initial public offerings in 2005, 20 were listed on Alternext, a new exchange regulated market targeted at SMEs launched in May 2005. The increase in admission fees was also favorably affected by strong listing activity for warrants, with approximately 11,000 new warrants and certificates listed in 2005, up 4% compared to 2004. The increase in admission fees was partially offset by a decline in annual fees, which fell by 5% to 13.6 million in 2005, reflecting delistings during the year, principally by companies with listings in multiple markets. At the end of 2005, 1,259 companies were listed on Euronext, compared to 1,333 companies at the end of 2004. 966 of the companies listed at the end of 2005 were companies based in one of Euronexts home markets. Derivatives trading Revenue from derivatives trading increased 2.2% to 331.9 million in 2005, driven primarily by higher trading revenues from short term interest rate products and commodity derivatives, which more than offset a decrease in trading revenues from equity derivatives. In 2005, changes were made to the notional sizes of various contracts in response to customer demand. To enable year on year comparisons of changes in volume, 2004 volume figures below have been treated as if they were new style contracts by dividing their volumes by ten. Overall volumes (excluding call option dividend trading activity) were 7.0% higher in 2005, increasing from 566.1 million contracts in 2004 to 605.9 million in 2005. Volumes were higher in all major product categories: interest rate products increased by 10.8%, equity products by 2.1% and commodity products by 6.0%. Open interest stood at 78 million contracts, up 13% over 2004 (at 69 million contracts after rebasing of the underlying contract sizes in Paris, or 88.4 million without rebasing). Higher levels of open interest which consists of the total number of futures contracts or option contracts that have not yet been exercised, expired or fulfilled by delivery can be the source of revenue growth due to the likely management of these positions. Trading revenues from interest rate products amounted to 193.4 million in 2005, a 10% increase over 2004. Trading volumes in interest rate products ended the year 10.8% higher than in 2004, with more than 347 million 125 Table of Contents contracts traded, driven primarily by an increase in trading in the second half of the year due to higher volatility resulting from expected changes in the European Central Banks interest rate policy following a long period of stability. Equity derivatives trading revenues declined by 7.5% in 2005 to 102.4 million. Equity derivatives trading volume was 2.1% higher for the year, driven primarily by activity in the second half of the year due to higher volatility in the financial markets. The modest increase in overall volume for the year was more than offset by lower average fees, primarily reflecting the impact of fee decreases for single equity options introduced in November 2004. Commodity product revenues increased by 4.0% to 11.1 million in 2005, driven by a 6.0% increase in volume, increased rebates in London and a change in the business mix in Amsterdam. The clearing fee retrocession paid by LCH.Clearnet for continental derivatives trading in 2005 decreased by 21.3% to 5.8 million, primarily as a result of lower trading volumes in the Paris derivatives market and the change in the underlying contract sizes in the French market (which had the mechanical effect of reducing the number of contracts traded). MTS Fixed Income Euronext proportionately consolidated 51.0% of MTS (via MBE Holding) for one month in 2005, following its acquisition in late November, recording proportionately consolidated revenues of 1.4 million. Settlement and custody Revenues from settlement and custody services amounted to 39.3 million in 2005, an increase of 18.6% over 2004, driven primarily by higher indices, a strong performance in 2005 by new products launched by Euronext Brussels in 2004 and certain one off transactions (such as the restructuring of a Portuguese company) on Euronext Lisbon. Information services Revenue from information services increased 7.2% to 93.6 million in 2005, driven primarily by a 5% increase in fees charged for real time cash market data. Revenues were also positively affected by an increase in the number of end users in the financial services industry, the introduction of a harmonized derivatives trading data offering beginning in July 2005 and the launch of Euronexts Index File Service and NextHistory products. Sale of software Revenue from the sale of software increased 5.0% to 195.2 million in 2005, of which 179.3 million, or 91.8%, was generated by GL TRADE. The remaining 15.9 million of software revenues for 2005 were generated by licenses of the LIFFE CONNECT&reg; product by LIFFE Market Solutions prior to the contribution of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS in July 2005. GL TRADE generated revenues of 179.3 million in 2005, an increase of 29.3 million, or 18.8%, over 2004, primarily reflecting the positive impact of the November 2004 acquisition of Ubitrade S.A. and Davidge Inc. The increase in revenues resulted primarily from sales of risk management and back office product lines originally developed by Ubitrade, which generated 32.3 million of revenues in 2005. Of the Ubitrade product revenues, 13.0 million were attributable to the UBIX post trade derivatives product line, 4.4 million were attributable to the TRADIX risk management product line and 14.9 million (including non recurring license fees and a significant proportion of outsourced consulting services) were attributable to the FERMAT product line, a credit risk management tool that meets the requirements of the new Basel II regulatory regime for banking institutions. 126 Table of Contents The positive impact of the Ubitrade acquisition more than offset a decline in GL TRADEs revenues from its traditional front office business lines, which continued to be negatively affected by consolidation in the financial services sector, particularly in France and Italy, as this reduces GL TRADEs accessible client base. Front office revenues were also negatively affected by the decisions of several international financial institutions to shut down or reduce their trading operations in the UK and Italy. Overall, front office revenues declined by 1% to 133.4 million in 2005, a figure that also reflected in part the positive impact of new front office revenues generated by the Davidge acquisition. Although GL TRADE faced difficulties in its traditional European markets, sales of front office products in the Asia Pacific region recorded organic revenue growth of more than 19% in 2005. GL TRADEs expansion into Eastern Europe showed promising signs as well during 2005, recording revenues of nearly 1.5 million in Russia, where it opened an office at the end of 2005. In the United States, revenues increased by 52.0% compared to 2004, reflecting the integration of Ubitrade S.A., Davidge Inc. and OASIS. Other income Other income decreased 4.3% to 21.6 million in 2005, primarily reflecting a decrease in rental revenues following the termination of a sublease to LCH.Clearnet S.A. in Paris, and a 2.9 million decrease in transitional services fees collected from LCH.Clearnet due to its increased self sufficiency. These items were partially offset by 5.9 million in charges to AEMS during the six months beginning July 1, 2005. Costs and expenses Euronexts total costs and expenses decreased 6.3% to 643.4 million in 2005, primarily due to the fact that goodwill was no longer amortized as of January 1, 2005. The following table summarizes costs and expenses for 2004 and 2005. Year ended December 31, % Change2005/2004 2005 2004 (in thousandsof euros) Salaries and employee benefits 264,360 271,996 (2.8 )% Depreciation 49,687 67,386 (26.3 )% Goodwill amortization 39,875 IT expenses 139,772 129,336 8.1 % Office, telecom and consultancy 98,785 84,392 17.1 % Accommodation 50,111 50,990 (1.7 )% Marketing 15,586 15,250 2.2 % Other expenses 25,088 27,434 (8.6 )% Total costs and expenses 643,389 686,659 (6.3 )% Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits decreased 2.8% from 272.0 million in 2004 to 264.4 million in 2005, primarily as a result of a reduction in headcount at Euronexts operations other than MTS and GL TRADE. Euronext had 268 fewer full time employees in its operations other than MTS and GL TRADE at the end of 2005 than at the end of 2004, a reduction of 18.6% that resulted primarily from the transfer of 207 employees from LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS in July 2005. These headcount reductions more than offset the impact of a 17.1% (12.5 million) increase in GL TRADE staff costs, primarily reflecting the impact of a full year of staff costs from Ubitrade and Davidge compared to only one and two months, respectively, in 2004, and an increase of 2.1 million in stock option expense at Euronext and GL TRADE compared to 2004. 127 Table of Contents In late November 2005, Euronext acquired an indirect interest in MTS, which had 98 full time employees at the end of 2005. Depreciation Depreciation expense decreased by 17.7 million, or 26.3%, to 49.7 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions IT related tangible and intangible assets to AEMS as of July 1, 2005, which resulted in savings of 18.0 million. The decrease also reflects the recording in 2004 of a 9.0 million write off at Euronext.liffe following the migration of LIFFE CONNECT&reg;. These decreases were partially offset by the migration of the Euronext Amsterdam derivatives market from SWITCH to LIFFE CONNECT&reg; at the end of 2004 and various other capital expenditures that led to new depreciation charges in 2005. In addition, Euronext recorded 3.4 million in amortization of certain intangible assets in GL TRADE in 2005. Goodwill amortization Euronext adopted IFRS 3 for all business combinations agreed on or after March 31, 2004. Starting January 1, 2005, Euronext no longer amortizes goodwill relating to acquisitions made before March 31, 2004 as part of a business combination in line with IFRS 3. From January 1, 2005, goodwill is assessed periodically for impairment. Accordingly, there was no goodwill amortization expense in 2005. In 2004, goodwill amortization totaled 39.9 million and related primarily to Euronexts acquisition of LIFFE (24.9 million), the merger that led to Euronexts creation in September 2000 (9.1 million), and goodwill relating to Euronexts acquisition of BVLP (4.0 million). Information technology expenses IT expenses increased by 10.4 million, or 8.1%, to 139.8 million in 2005. This increase resulted primarily from the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions activities to AEMS, which accounted for 27.9 million in additional IT costs, and a 3.1 million increase in IT costs at GL TRADE during 2005 as a result of external growth. These increased expenses were partially offset by an aggregate 22.0 million decrease in other IT costs, resulting primarily from the completion of the derivatives market IT migration in Amsterdam in November 2004, which caused IT operating costs in continental Europe to fall by 16.4 million to 64.3 million in 2005, and a lower number of working days billed to Euronext for software development. Office, telecom and consultancy Office, telecom and consultancy expense increased 17.1% from 84.4 million in 2004 to 98.8 million in 2005, due to expenses relating to the envisaged acquisition of the London Stock Exchange (16.6 million) and external growth at GL TRADE (8.7 million). This increase was partially offset by a 6.0 million reduction in consultancy costs relating to the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions to AEMS. Accommodation Accommodation costs decreased 1.7% to 50.1 million in 2005, primarily reflecting the full year impact of the termination of certain leases (one in Paris and six in London) as well as a number of new subletting contracts that helped to decrease costs. This decrease was partially offset by a 14.0% increase in accommodation costs at GL TRADE, stemming from its external growth. Marketing Marketing costs increased 2.2% from 15.3 million in 2004 to 15.6 million in 2005, due primarily to higher advertising and related costs in connection with the geographic expansion of Euronexts derivatives trading markets. 128 Table of Contents Other expenses Other expenses decreased 8.6% to 25.1 million in 2005, primarily reflecting lower expenses for non recoverable VAT and lower regulatory fees, partially offset by an increase in administrative costs and commissions. Segment Operating Profit The following table provides information concerning segment operating profit in thousands of euros and as a percentage of segment revenues for the periods indicated.

Revenues for this segment consist of Other income, as described above. Euronexts operating profit increased as a percentage of revenues from 22.6% in 2004 to 33.1% in 2005. Revenues grew faster than costs and expenses in all segments other than the sale of software, where the decline in margins reflected in part, the impact of integrating Ubitrade and Davidge for the full year in 2005. In addition, as noted above, goodwill is no longer amortized beginning January 1, 2005. Other Items affecting Net Profit The following table summarizes the income statement line items below the line Profit from Operations for 2005 and 2004. Year endedDecember 31, % Change2005/2004 2005 2004 (in thousands of euros) (Restated) (Restated) Profit from operations 318,478 200,178 59.1 % Net financing income 11,306 7,680 47.2 % Gain on sale of associates and activities 9,054 4,386 106.4 % Income from associates 18,456 3,327 454.7 % Subtotal 38,816 15,393 152.2 % Profit before tax 357,294 215,571 65.7 % Income tax (103,931 ) (54,814 ) 89.6 % Profit after tax 253,363 160,757 57.6 % Minority interests (13,409 ) (11,019 ) 21.7 % Net profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company 239,954 149,738 60.2 % 129 Table of Contents Net financing income Net financing income increased 47.2% from 7.7 million in 2004 to 11.3 million in 2005, primarily as a result of a net foreign exchange gain of 1.0 million in 2005 compared to a 4.4 million loss in 2004. Gain on sale of associates and activities Euronext recorded gains of 5.0 million and 4.1 million on the transfer of LIFFE Market Solutions and Bourse Connect, respectively, to AEMS in July 2005. In 2004, Euronext recorded a gain of 4.4 million on the sale of Cote Bleue S.A. Income from associates Income from associates increased from 3.3 million in 2004 to 18.5 million in 2005, which primarily reflected the absence during 2005 of goodwill amortization relating to the acquisition of LCH.Clearnet, since goodwill is no longer amortized under IFRS. In 2004, goodwill amortization relating to the acquisition of LCH.Clearnet amounted to 12.3 million. The increase in income from associates during 2005 was also partially due to an increased contribution from AEMS. AEMS contributed 5.0 million in 2005, compared to the 1.9 million contribution from AtosEuronext in 2004, largely reflecting the larger size of AEMS. This increase was partially offset by a lower contribution from Bourse Connect during 2005 of 0.9 million (compared to 1.5 million in 2004), which was contributed to AEMS in July 2005. Income tax expense Income tax expense increased from 54.8 million in 2004 to 104.0 million in 2005, primarily as a result of increased profit for Euronext. In addition, during 2004 the French government enacted legislation through which the capital gains tax will be reduced in the years up to 2007. As a result, Euronexts deferred tax positions were adjusted in 2004 to reflect the expected tax rates when the related positions could be liquidated. This resulted in a 27.3 million reduction in income tax expense for 2004. Minority interests Minority interests increased by 21.7% primarily due to increased net profits of GL TRADE. Net profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company For the reasons discussed above, net profit after goodwill amortization, tax and minority interests, increased 60.2% from 149.7 million in 2004 to 239.9 million in 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Euronexts primary uses of funds are for capital expenditures, working capital, dividend payments, share repurchases under its share repurchase program and repayment or refinancing of debt. Euronext has historically met these requirements through a combination of cash generated by operating activities and short and long term debt. Euronext believes these sources of funds will continue to be adequate to meet its currently anticipated funds requirements. In addition, in order to expand its business, Euronext may make other strategic acquisitions or enter into business combinations, joint ventures or other strategic partnership arrangements with other companies (including other securities exchanges). Any such transaction (particularly an acquisition or similar business combination) may involve the payment of consideration in the form of cash, shares or other securities, or a combination of both. Euronext has had, and expects to continue to have, discussions with numerous third parties regarding potential strategic alliances. As of the date hereof, Euronext has not entered into any definitive agreement for an acquisition or other business combination, other than as described herein. 130 Table of Contents Sources of Funds Euronexts principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand, short term financial investments and cash flow from operating activities. At December 31, 2006, Euronext had cash and cash equivalents of 416.3 million and short term financial investments of 168.2 million; these amounts were respectively 429.5 million and 265.1 million at December 31, 2005. As at December 31, 2006, the Groups net assets classified as held for sale amounted to 456.6 million (506.3 million in assets and 49.7 million in liabilities), relating almost entirely to ordinary shares and redeemable, convertible preference shares in LCH.Clearnet that are expected to be repurchased or redeemed by LCH.Clearnet under an agreement with the company. At December 31, 2005, the Groups net asset classified as held for amounted to 10.6 million. Euronext generated positive cash flows from operating activities of 315.5 million in 2006 compared to 259.5 million in 2005. Euronext believes that it is well positioned to access the bank lending and capital markets in the event it would require additional financing. Standard & Poors and Moodys have assigned ratings of AA and Aa3, respectively, to Euronext. In 2004, Euronext issued &pound;250 million 5.125% fixed rate bonds that mature on June 16, 2009. This issuance refinanced the syndicated bank loan that Euronext had contracted in 2001 to finance its acquisition of LIFFE. In 2006, Euronext obtained a 5 year multi currency 300 million revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, of which 86.4 million was drawn down at December 31, 2006. In addition, GL TRADE has contracted bank facilities for an outstanding amount of 16 million at December 31, 2006 (9 million maturing in June 2009 and 7 million maturing in August 2011). Uses of Funds Capital Expenditures Euronexts capital expenditures (which primarily related to software and equipment) decreased from 41.3 million in 2005 (which included several large projects) to 35.6 million in 2006. Investments either in progress or with respect to which Euronext has made firm commitments to incur in 2007 amount to approximately 16 million. Acquisitions In 2006, Euronext acquired additional shares of MTS for 12.6 million in cash, CompanyNews Group S.A. for 5.5 million in cash, and Hugin for 18.9 million in cash. In addition, GL TRADE acquired NYFIX overseas for 7.1 million in cash and Emos Systems for 4.8 million in cash. All acquisitions were funded using operating cash flows. Dividends and Share Repurchase Programs Euronexts has paid dividends in each year since its formation in 2000. In 2006, Euronext paid dividends of 111.4 million and implemented a share capital repayment of 333.8 million. Working Capital Euronexts working capital requirements decreased by 16.7 million in 2006. At the end of 2006, Euronext had a working capital surplus of 100.3 million, equal to 1.1 months of revenues compared to 1.7 months in 2005. Debt and Minority Put Options Euronexts financing policy is aimed at financing the growth of its business and ensuring that it is financially flexible while maintaining a strong balance sheet. The indebtedness mainly consists of (i) the June 2009 &pound;250.0 million Bonds issued in 2004 to refinance the acquisition of LIFFE, (ii) a 300 million revolving 131 Table of Contents bank loan of which 86.4 million was drawn at the end of 2006, and (iii) outstanding 16 million bank loans contracted by GL TRADE. None of these loans contain any financial covenants or other provisions that could lead to early redemption, other than customary events of default and change of control provisions. The 300 million revolving credit facility permits a change of control of Euronext in certain circumstances. The credit agreement also contemplates that following such a change of control, Euronext may undertake certain steps by way of reorganization which will result in an affiliate of Euronext acceding to the credit agreement in place of Euronext. Such accession is subject to the prior consent of the majority lenders, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed if specified conditions are satisfied. A permitted change of control or reorganization will only trigger a mandatory prepayment if, after the change of control or reorganization, the long term credit ratings assigned to Euronext by Standard & Poors and Moodys are, respectively, below A and below A3 or neither Standard & Poors nor Moodys assigns a long term credit rating to Euronext. In addition, Euronext has granted Borsa Italiana a put option on its 49.0% stake in MBE Holding. The option is exercisable at any time until 2010. As Euronext and Borsa Italiana jointly control MBE Holding, the put option is treated as a derivative financial instrument. The fair value of this option is determined as the difference between the estimated exercise price and 49.0% of the enterprise value determined on the basis of a discounted cash flow method. When the exercise price exceeds the enterprise value, a liability is recognized. At December 31, 2006, the estimated exercise price did not exceed the enterprise value, so no liability was recognized. Euronext has also granted a put option to GL TRADE founders on up to 10.5% of GL TRADEs share capital. The option can be exercised at any moment between February 28, 2006 and June 10, 2024. The exercise price has been set at the average market value of the previous 40 trading days, less 1 euro. The present value of the exercise price of the option (35.2 million on December 31, 2006) is reflected as a current financial liability. GL TRADE has granted put options to minority shareholders of the companies Glesia, which GL TRADE controls. The present value of the exercise price of the options (5.7 million and 0.9 million respectively) is reflected on the balance sheet as a financial liability under IFRS. Contractual Obligations Euronext has various contractual obligations arising from its operations. These obligations are more fully described in this document under various headings under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition of Euronext as well as in the notes to Euronexts consolidated financial statements. The following table lists the aggregate maturities of Euronexts long term debt and operating leases at December 31, 2006: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 years 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years After 5 years In thousands of euros Long Term Debt Obligations (before interest) 475,097 97,782 377,315 Operating Lease Obligations 22,804 11,485 1,472 227 9,620 Total 497,901 109,267 378,787 227 9,620 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In July 2005, GL TRADE acquired OASIS for $4 million. The acquisition price may be increased by up to $3 million until June 30, 2007, depending on the income growth recorded by this company. In August 2006, GL TRADE acquired Nyfix overseas for $9 million. The acquisition price may be increased by up to $6 million, depending on the companys revenues during the period from the acquisition to December 31, 2007. 132 Table of Contents In June 2006, Euronext, together with Atos Origin, granted an ordinary course unlimited parent guarantee to Atos Euronext Market Solutions in respect of payments related to a building lease in the UK. Euronext estimates its total exposure under this guarantee at &pound;11.5 million. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing its financial statements, Euronext makes estimates concerning a variety of matters. Some of these matters are highly uncertain, and Euronexts estimates involve judgments it makes based on the information available to it. The following discussion highlights Euronexts critical accounting policies and estimates. Euronext considers an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it involves significant judgments and estimates on the part of Euronexts management and changes to those judgments or estimates could have a material impact on Euronexts financial presentation. The discussion below addresses only those estimates that Euronext considers most important based on the degree of uncertainty and the likelihood of a material impact if a different estimate were used. There are other areas in which Euronext uses estimates about uncertain matters, but for which the reasonably likely effect of changed or different estimates is not material to Euronexts financial presentation. For a summary of all of Euronexts significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to Euronexts consolidated financial statements. Pension plan assumptions Euronext recognizes its net obligation in respect of its defined benefit pension plans on the basis of an actuarial estimate of the future benefit that employees have earned as of the balance sheet date, net of the valuation of assets to meet these obligations. Euronext prepares this estimate on an annual basis taking into account different actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions used are the discount rate (equal to the yield at the balance sheet date on high quality fixed income instruments) on future benefits and the expected return on plan assets. Euronext evaluates these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan specific and country specific basis. Other assumptions relate to demographic factors, such as retirement age, life expectancy and staff turnover, which are periodically evaluated and updated to reflect Euronexts past experience and future expectations. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, Euronexts pension benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. Impairment testing Rather than being amortized, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually under IFRS, or more frequently when there is an indication of an impairment loss. Goodwill is tested at the level of cash generating units, which correspond to Euronext businesses that generate independent cash flows. The impairment test is based on the relationship between the carrying amount of an asset and its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its sale price or value in use. Value in use is in turn based on the discounted future cash flows method. The determination of the underlying assumptions related to the recoverability of intangible assets is subjective, and therefore requires the exercise of considerable judgment by Euronext. Although Euronext performs sensitivity analyses on its main assumptions in order to strengthen the reliability of its impairment tests, changes in key assumptions about Euronexts business and prospects, or changes in market conditions, could result in future impairment charges. Valuation of Available for Sale securities Investments in Available for Sale securities are carried at fair value. The determination of such fair values is performed either by reference to quoted market prices when these are available or by using a valuation technique. Valuation techniques may encompass elements of discounted cash flow analysis, and therefore require the exercise of judgment by Euronext. Although Euronext performs sensitivity analyses on its main assumptions in order to strengthen the reliability of its calculations, changes in key assumptions could result in different fair values. 133 Table of Contents Share based compensation In accordance with IFRS 2, the grant of stock options to employees for services rendered represents a supplementary benefit provided by Euronext. Under IFRS 2, Euronext estimates the fair value of these stock options at the grant date and records the value within shareholders equity. Fair value is determined using a Black and Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the specific features of the stock option plan (net price, period of exercise, etc.), market data at the grant date (such as price, volatility, etc.) and behavioral assumptions relating to option holders. Different assumptions could result in material changes to the expense amounts recorded for these options. Contingent liabilities Euronext is involved in legal and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. Euronext accrues a liability in its financial statements when an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such matters, it is often difficult to predict the final outcome. The cases and claims against Euronext often raise difficult and complex issues. In determining whether a loss should be accrued Euronext evaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Assessing these matters inherently involves the exercise of significant management judgment. Changes in these factors or outcomes that are different from those Euronext expects to occur could materially impact Euronexts financial position or its results of operations. Summary of Differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP Euronext prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, which differ in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP. The principal differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP as they relate to Euronext are discussed in Note 3.12 to Euronexts consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. These notes include a reconciliation of net income and shareholders equity under IFRS to net income and shareholders equity under U.S. GAAP. The most significant items in reconciling Euronexts net income and shareholders equity under IFRS and U.S. GAAP related to impairment and amortization of goodwill and intangible assets, recognition of admission fees and sale of software revenues, accounting for derivatives and hedging instruments, deferred tax relate to business combinations and employee benefits and stock based compensation. Further information on such differences and adjustments is set forth in the notes to Euronexts consolidated financial statements mentioned above. Net income under U.S. GAAP amounted to 329.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, up from 221.1 million in 2005. This corresponds to a 49% increase in net income under U.S. GAAP, compared to the 47% increase in net income under IFRS. The increase in US GAAP adjustments between 2005 and 2006 is mainly due to the adoption since January 1, 2006 of SFAS 123 R Share Based Payment using the prospective method. This led to the reclassification of Euronext stock option awards granted in 2004, which were previously classified as an equity instrument under APB 25, as a liability due to conditions in the awards that are not included in the service, performance or market conditions as described in FAS 123(R). This is the source of the increase in adjustments relating to share based payments from (5,704) million in 2005 to (25,507) in 2006. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK NYSE GROUP Market risk represents the risks of changes in the fair value of financial instruments, derivative or non derivative, caused by fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices. Our primary market risk is associated with fluctuations in interest rates and the effects that such fluctuations may have on our investment portfolio. As 134 Table of Contents of December 31, 2006, investments consist of fixed income instruments with an average duration of 0.9 years and mutual funds. The portfolio investment objective is to invest in securities to preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. These investment securities are subject to interest rate risk and their fair values may fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Management does not believe that a 100 basis point fluctuation in market interest rates would have a material effect on income or cash flows from, or the carrying value of, the investment portfolios as of December 31, 2006. NYSE Group does not believe that it has material exposure to interest rate or foreign currency risks as of December 31, 2006. As part of the credit facility arrangement with the contemplated merger with Euronext, the commercial paper will be issued in the most cost effective currency. The commercial paper will be monitored for interest and foreign currency risks. Furthermore, NYSE Group has not entered into any derivative contracts to mitigate market, interest rate or foreign currency risks as of December 31, 2006. Euronext General As a result of its operating and financing activities, Euronext is exposed to market risks such as changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, as well as equity market risks. Euronext has implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures within the group, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies (Risk Committee, Managing Board or Audit Committee, as appropriate). Euronexts treasury and financing department is charged with identifying risk exposures and monitoring and managing such risks on a daily basis. Euronexts subsidiaries centralize their cash investments, report their risks and hedge their exposures with the groups central treasury and financing department as necessary in accordance with local law. Euronext uses derivative instruments solely to hedge financial risks related to its financial positions or risks that are otherwise incurred in the normal course of its commercial activities. It does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Euronexts principal derivative instrument at December 31, 2006 was a fixed to floating rate swap entered into to hedge its fixed rate bonds issued in 2004. The following table summarizes the composition of Euronexts financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2006.

Interest Rate Risk Substantially all of Euronexts financial assets and liabilities are based on floating rates or on fixed rates that have been swapped to floating rates via fixed to floating rate swaps. As part of its hedging activities, Euronext enters into over the counter interest rate derivative instruments, such as swaps, with counterparties that meet minimum creditworthiness and rating standards. As reflected in the table above, Euronext has entered into a fixed to floating rate swap to hedge a &pound;250 million fixed rate bond issuance denominated in sterling. Because Euronext is a net lender at floating rate in euros, when interest rates on euro denominated instruments decrease, Euronexts financing income is negatively impacted. Assuming constant levels of euro denominated net financial assets at floating rate or at fixed rate with a maturity of less than one year, Euronexts annual financing income would decrease by 2.2 million for each 1% decrease in euro interest rates based on positions at December 31, 2006 (3.8 million for each 1% decrease in euro interest rates based on positions at December 31, 2005). Similarly, because Euronext is a net borrower at floating rate in sterling, when interest rates on sterling denominated instruments increase, Euronexts financing expenses increase. Assuming constant levels of sterling denominated net financial liabilities at floating rate or at fixed rate with a maturity of less than one year, Euronexts annual financing expense would increase by 1.8 million for each 1% increase in sterling interest rates based on positions at December 31, 2006 (0.9 million for each 1% increase in sterling interest rates based on positions at December 31, 2005). Currency risk As a result of Euronexts acquisition of LIFFE, a significant part of Euronexts assets, liabilities, income and expenses of Euronext is recorded in pound sterling, exposing Euronext to a currency risk. When the euro increases in value against the pound sterling, for example, revenues denominated in pound sterling generate a reduced contribution to Euronexts consolidated revenues when translated into euros. Similarly, when the euro decreases in value against the pound sterling, the impact of expenses denominated in pounds sterling is greater when translated into euros. In 2006, 32.4% of Euronexts revenues and 28.4% of its expenses were denominated in pounds sterling. At December 31, 2006, the Groups net currency position was &pound;264 million, consisting of &pound;565 million in assets (including &pound;291 million goodwill) and &pound;301 million in liabilities. The borrowings in pounds sterling, for an amount of &pound;264 million, constitute a partial hedge of the net assets in pounds sterling. The currency exchange rate differences had a positive impact of 7.6 million on the Groups consolidated equity in 2006. At December 31, 2006, based on the &pound;264 million net currency position of the group, a hypothetical 10% increase in the euro/sterling exchange rate would have had a negative 35.7 million impact on shareholders equity. 136 Table of Contents At December 31, 2005, Euronexts net currency position was &pound;284 million, consisting of &pound;579 million in assets (including &pound;291 million of goodwill and &pound;192 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term financial investments) and &pound;295 million in liabilities. The borrowings in pounds sterling, for an amount of &pound;254 million, constitute a partial hedge of the net assets in pounds sterling. Currency exchange rate differences had a positive impact of 12.5 million on the groups consolidated equity in 2005. At December 31, 2005, based on the &pound;284 million net currency position of the group, a hypothetical 10% increase in the euro/sterling exchange rate would have had a negative 37.7 million impact on shareholders equity. Equity market risk Euronext is exposed to equity market risk through its investment in shares of Atos Origin S.A., which were valued at 14.6 million as of December 31, 2006 (18.1 million as of December 31, 2005). A decrease in the value of Atos Origin shares could lead to a financial loss for Euronext. This position is monitored and reported to senior management on a daily basis. At December 31, 2006, all else being equal, a hypothetical 10% decline in the market price of the shares of Atos Origin would have had a 1.5 million impact on the fair value of Euronexts investment in Atos Origin (1.8 million based on the position at December 31, 2005). Until the end of 2005, variations in the fair value of these shares were recorded in financing income (revaluation of asset at fair value through profit and loss) under IFRS and in equity (other comprehensive income) under U.S. GAAP. Following an amendment to IAS 39 that took effect on January 1, 2006 which limits the possibility of designating a financial asset or liability as one at fair value through profit and loss upon initial recognition, Euronexts equity investment in Atos Origin has been reclassified as an available for sale asset. Accordingly, variations in the fair value of these shares are now recognized in equity for both IFRS and U.S. GAAP. 137 Table of Contents
