MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements. Actual results may differ from such forward looking statements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. Certain prior period amounts presented in the discussion and analysis have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Overview NYSE Euronext was formed from the combination of the businesses of NYSE Group and Euronext, which was consummated on April 4, 2007. Prior to that date, NYSE Euronext had no significant assets and did not conduct any material activities other than those incidental to its formation. Following consummation of the combination, NYSE Euronext became the parent company of NYSE Group and Euronext and each of their respective subsidiaries. Under the purchase method of accounting, NYSE Group was treated as the accounting and legal acquiror in the combination with Euronext. On October 1, 2008, NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of The Amex Membership Corporation, including its subsidiary the American Stock Exchange, which is now known as NYSE Amex. NYSE Euronext evaluates segment performance primarily based on operating income. Following the combination of the businesses of NYSE Group and Euronext, NYSE Euronext operates under two reportable segments: U.S. Operations and European Operations. U.S. Operations consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts U.S. markets: obtaining new listings and servicing existing listings, providing access to trade execution in cash equities and options, selling market data and related information and distributing market information to data subscribers, issuing trading permits, providing data processing operations, providing regulatory services, and providing trading technology, software and connectivity to end users. European Operations consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts European markets: providing access to trade execution in all cash products as well as a wide range of derivatives products, providing listing services, selling market data and related information, providing transaction settlement and for the safe custody of physical securities, and providing electronic trading solutions as well as software and connectivity to end users. In January 2009, we created NYSE Technologies (NYXT) to combine the businesses formerly known as NYSE Euronext Advanced Trading Solutions (including NYSE TransactTools, Wombat, and AEMS) and our global market data businesses. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this organizational change on our segment reporting structure going forward. 55 Table of Contents Factors Affecting Our Results The business environment in which NYSE Euronext operates directly affects its results of operations. Our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors, including the level of trading activity in our markets, which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions, competition and market share, broad trends in the brokerage and finance industry, price levels and price volatility, the number and financial health of companies listed on NYSE Euronexts cash markets, changing technology in the financial services industry, and legislative and regulatory changes, among other factors. In particular, in recent years, the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings, the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors, market participants demand for speed, capacity and reliability, which requires continuing investment in technology, and increasing competition for market data revenues. For example, while total trading volumes have been increasing, the growth of our trading and market data revenues could be adversely impacted if we are unsuccessful in attracting additional volumes. The maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing. During 2008, there was turmoil in the economy and upheaval in the credit markets. Equity market indices declined throughout the year, with particularly sharp declines and higher volatility in September and October. Lower levels of economic activity and uncertainty regarding the capital markets can result in a decline in trading volume and deterioration of the economic welfare of our listed companies, which can adversely affect our revenues and future growth. Declines in volumes can also impact our market share and pricing structures. As a result of these economic and market changes, certain of our assets have been impaired. See Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Assets. These disruptions and developments have resulted in a range of actions by the U.S. and foreign governments to attempt to bring liquidity and order to the financial markets and to prevent a prolonged recession in the world economy. Securities and banking regulators have also been active in establishing temporary rules and regulations to respond to this crisis. Some of these actions have resulted in temporary or, in some cases, permanent, restrictions on certain types of securities transactions, most notably short sales of equity securities of certain financial institutions. We cannot predict whether these government efforts will be successful. Dislocation in the credit markets has led to increased liquidity risk. While we have not experienced reductions in our borrowing capacity, lenders in general have taken actions that indicate their concerns regarding liquidity in the marketplace. These actions have included reduced advance rates for certain security types, more stringent requirements for collateral eligibility and higher interest rates. Should lenders continue to take additional similar actions, the cost of conducting our business may increase and our ability to implement our business initiatives could be limited. We expect that all of these factors may have an impact on our businesses. Any potential growth in the global cash markets in the upcoming months will likely be tempered by investor uncertainty resulting from volatility in the cost of energy and commodities, unemployment and recession concerns, as well as the general state of the world economy. Recent Acquisitions AEMS On August 5, 2008, NYSE Euronext completed the acquisition of the 50% stake in AEMS previously owned by Atos Origin. Through the transaction, NYSE Euronext acquired (i) the NSC cash trading and LIFFE CONNECT derivatives trading platform technology, and all of the management and development services surrounding these platforms, (ii) AEMSs third party exchange technology business, and (iii) TRS/CPS, clearing software. The purchase price in the transaction was approximately 162 million ($255 million), net of approximately 120 million ($189 million) of cash acquired, and is subject to certain post closing adjustments. The results of operations and financial condition of AEMS have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the August 5, 2008 acquisition. Going forward, we have branded our technology business, including AEMS, as NYSE Technologies or NYXT. See Item 1 Business Technology. 56 Table of Contents NYSE Amex On October 1, 2008, NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of The Amex Membership Corporation. NYSE Euronext acquired the business of The Amex Membership Corporation, including its subsidiary the American Stock Exchange (now known as NYSE Amex). In the transaction, each holder of a regular membership of The Amex Membership Corporation became entitled to receive approximately 8,100 shares of NYSE Euronext common stock and each holder of an options principal membership became entitled to receive approximately 7,200 shares of NYSE Euronext common stock. A total of approximately 6.8 million shares of NYSE Euronext common stock were issued with a value of approximately $260 million. In addition, each former holder of a regular or options principal membership will be entitled to receive additional consideration calculated by reference to the net proceeds, if any, from the sale of the NYSE Amex headquarters in lower Manhattan, if such sale occurs within a specified period of time and certain conditions are satisfied. Other Transactions In 2008, we completed the statutory buy out of the remaining Euronext shareholders who held approximately 2.3% of the shares of Euronext N.V. and also completed the acquisition of Wombat, a privately held global leader in high performance financial market data management solutions. In addition, NYSE Liffe US, the new U.S. futures exchange of NYSE Euronext, received DCM status in August 2008 and began trading full and e mini gold and silver futures and options on futures contracts in September 2008. Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Assets Testing Methodology and Valuation Considerations Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable assets of a business acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142), we test goodwill of our reporting units (which is generally one level below our two reportable segments) and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. We perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter. The impairment test of goodwill is performed in two steps. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In determining the fair value of its reporting units in step one of the goodwill impairment test, we compute the present value of discounted cash flows and terminal value projected for the reporting unit. The rate used to discount cash flows represents the weighted average cost of capital that we believe is reflective of the relevant risk associated with the projected cash flows. To validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of the reporting units determined in step one of the goodwill impairment test to the market capitalization of NYSE Euronext to derive the implied control premium. In performing this reconciliation, we may, depending on the volatility of our stock price, use either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, generally 30 days. We compare the implied control premium to premiums paid in observable recent transactions of comparable companies to determine if the fair value of the reporting units estimated in step one of the goodwill impairment test is reasonable. 57 Table of Contents In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets (SFAS No. 144), impairment exists when the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from it. An intangible asset subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of the intangible asset, indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as, but not limited to, the reporting unit at which goodwill should be measured for impairment, future operating performance and cash flows, cost of capital, terminal values, control premiums, remaining economic lives of assets, and the allocation of shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, in order to determine whether a decline in the value of certain securities and other investments is other than temporary, and among other factors, we evaluate the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost. In particular, we consider the impact of duration and severity on the period of time expected for recovery to occur. If we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary, we write down the carrying value of the related asset to its estimated fair value. Results of Impairment Tests Based upon tests performed during the fourth quarter of 2008, NYSE Euronext recorded the following impairment charges (in millions): Goodwill $ 1,003 (1) Other intangible assets, net 522 (2) Other 65 (3) Total impairment charges $ 1,590 (1) For the goodwill allocated to our European Cash reporting unit. (2) For the national securities exchange registration of our European Cash reporting unit. (3) Includes impairment losses recorded in connection with our investment in BM&F Bovespa ($57 million) and other investments ($8 million). The impairment charges reflect current economic conditions, adverse equity market conditions which have caused a material decline in industry market multiples, and lower estimated future cash flows of our European Cash reporting unit as a result of increased competition which has caused a decline in our market share of cash trading in Europe as well as pricing pressures following the November 2007 introduction of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). Sources of Revenues Activity Assessment Our U.S. securities exchanges pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. These Section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. NYSE Group, in turn, collects activity assessment fees from member organizations executing trades on our U.S. securities exchanges, and recognizes these amounts when invoiced. 58 Table of Contents Fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and Section 31 fees do not have an impact on NYSE Euronexts net income. Cash Trading In our U.S. Operations, NYSE charges transaction fees for executing trades in NYSE listed equities on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, and NYSE Amex, as well as on orders that are routed to other market centers for execution. Changes to the pricing structure throughout 2007 and 2008 allowed further alignment of transaction revenue with executed volume. In our European Operations, Euronext generates cash trading revenue from fees charged primarily for the execution of trades of equity and debt securities and other cash instruments on Euronexts cash market, which is comprised of the separate cash markets operated in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris. Revenue from cash trading in any given period depends primarily on the number of shares traded on our U.S. securities exchanges, the number of trades executed on Euronext, and the fees charged for execution. The level of trading activity in any period is significantly influenced by a number of factors. See Factors Affecting Our Results. NYSE Euronexts cash trading pricing structures continue to be examined closely as part of a broad strategic review of NYSE Euronexts opportunities for revenue growth and efficiency improvement. As a result, we have and may continue to periodically modify our trading pricing structures. NYSE Euronext seeks to better capture value for the services it renders by aligning more closely transaction revenue with executed volume, product expansion and new product development. For example, effective October 1, 2008, we began offering a global pricing rebate to our European customers who exceed certain volume thresholds on each of our Euronext, NYSE and NYSE Arca trading platforms. Transaction fees that NYSE Euronext earns in the future could also continue to depend on the effect of certain regulations and rule changes, such as MiFID, which have the potential to impact the competitive environment in which NYSE Euronext operates. Derivatives Trading Revenue from derivatives trading consists of fixed per contract fees for executing trades of derivatives contracts on NYSE Liffe and executing options contracts traded on NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. In some cases, these fees are subject to caps. Revenues for fixed per contract fees are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract. The principal types of derivative contracts traded are equity and index products and short term interest rate products. Trading in equity products is primarily driven by price volatility in equity markets and indices and trading in short term interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from uncertainty over the direction of short term interest rates. The level of trading activity for all products is also influenced by market conditions and other factors. See Factors Affecting Our Results. Listings There are two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our U.S. and European securities exchanges listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate related actions. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are not applicable to companies that transfer to one of our U.S. securities exchanges from another listing venue. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be 59 Table of Contents listed, such as stock splits, rights issues, sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee. Annual fees in the U.S. are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of the listed company at the end of the prior year. Non U.S. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the United States. Annual fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original fees are recognized as income on a straight line basis over estimated service periods of ten years for the NYSE and the Euronext cash equities markets and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Listing fees for the Euronext subsidiaries comprise admission fees paid by issuers to list securities on the cash market, annual fees paid by companies whose financial instruments are listed on the cash market, and corporate activity and other fees, consisting primarily of fees charged by Euronext Paris for centralizing shares in IPOs and tender offers. Revenues from listing fees relate primarily to the number of shares outstanding. In general, Euronext has adopted a common set of listing fees for Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels and Euronext Lisbon. Under the harmonized fee book, domestic issuers (i.e., those from France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal) pay admission fees to list their securities based on the market capitalization of the respective issuer. Subsequent listings of securities receive a 50% discount on admission fees. Non domestic companies are charged admission and annual fees on a similar basis, although they are charged lower maximum admission fees and annual fees. Euronext Paris and Euronext Lisbon also charge centralization fees for collecting and allocating retail investor orders in IPOs and tender offers. The revenue NYSE Euronext derives from listing fees is primarily dependent on the number and size of new company listings and tender offers. The number and size of new company listings and tender offers in any period depend primarily on factors outside of NYSE Euronexts control, including general economic conditions in Europe and the United States (in particular, stock market conditions) and the success of competing stock exchanges in attracting and retaining listed companies. Market Data In our U.S. Operations we collect market data fees principally for consortium based data products, also known as core data products, and, to a lesser extent, for NYSE proprietary data products, also known as non core data products. Consortium based data fees are dictated as part of the securities industry plans. Consortium based data revenues from the dissemination of market data (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of a formula set by the SEC under Regulation NMS. Last sale prices and quotes in NYSE listed securities are disseminated through Tape A, which constitutes the majority of the NYSEs revenues from consortium based market data revenues. We also receive a share of the revenues from Tape B and Tape C, which represents data related to trading of certain securities that are listed on NYSE Arca, NYSE Amex, other regional exchanges and Nasdaq, respectively. These revenues are influenced by demand for the data by professional and nonprofessional subscribers. In addition, we receive fees for the display of data on television and for vendor access. Our proprietary products make market data available to subscribers covering activity that takes place solely on our U.S. markets, independent of activity on other markets. Our proprietary data products also include the sale of depth of book information, historical price information and corporate action information. The SEC approved a pilot program through March 31, 2009 for a new data product, NYSE Euronext Real Time Reference Prices, which allows Internet and media organizations to buy real time, last sale market data from NYSE and provide it broadly and free of charge to the public. CNBC, Google Finance and nyse.com are now displaying NYSE Real Time stock prices on their respective websites. In our European Operations we charge a variety of users, primarily the end users, for the use of real time market data services. We also collect annual license fees from vendors for the right to distribute market data to third parties and a service fee from vendors for direct connection to market data. A substantial majority of our 60 Table of Contents European market data revenues is derived from monthly end user fees. We also derive revenues from selling historical and reference data about securities, and by publishing the daily official lists for the Euronext markets. The principal drivers of market data revenues are the number of end users and the prices for data packages. Other Revenues Other revenues include software and technology services and regulatory revenues, as well as trading license fees and other fees, fees for facilities and other services provided to specialists, brokers and clerks physically located on the floors of our U.S. markets that enable them to engage in the purchase and sale of securities on the trading floor, and fees for clearance and settlement activities in our European Operations. Software and Technology Services. We generate revenues from connectivity services related to the SFTI network, software license and maintenance fees, and strategic consulting services. Customers pay to gain access to SFTI market centers via direct circuit to a SFTI access point or through a third party service bureau or extranet provider. SFTI revenue typically includes a connection fee and monthly recurring revenue based on a customers connection bandwidth. Hardware co location services are also offered at SFTI data centers, and customers typically sign multi year contracts. Co location revenue is recognized monthly over the life of the contract. Revenue is also earned from sales of our enterprise software platform, which provides low latency messaging and trade lifecycle management. Software license revenue is recorded at the time of sale, and maintenance contracts are recognized monthly over the life of the maintenance term. Unrealized portions of invoiced maintenance fees are recorded as deferred revenue. Expert consulting services are offered for customization or installation of the software and for general advisory services. Consulting revenue is generally billed in arrears on a time and materials basis, although customers sometimes prepay for blocks of consulting services in bulk. Prepaid consulting revenue is booked as deferred revenue until the services are rendered. We also generate revenues from software license contracts and maintenance agreements. We provide software which allows customers to receive comprehensive market agnostic connectivity, transaction and data management solutions. Software license revenues are recognized at the time of client acceptance and maintenance agreements revenues are recognized monthly over the life of the maintenance term subsequent to acceptance. Regulatory. Regulatory fees are charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges. Components of Expenses Section 31 Fees See Sources of Revenues Activity Assessment above. Liquidity Payments To attract order flow, enhance liquidity and promote use of our markets, we offer our customers a variety of liquidity payment structures, tailored to specific market, product and customer characteristics. For example, on the NYSE, we provide liquidity payments to DMMs for their role in the revenue we earn under the Regulation NMS formula for quoting the most attractive bid and offer prices in an NMS security. Other liquidity payments include liquidity provider incentive schemes, strategy rebates, block trades and other volume related discounts, reductions to or waivers of transaction fees, a contribution to information technology and staff costs incurred in providing the services and or a share of net transaction fees. Routing and Clearing We incur routing charges in the United States when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our U.S. securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customers order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center 61 Table of Contents charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. Also, NYSE Arca incurs clearance, brokerage and related transaction expenses, which primarily include costs incurred in self clearing activities, service fees paid per trade to exchanges for trade execution, and costs incurred due to erroneous trade execution. Impairment Charges Impairment charges include non cash charges recorded in connection with the write down of certain goodwill, indefinite lived intangible assets and other investments to their estimated fair value. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses include merger expenses and exit costs, compensation, systems and communications, professional services, depreciation and amortization, occupancy and marketing and other. Merger Expenses and Exit Costs Merger expenses and exit costs consist of severance costs and related curtailment losses, depreciation charges triggered by the acceleration of certain fixed asset useful lives, as well as legal and other expenses directly attributable to business combinations and cost reduction initiatives. Compensation Compensation expense includes employee salaries, incentive compensation (including stock based compensation) and related benefits expense, including pension, medical, post retirement medical and supplemental executive retirement plan charges. Part time help, primarily related to security personnel at the NYSE, is also recorded as part of compensation. Systems and Communications Systems and communications expense includes costs for development and maintenance of trading, regulatory and administrative systems; investments in system capacity, reliability and security; and costs of network connectivity between our customers and data centers, as well as connectivity to various other market centers. Systems and communications expense also includes fees paid to third party providers of networks and information technology resources, including fees for consulting, research and development services, software rental costs and licenses, hardware rental and related fees paid to third party maintenance providers. Until the August 2008 acquisition of the 50% stake in AEMS we did not already own, such expenses for Euronext consisted primarily of fees charged by AEMS for information technology services relating to the operation and maintenance of Euronexts cash and derivatives trading platforms, including license fees relating to NSC and LIFFE CONNECT. Following the acquisition of AEMS, we have in sourced our European technology and the results of AEMS have been consolidated in our results of operations. As such, the reduction in systems and communications expense is offset by increases in other components of expenses (including compensation, professional services and occupancy costs). Professional Services Professional services expense includes consulting charges related to various technological and operational initiatives, as well as legal and audit fees. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of costs from depreciating fixed assets (including computer hardware and capitalized software) and amortizing intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. 62 Table of Contents Occupancy Occupancy includes costs related to NYSE Euronexts leased premises, as well as real estate taxes and maintenance of owned premises. Marketing and Other Marketing and other expenses includes advertising, printing and promotion expenses, insurance premiums, travel and entertainment expenses, co branding, investor education and advertising expenses with NYSE listed companies as well as general and administrative expenses. Regulatory Fine Income Regulatory fine income, which we include in our operating income, is generated from fines levied by NYSE Regulation, which regulates and monitors trading on our U.S. securities exchanges. The frequency with which fines may be levied and their amount will vary based upon the actions of participants on our U.S. securities exchanges. Regulatory fines are used only for regulatory purposes. Results of Operations For the year ended December 31, 2008, the results of operations of NYSE Euronext included the results of operations of Wombat, AEMS and NYSE Amex since their respective dates of acquisition (March 7, 2008, August 5, 2008 and October 1, 2008, respectively). For the year ended December 31, 2007, the results of operations of NYSE Euronext included the results of NYSE Group for the full period and the results of operations of Euronext since April 4, 2007, the date that the combination of NYSE Group and Euronext was consummated. For the comparable period in 2006, the results of operations of NYSE Euronext only included the results of NYSE Group. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the results of operations of NYSE Group included the results of operations of NYSE Arca since March 7, 2006, the date the merger of NYSE and Archipelago was consummated. The operations of GL Trade, which were sold on October 1, 2008, are reflected as discontinued. 63 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2008 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2007 The following table sets forth NYSE Euronexts consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each item for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2007.

This compares to revenues (excluding activity assessment fees) of $3,382 million, operating income from continuing operations of $879 million and net income of $643 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $1,092 million increase in revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), $(1,467) million decrease in operating income from continuing operations and $(1,381) million decrease in net income for the period reflect the following principal factors: Increased revenues The period over period increase of $1,092 million in revenues reflects primarily the inclusion of Euronexts results for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE 64 Table of Contents Group and Euronext. Higher trading volumes primarily in the U.S. cash markets and price changes also contributed to the increase in revenues. Higher trading volume increased liquidity payment and routing and clearing expenses, which partially offset increased revenues for the period. Operating (loss) income from continuing operations The period over period decrease in operating income of $(1,467) million was primarily due to impairment charges, higher liquidity payments on higher trading volumes, incremental merger expenses and exit costs as we continue to integrate our businesses, partially offset by revenue growth primarily in cash and derivatives markets. Net (loss) income The period over period decrease in net income of $(1,381) million was primarily due to impairment charges, higher liquidity payments associated with higher trading volumes, incremental merger expenses and exit costs, partially offset by revenue growth primarily in cash and derivatives markets.

Activity assessment fees are collected from member organizations executing trades on US markets. The decrease in activity assessment fees was mainly due to a 63% decline in the related SEC rate. Cash Trading. For the year ended December 31, 2008, U.S. Operations contributed $1,759 million to NYSE Euronexts cash trading revenues, a $594 million increase as compared to December 31, 2007. The primary drivers for this increase were increased handled trading volume on the NYSE Arca platforms and pricing changes on both the NYSE and NYSE Arca trading platforms. European Operations contributed $628 million in cash trading revenues as a result of the inclusion of Euronext for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext, higher trading volumes and favorable currency impact as a result of the strengthening of the Euro versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by price reductions due to the implementation of Pack Epsilon and other pricing changes. Derivatives Trading. For the year ended December 31, 2008, derivatives trading revenues increased by $258 million from the comparable period in 2007 to $919 million, primarily reflecting higher trading volumes, the inclusion of Euronexts results for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext, and the acquisitions of NYSE Liffe US and NYSE Amex. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency impact as a result of the weakening pound sterling (local currency of NYSE Liffe) versus the U.S. dollar. 65 Table of Contents Listing. For the year ended December 31, 2008, listing fees were $395 million, an increase of $10 million from the comparable period in 2007, primarily due to the inclusion of Euronext for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext. Market Data. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, market data revenue increased $58 million to $429 million, primarily due to higher subscriptions and price increase in Europe, as well as the inclusion of Euronexts results for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext. Market data revenues within U.S. Operations were $215 million, a decrease of $10 million from the comparable period a year ago, reflecting a decline in our market share of trading in Tape A securities. Other. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, other revenues decreased $46 million, or 12%, to $344 million. The decrease was primarily due to the lower regulatory revenues as a result of the FINRA divestiture and regulatory pricing changes. Offsetting these decreases were higher software revenues mainly as a result of the acquisition of Wombat and AEMS.

Section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the U.S. government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. NYSE Euronext, in turn, collects activity assessment fees from member organizations executing trades on the NYSE and NYSE Arca. The decrease in Section 31 fees for the year ended December 31, 2008 was due to a 63% decline in the SEC rate collected and subsequently paid as compared to the same period a year ago. Liquidity Payments. For the year ended December 31, 2008, liquidity payments were $1,292 million, an increase of $563 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition to the contribution of European Operations for the full year in 2008, the increase in U.S. Operations reflects (i) increased handled trading volume on the NYSE Arca platform, including the implementation on NYSE Arca, Inc. of an industry wide pilot program for trading designated option contracts in penny increments, which resulted in increased trading volumes, and (ii) pricing and rebate changes implemented during the fourth quarter 2007 and throughout 2008. Routing and Clearing. For the year ended December 31, 2008, routing and clearing fees were $300 million, an increase of $78 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily due to new and increased amount of routing costs incurred as a result of order flow being routed to other market centers. Impairment charges. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded impairment charges of $1,590 million primarily in connection with the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets in our European Operations to their estimated fair value. 66 Table of Contents Other Operating Expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2008, other operating expenses were $1,883 million, an increase of $301 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of results of Euronext for the full year 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, and incremental merger expenses and exit costs following the implementation of cost containment initiatives. Regulatory Fine Income For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, regulatory fine income decreased $27 million to $3 million. Regulatory fines result from actions taken by NYSE Regulation in its oversight of NYSE and NYSE Arca member organizations and, accordingly, may vary period over period. Regulatory fine income was expected to decrease as a result of the transfer of certain functions previously carried out by NYSE Regulation to FINRA effective July 30, 2007. Non operating components of our results of operations were as follows: Interest Expense Interest expense is primarily attributable to the debt incurred to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid to Euronext shareholders in April 2007 as well as debt incurred as part of subsequent transactions. The $21 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to the fact that our debt was outstanding for the full year in 2008 as compared to 2007 when we only started incurring meaningful debt in April following the merger transaction with Euronext. In addition, in the second quarter of 2008, we issued $750 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 750 million ($1,181 million) of fixed rate bonds due in June 2015 in order to, among other things, refinance outstanding commercial paper and lengthen the maturity profile of our debt. These bonds bear interest at fixed rates per annum which are higher than the floating rate on commercial paper for the period. Interest and Investment Income The decrease in the average balance of cash and financial investments, fluctuation of interest rates and general market conditions were the primary drivers of the decrease in interest and investment income. Gain on Sale of Equity Investment and Businesses For the year ended December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext recorded a $4 million gain on sale of equity investment primarily related to Powernext and Endex. For the year ended December 31, 2007, gain on sale of equity investment was $33 million primarily reflecting the sale of the member firm regulatory functions of NYSE Regulation to FINRA. Income from Associates Income from associates reflects NYSE Euronext pro rata share in earnings of equity method investments, primarily AEMS up until the August 5, 2008 acquisition of the remaining 50% stake previously owned by Atos Origin. Subsequent to the acquisition, the results of AEMS have been fully consolidated in our results of operations. Other Income For the year ended December 31, 2008, other income of $37 million primarily reflected foreign exchange and other one time gains. Minority Interest For the year ended December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext recorded minority interest of $5 million primarily representing 2.3% of the Euronext N.V. income for the period from January 1, 2008 to May 20, 2008 (the effective date of the statutory buy out of the remaining minority Euronext shareholders). 67 Table of Contents Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext provided for income taxes at an estimated tax rate of (15)%. Our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to foreign operations and the non deductability of goodwill impairment charges. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the consolidated effective tax rate was 27% which reflected foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. Included in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2007 was a deferred tax benefit of $55 million related to an enacted reduction of the corporate tax rate from 30% to 28% in the United Kingdom. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2006 The following table sets forth NYSE Euronexts consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each item for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2006.

This compares to revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), operating income from continuing operations and net income of $1,703 million, $234 million and $205 million, respectively. The $1,679 million increase in revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), $645 million increase in operating income from continuing operations and $438 million increase in net income for the period reflect the following principal factors: Increased revenues Euronexts results of operations were consolidated following the April 4, 2007 combination with NYSE Group and contributed revenues of $1,191 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was the primary driver of the period over period increase. Higher U.S. trading volumes also contributed to increased revenues, as well as increased liquidity payment and routing and clearing expenses, which partially offset increased revenues for the period. Increased operating income from continuing operations The period over period increase in operating income of $645 million was the result of Euronexts contribution to operating income of $530 million, as well as other revenue growth and overall operating efficiencies as we realize merger synergies. Improved net income Period over period, net income increased $438 million, which was primarily impacted by the consolidation of Euronext, revenue growth and overall operating efficiencies.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, U.S. Operations contributed $1,165 million to NYSE Euronexts cash trading revenues, a $520 million increase as compared to December 31, 2006. The primary drivers of this increase (and their corresponding contributions) were pricing structure changes that were implemented for part of 2006 and for the full period in 2007 on both the NYSE and NYSE Arca (approximately $292 million), increased trading volume (approximately $139 million), and the inclusion of the results of NYSE Arca for the full year 2007 (approximately $89 million). European Operations contributed $410 million in revenues, reflecting the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext, in addition to increased trading volumes due to positive structural trading trends (such as the high frequency of algorithmic trading) and increased market volatility. Derivatives trading. For the year ended December 31, 2007, derivatives trading revenues increased by $630 million from the comparable period in 2006 to $661 million, primarily reflecting the impact of Euronexts business subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext as well as increased market volatility resulting in increased trading volumes both in the U.S. and in Europe. 69 Table of Contents Listing. For the year ended December 31, 2007, listing fees were $385 million, an increase of $29 million from the comparable period in 2006, primarily reflecting the impact of Euronexts business subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext, and an increase in aggregate shares billed for annual fees by U.S. Operations. Market data. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, market data revenue increased $148 million to $371 million, primarily reflecting the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext. Other. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, other revenues decreased $58 million, or 13%, to $390 million. The decrease was primarily due to (i) a $32 million decrease in U.S. Operations regulatory revenue as a result of the completion of the sale of the member firm regulatory functions of NYSE Regulation to FINRA in July 2007, (ii) a $37 million decrease in U.S. Operations software and technology services revenue primarily as a result of a reduction in the amount of services provided by SIAC to its customers, and (iii) a $27 million decrease in U.S. Operations other revenue as a result of the discontinuation of the specialists trading privilege fee in December 2006 and the overall decrease of traders on the NYSEs trading floor. These decreases were partially offset by the European Operations as the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 combination of the businesses of NYSE Group and Euronext.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, liquidity payments were $729 million, an increase of $464 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase reflects (i) changes in the NYSEs pricing structure implemented during December 2006 that included a fixed monthly specialist rebate (representing approximately $92 million), coupled with increased trading volumes on our U.S. cash markets (representing approximately $205 million), (ii) the implementation on NYSE Arca, Inc. of an industry wide pilot program for trading designated options contracts in penny increments, which resulted in increased trading volumes on which liquidity payments were made (representing approximately $20 million), (iii) the inclusion of the results of NYSE Arca for the full year 2007 (representing approximately $44 million), (iv) the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext and (v) increased trading volatility in the European derivatives markets. Routing and Clearing. For the year ended December 31, 2007, routing and clearing fees were $222 million, an increase of $148 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to new and increased amount of routing costs incurred as a result of higher trading volume and order flow being routed to other market centers (representing approximately $133 million) and the inclusion of the results of NYSE Arca for the full year 2007 (representing approximately $15 million). Other Operating Expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2007, other operating expenses were $1,582 million, an increase of $416 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily related to systems and communications ($144 million), depreciation and amortization ($104 million), marketing 70 Table of Contents and other ($69 million), compensation ($54 million), and all others ($45 million). The driver of the increase was primarily as a result of the impact of European Operations, reflecting the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext. Regulatory Fine Income For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, regulatory fine income decreased $6 million to $30 million reflecting, in part, the impact of the creation of FINRA in July 2007 and the transfer to it of certain regulatory functions of NYSE Regulation. Regulatory fines result from actions taken by NYSE Regulation in its oversight of NYSE and NYSE Arca member organizations and, accordingly, may vary period over period. Regulatory fine income will continue to decrease in future periods following the creation of FINRA. Non operating components of our results of operations were as follows: Interest Expense The significant increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the debt incurred to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid to Euronext shareholders in April 2007. Interest and Investment Income Consolidation of interest and investment income from Euronext and the favorable impact of rising interest rates on cash, cash equivalents and financial investments were the primary factors in the $25 million increase in interest and investment income. Gain on Sale of Equity Investment and Businesses For the year ended December 31, 2007, NYSE Euronext recorded a $32 million gain on the sale of the member firm regulatory functions of NYSE Regulation to FINRA. Income from Associates Income from associates reflects NYSE Euronext pro rata share in earnings of equity method investments, including AEMS, MTS (through its disposition on September 14, 2007) and Powernext. Other Income For the year ended December 31, 2007, other income of $30 million primarily reflected the receipt of insurance reimbursements, which may vary period over period. Minority Interest For the year ended December 31, 2007, NYSE Euronext recorded minority interest of $10 million primarily representing 2.32% of the Euronext income for the period, which corresponds to the percentage of voting rights that were not tendered during the initial exchange offer period. During the comparable period in 2006, NYSE Euronext recorded minority interest until November 1, 2006 when it purchased the one third ownership stake in SIAC previously held by NYSE Amex. Income Taxes The consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 27% which reflects foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. Included in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2007 was a deferred tax benefit of $55 million related to an enacted reduction of the corporate tax rate from 30% to 28% in the United Kingdom. For the year ended December 31, 2006, NYSE Euronexts effective rate was 37%, lower than the statutory rate primarily as a result of federal and state tax credits. 71 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources NYSE Euronexts financial policy seeks to finance the growth of its business, remunerate shareholders and ensure financial flexibility, while maintaining strong creditworthiness and liquidity. NYSE Euronexts primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, current assets and existing bank facilities. NYSE Euronexts principal liquidity requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate use. Cash Flows From Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $721 million. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $376 million. Under the terms of the operating agreement of the NYSE, no regulatory fees, fines or penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be distributed to NYSE Euronext or any entity other than NYSE Regulation. As a result, the use of regulatory fees, fines and penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be considered restricted. As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext did not have significant restricted cash balances. Net Financial Indebtedness As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext had approximately $3.1 billion in debt outstanding and $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and financial investments, resulting in $2.1 billion in net indebtedness. We define net indebtedness as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents and financial investments. Net indebtedness was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 777 $ 934 Current investments 236 557 Securities purchased under agreements to resell 9 Cash, cash equivalents and financial investments 1,013 1,500 Short term debt 1,350 2,164 Long term debt 1,787 494 Total debt 3,137 2,658 Net indebtedness $ 2,124 $ 1,158 Cash, cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronexts main debt instruments were as follows (in millions): Principal amount Maturity Commercial paper issued under the global commercial paper program $692 From January 2, 2009until March 16, 2009 Bond in sterling &pound;250($365) June 16, 2009 4.8% bond in U.S. dollar $750 June 30, 2013 5.375% bond in Euro 750($1,044) June 30, 2015 Bank overdraft $249 72 Table of Contents The &pound;250 million ($365 million) fixed rate bonds were issued in 2004 to refinance the acquisition of LIFFE (Holdings) plc by Euronext and were swapped to floating rate using a fixed to floating rate swap. As of December 31, 2008, taking into account this swap, the effective interest rate on the bonds was 3.3%. The bonds mature in June 2009. In 2007, NYSE Euronext entered into a U.S. dollar and euro denominated global commercial paper program of $3.0 billion in order to refinance the acquisition of the Euronext shares. As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext had $0.7 billion of debt outstanding at an average interest rate of 2.9% under this commercial paper program. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (Libor U.S. for commercial paper issued in U.S. dollar and Euribor for commercial paper issued in euro). The fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may therefore impact the interest expense incurred by NYSE Euronext. The commercial paper program is backed by a $2.0 billion 5 year syndicated revolving bank facility maturing on April 4, 2012 and a $1.0 billion 364 day syndicated revolving bank facility maturing on April 1, 2009. These bank facilities are also available for general corporate purposes and were not drawn as of December 31, 2008. On September 15, 2008, the amount of commitments readily available to NYSE Euronext under the $2.0 billion April 2012 facility decreased from $2.0 billion to $1,833 million as a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which had provided a $167 million commitment under this facility. In August 2006, prior to the combination with NYSE Group, Euronext entered into a 300 million ($418 million) revolving credit facility available for general corporate purposes, which matures on August 4, 2011. On a combined basis, as of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext had three committed bank credit facilities totaling $3.2 billion, with no amount outstanding under any of these facilities. The commercial paper program and the credit facilities include terms and conditions customary for agreements of this type, which may restrict NYSE Euronexts ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness. In the second quarter of 2008, NYSE Euronext issued $750 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 750 million ($1,181 million) of fixed rate bonds due in June 2015 in order to, among other things, refinance outstanding commercial paper and lengthen the maturity profile of its debt. These bonds bear interest at a rate per annum of 4.8% and 5.375%, respectively. The terms of the bonds do not contain any financial covenants. The bonds may be redeemed by NYSE Euronext or the bond holders under certain customary circumstances, including a change in control. The terms of the bonds also provide for customary events of default and a negative pledge covenant. Liquidity Risk NYSE Euronext continually reviews its liquidity and debt positions, and subject to market conditions and credit and strategic considerations, may from time to time determine to vary the maturity profile of its debt and diversify its sources of financing. NYSE Euronext anticipates being able to support short term liquidity and operating needs primarily through existing cash balances and financing arrangements, along with future cash flows from operations. If existing financing arrangements are insufficient to meet anticipated needs or to refinance existing debt, NYSE Euronext may seek additional financing in either the debt or equity markets. NYSE Euronext may also seek equity or debt financing in connection with future acquisitions or other strategic transactions. While we believe that we generally have access to debt markets, including bank facilities and publicly and privately issued long and short term debt, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. The commercial paper market experienced disruptions in the second half of 2008. Because new issues of commercial paper generally fund the retirement of outstanding issues, NYSE Euronext is also exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to refinance outstanding commercial paper. In order to mitigate the rollover risk, NYSE Euronext maintains backstop bank facilities for an aggregate amount exceeding at any time the amount issued under its commercial paper program. In the event of severe disruptions in the commercial paper market, NYSE Euronext would have the ability to draw on these backstop facilities. 73 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Program The board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of NYSE Euronext common stock. Subsequent to the October 1, 2008 acquisition of NYSE Amex, NYSE Euronext commenced repurchases under this authorization, and NYSE Euronext plans to repurchase stock from time to time at the discretion of management in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to applicable U.S. and European laws, regulations and approvals, strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors. As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext had repurchased 13.4 million shares at an average price of $26.04 per share. Under SEC rules, NYSE Euronext will not be able to repurchase shares during certain restricted time periods. Dividends In June 2007, the board of directors declared an annual cash dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock, payable on a quarterly basis. Quarterly dividends of $0.25 per share were paid on July 13, 2007, December 28, 2007 and March 31, 2008. In March 2008, the board of directors approved an increase in NYSE Euronexts annual dividend, to $1.20 per share of common stock. Quarterly dividends of $0.30 per share were paid on June 30, 2008, September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2008. A quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share is scheduled to be paid on March 31, 2009. On February 9, 2009, NYSE Euronext announced that its board of directors had determined to maintain NYSE Euronexts quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share through 2009. Summary Disclosures About Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes NYSE Euronexts debt and future minimum lease obligations on its operating leases as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): Payments due by year(1) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Debt (principal and accrued interest obligations) $3,137 $ 1,350 $ $ $ $ 748 $ 1,039 Debt (future interest obligations) 550 72 92 92 92 74 128 Operating lease obligations 648 121 109 74 66 54 224 Other commitments(2) 624 621 3 $4,959 $ 2,164 $ 204 $ 166 $ 158 $ 876 $ 1,391 (1) As of December 31, 2008, obligations under capital leases were not significant. NYSE Euronext also has obligations related to unrecognized tax positions, deferred compensation and other post retirement benefits. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined. See Notes 8 Pension and Other Benefit Programs, 10 Stock Based Compensation, and 15 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Including in 2009, $250 million for the acquisition of a 25% ownership interest in the Doha Securities Market and 260 million ($362 million) for NYSE Liffe Clearing. As previously announced, we are currently in discussions to restructure the equity investment portion of the transaction, which will likely reduce our ownership interest to 20% and our cost to $200 million, payable over several years. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following provides information about NYSE Euronexts critical accounting policies and estimates. Critical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially produce materially different results, assumptions and conditions. Revenue Recognition There are two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our exchanges listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate action. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company 74 Table of Contents initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are not applicable to companies when they list on the NYSE or NYSE Arca in the context of a transfer from another market. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares. Annual fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original listing fees are recognized on a straight line basis over their estimated service periods of 10 years for NYSE and Euronext, and 5 years for NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, NYSE Euronext, through Wombat, licenses software and provides software services which are accounted for in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, which involves significant judgment. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets NYSE Euronext reviews the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based upon estimated fair value of NYSE Euronexts reporting units. Should the review indicate that goodwill is impaired, NYSE Euronexts goodwill would be reduced by the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its fair value. NYSE Euronext reviews the useful life of its indefinite lived intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life categorization. In addition, the carrying value of NYSE Euronexts other intangible assets is reviewed by NYSE Euronext at least annually for impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the asset. For purposes of performing the impairment test, fair values are determined using discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which, among other factors, is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long term rate of growth for businesses, and determination of weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill and other intangible impairment for each reporting unit. Income Taxes NYSE Euronext records income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and tax bases in assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided for certain tax carryforwards. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. NYSE Euronext is subject to numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions primarily based on its operations in these jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in NYSE Euronexts financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could have material impact on NYSE Euronexts financial position or results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Employee Benefits Pension and Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with the U.S. 75 Table of Contents generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect NYSE Euronexts pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense. Hedging Activities NYSE Euronext uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. NYSE Euronext accounts for derivatives pursuant to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires that all derivatives be recorded at fair value on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in other comprehensive income or net income depending on whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in cash flows or changes in fair value. New Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)), requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to: (1) recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally at their acquisition date fair values; (2) record those assets and liabilities at their full fair value amounts even if there is noncontrolling (minority) interest; (3) include noncontrolling interest earnings through net income; (4) expense acquisition related transaction costs; and (5) disclose information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for NYSE Euronext for any acquisitions occurring in 2009 and years thereafter. SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No. 160), which is to be retrospectively applied, requires entities to include noncontrolling (minority) interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries within shareholders equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 also requires the consolidating entity to include the earnings of the consolidated subsidiary attributable to the noncontrolling interest holder in its income statement with an offsetting charge (credit) to the non controlling interest in shareholders equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective for NYSE Euronext beginning January 1, 2009. SFAS No. 161, Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS No. 161) is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entitys derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 applies to all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133. It also applies to non derivative hedging instruments and all hedged items designated and qualifying as hedges under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 161 amends the current qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities set forth in SFAS No. 133 and generally increases the level of disaggregation that will be required in an entitys financial statements. SFAS No. 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS No. 161 is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. 76 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK General As a result of its operating and financing activities, NYSE Euronext is exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, currency risk, credit risk and equity risk. NYSE Euronext has implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. NYSE Euronexts central treasury is charged with identifying risk exposures and monitoring and managing such risks on a daily basis. To the extent allowed by local regulation and necessary, NYSE Euronexts subsidiaries centralize their cash investments, report their risks and hedge their exposures with the central treasury. NYSE Euronext performs sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have. NYSE Euronext uses derivative instruments solely to hedge financial risks related to its financial positions or risks that are otherwise incurred in the normal course of its commercial activities. It does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Most of NYSE Euronexts financial assets and liabilities are based on floating rates, on fixed rates with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in less than one year or on fixed rates that have been swapped to floating rates via fixed to floating rate swaps. The following table summarizes NYSE Euronexts exposure to interest rate risk as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): Financial assets Financialliabilities NetExposure Impact(2) of a100 bps adverseshift in interestrates(3) Floating rate(1) positions in Dollar 365 238 127 (1.3 ) Euro 304 745 (441 ) (4.4 ) Sterling 258 368 (4) (110 ) (1.1 ) Fixed rate positions in Dollar 1 748 (747 ) (28.9 ) Euro 1,039 (1,039 ) (51.7 ) Sterling (1) Includes floating rate, fixed rate with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in less than one year and fixed rate swapped to floating rate. (2) Impact on profit and loss for floating rate positions (cash flow risk) and on equity until realization in profit and loss for fixed rate positions (price risk). (3) 100 basis points parallel shift of yield curve. (4) Includes the effect of the fixed to floating interest rate swap on the &pound;250 million fixed rate bond issuance. In order to hedge interest rate exposures, NYSE Euronext may enter into interest rate derivative instruments, such as swaps, with counterparties that meet high creditworthiness and rating standards. At December 31, 2008, the only significant outstanding interest rate hedge was a fixed to floating rate swap hedging the &pound;250 million ($365 million) fixed rate bond issuance denominated in sterling. NYSE Euronext is exposed to price risk on its outstanding fixed rate positions. At December 31, 2008, fixed rate positions in U.S. dollar and in euro with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in more than one year amounted to $747 million and $1,039 million, respectively. A hypothetical shift of 1% in the U.S. dollar or in the euro interest rate curves would in the aggregate impact the fair value of these positions by $28.9 million and $51.7 million, respectively. 77 Table of Contents NYSE Euronext is exposed to cash flow risk on its floating rate positions. Because NYSE Euronext is a net lender in the U.S. dollar, when interest rates in the U.S. dollar decrease, NYSE Euronexts net interest and investment income decreases. Based on December 31, 2008 positions, a hypothetical 1% decrease in U.S. dollar rates would negatively impact annual income by $1.3 million. Because NYSE Euronext is a net borrower in euro and sterling, when interest rates in euro or sterling increase, NYSE Euronext net interest and investment income decreases. Based on December 31, 2008 positions, a hypothetical 1% increase in euro and sterling rates would negatively impact annual income by $4.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Currency Risk As an international group, NYSE Euronext is subject to currency translation risk. A significant part of NYSE Euronexts assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses is recorded in euro and sterling. Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. NYSE Euronexts exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the year ended December 31, 2008 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2008 Euro Sterling Average rate in the period $ 1.4708 $ 1.8526 Average rate in the same period one year before $ 1.3710 $ 2.0015 Foreign denominated percentage of Revenues 23% 14% Operating expenses (1) 15% 12% Operating income (1) 52% 21% Impact of the currency fluctuations (2) on Revenues $ 30.8 $ (76.3 ) Operating expenses (1) 22.8 (58.3 ) Operating income (1) 8.0 (19.0 ) (1) Excluding $1,590 million impairment charges recorded in 2008. (2) Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in the prior year. NYSE Euronexts exposure to net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions): December 31, 2008 Position in euros Position in sterling Assets 4,399 &pound; 2,730 of which goodwill 1,049 1,074 Liabilities 2,440 682 of which borrowings 1,279 252 Net currency position before hedging activities 1,959 2,048 Impact of hedging activities 40 Net currency position 1,959 &pound; 2,088 Impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates $ (273 ) $ (305 ) 78 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext was exposed to net exposures in euro and sterling of 2.0 billion ($2.7 billion) and &pound;2.1 billion ($3.1 billion), respectively. NYSE Euronexts borrowings in euro and sterling of 1.3 billion ($1.8 billion) and &pound;0.3 billion ($0.4 billion), respectively, constitute a partial hedge of NYSE Euronexts net investments in foreign entities. As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext also had a &pound;40 million ($61 million) sterling/dollar foreign exchange swap outstanding. This swap matured in January 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value of this swap was a $2.7 million liability. Based on December 31, 2008 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of the euro against the dollar would negatively impact NYSE Euronexts equity by $273 million and a hypothetical 10% decrease of the sterling against the dollar would negatively impact NYSE Euronexts equity by $305 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of $1.4 billion on NYSE Euronexts consolidated equity. Credit Risk NYSE Euronext is exposed to credit risk in the event of a counterparty default. NYSE Euronext limits its exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which it makes investments and executes agreements. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. NYSE Euronexts investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. NYSE Euronext seeks to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties. An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, NYSE Euronexts policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements. Actual results may differ from such forward looking statements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. Certain prior period amounts presented in the discussion and analysis have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Overview NYSE Euronext was formed from the combination of the businesses of NYSE Group and Euronext, which was consummated on April 4, 2007. Prior to that date, NYSE Euronext had no significant assets and did not conduct any material activities other than those incidental to its formation. Following consummation of the combination, NYSE Euronext became the parent company of NYSE Group and Euronext and each of their respective subsidiaries. Under the purchase method of accounting, NYSE Group was treated as the accounting and legal acquiror in the combination with Euronext. On October 1, 2008, NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of The Amex Membership Corporation, including its subsidiary the American Stock Exchange, which is now known as NYSE Amex. NYSE Euronext evaluates segment performance primarily based on operating income. Following the combination of the businesses of NYSE Group and Euronext, NYSE Euronext operates under two reportable segments: U.S. Operations and European Operations. U.S. Operations consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts U.S. markets: obtaining new listings and servicing existing listings, providing access to trade execution in cash equities and options, selling market data and related information and distributing market information to data subscribers, issuing trading permits, providing data processing operations, providing regulatory services, and providing trading technology, software and connectivity to end users. European Operations consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts European markets: providing access to trade execution in all cash products as well as a wide range of derivatives products, providing listing services, selling market data and related information, providing transaction settlement and for the safe custody of physical securities, and providing electronic trading solutions as well as software and connectivity to end users. In January 2009, we created NYSE Technologies (NYXT) to combine the businesses formerly known as NYSE Euronext Advanced Trading Solutions (including NYSE TransactTools, Wombat, and AEMS) and our global market data businesses. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this organizational change on our segment reporting structure going forward. 55 Table of Contents Factors Affecting Our Results The business environment in which NYSE Euronext operates directly affects its results of operations. Our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors, including the level of trading activity in our markets, which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions, competition and market share, broad trends in the brokerage and finance industry, price levels and price volatility, the number and financial health of companies listed on NYSE Euronexts cash markets, changing technology in the financial services industry, and legislative and regulatory changes, among other factors. In particular, in recent years, the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings, the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors, market participants demand for speed, capacity and reliability, which requires continuing investment in technology, and increasing competition for market data revenues. For example, while total trading volumes have been increasing, the growth of our trading and market data revenues could be adversely impacted if we are unsuccessful in attracting additional volumes. The maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing. During 2008, there was turmoil in the economy and upheaval in the credit markets. Equity market indices declined throughout the year, with particularly sharp declines and higher volatility in September and October. Lower levels of economic activity and uncertainty regarding the capital markets can result in a decline in trading volume and deterioration of the economic welfare of our listed companies, which can adversely affect our revenues and future growth. Declines in volumes can also impact our market share and pricing structures. As a result of these economic and market changes, certain of our assets have been impaired. See Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Assets. These disruptions and developments have resulted in a range of actions by the U.S. and foreign governments to attempt to bring liquidity and order to the financial markets and to prevent a prolonged recession in the world economy. Securities and banking regulators have also been active in establishing temporary rules and regulations to respond to this crisis. Some of these actions have resulted in temporary or, in some cases, permanent, restrictions on certain types of securities transactions, most notably short sales of equity securities of certain financial institutions. We cannot predict whether these government efforts will be successful. Dislocation in the credit markets has led to increased liquidity risk. While we have not experienced reductions in our borrowing capacity, lenders in general have taken actions that indicate their concerns regarding liquidity in the marketplace. These actions have included reduced advance rates for certain security types, more stringent requirements for collateral eligibility and higher interest rates. Should lenders continue to take additional similar actions, the cost of conducting our business may increase and our ability to implement our business initiatives could be limited. We expect that all of these factors may have an impact on our businesses. Any potential growth in the global cash markets in the upcoming months will likely be tempered by investor uncertainty resulting from volatility in the cost of energy and commodities, unemployment and recession concerns, as well as the general state of the world economy. Recent Acquisitions AEMS On August 5, 2008, NYSE Euronext completed the acquisition of the 50% stake in AEMS previously owned by Atos Origin. Through the transaction, NYSE Euronext acquired (i) the NSC cash trading and LIFFE CONNECT derivatives trading platform technology, and all of the management and development services surrounding these platforms, (ii) AEMSs third party exchange technology business, and (iii) TRS/CPS, clearing software. The purchase price in the transaction was approximately 162 million ($255 million), net of approximately 120 million ($189 million) of cash acquired, and is subject to certain post closing adjustments. The results of operations and financial condition of AEMS have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the August 5, 2008 acquisition. Going forward, we have branded our technology business, including AEMS, as NYSE Technologies or NYXT. See Item 1 Business Technology. 56 Table of Contents NYSE Amex On October 1, 2008, NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of The Amex Membership Corporation. NYSE Euronext acquired the business of The Amex Membership Corporation, including its subsidiary the American Stock Exchange (now known as NYSE Amex). In the transaction, each holder of a regular membership of The Amex Membership Corporation became entitled to receive approximately 8,100 shares of NYSE Euronext common stock and each holder of an options principal membership became entitled to receive approximately 7,200 shares of NYSE Euronext common stock. A total of approximately 6.8 million shares of NYSE Euronext common stock were issued with a value of approximately $260 million. In addition, each former holder of a regular or options principal membership will be entitled to receive additional consideration calculated by reference to the net proceeds, if any, from the sale of the NYSE Amex headquarters in lower Manhattan, if such sale occurs within a specified period of time and certain conditions are satisfied. Other Transactions In 2008, we completed the statutory buy out of the remaining Euronext shareholders who held approximately 2.3% of the shares of Euronext N.V. and also completed the acquisition of Wombat, a privately held global leader in high performance financial market data management solutions. In addition, NYSE Liffe US, the new U.S. futures exchange of NYSE Euronext, received DCM status in August 2008 and began trading full and e mini gold and silver futures and options on futures contracts in September 2008. Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Assets Testing Methodology and Valuation Considerations Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable assets of a business acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142), we test goodwill of our reporting units (which is generally one level below our two reportable segments) and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. We perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter. The impairment test of goodwill is performed in two steps. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In determining the fair value of its reporting units in step one of the goodwill impairment test, we compute the present value of discounted cash flows and terminal value projected for the reporting unit. The rate used to discount cash flows represents the weighted average cost of capital that we believe is reflective of the relevant risk associated with the projected cash flows. To validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of the reporting units determined in step one of the goodwill impairment test to the market capitalization of NYSE Euronext to derive the implied control premium. In performing this reconciliation, we may, depending on the volatility of our stock price, use either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, generally 30 days. We compare the implied control premium to premiums paid in observable recent transactions of comparable companies to determine if the fair value of the reporting units estimated in step one of the goodwill impairment test is reasonable. 57 Table of Contents In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets (SFAS No. 144), impairment exists when the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from it. An intangible asset subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of the intangible asset, indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as, but not limited to, the reporting unit at which goodwill should be measured for impairment, future operating performance and cash flows, cost of capital, terminal values, control premiums, remaining economic lives of assets, and the allocation of shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, in order to determine whether a decline in the value of certain securities and other investments is other than temporary, and among other factors, we evaluate the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost. In particular, we consider the impact of duration and severity on the period of time expected for recovery to occur. If we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary, we write down the carrying value of the related asset to its estimated fair value. Results of Impairment Tests Based upon tests performed during the fourth quarter of 2008, NYSE Euronext recorded the following impairment charges (in millions): Goodwill $ 1,003 (1) Other intangible assets, net 522 (2) Other 65 (3) Total impairment charges $ 1,590 (1) For the goodwill allocated to our European Cash reporting unit. (2) For the national securities exchange registration of our European Cash reporting unit. (3) Includes impairment losses recorded in connection with our investment in BM&F Bovespa ($57 million) and other investments ($8 million). The impairment charges reflect current economic conditions, adverse equity market conditions which have caused a material decline in industry market multiples, and lower estimated future cash flows of our European Cash reporting unit as a result of increased competition which has caused a decline in our market share of cash trading in Europe as well as pricing pressures following the November 2007 introduction of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). Sources of Revenues Activity Assessment Our U.S. securities exchanges pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. These Section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. NYSE Group, in turn, collects activity assessment fees from member organizations executing trades on our U.S. securities exchanges, and recognizes these amounts when invoiced. 58 Table of Contents Fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and Section 31 fees do not have an impact on NYSE Euronexts net income. Cash Trading In our U.S. Operations, NYSE charges transaction fees for executing trades in NYSE listed equities on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, and NYSE Amex, as well as on orders that are routed to other market centers for execution. Changes to the pricing structure throughout 2007 and 2008 allowed further alignment of transaction revenue with executed volume. In our European Operations, Euronext generates cash trading revenue from fees charged primarily for the execution of trades of equity and debt securities and other cash instruments on Euronexts cash market, which is comprised of the separate cash markets operated in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris. Revenue from cash trading in any given period depends primarily on the number of shares traded on our U.S. securities exchanges, the number of trades executed on Euronext, and the fees charged for execution. The level of trading activity in any period is significantly influenced by a number of factors. See Factors Affecting Our Results. NYSE Euronexts cash trading pricing structures continue to be examined closely as part of a broad strategic review of NYSE Euronexts opportunities for revenue growth and efficiency improvement. As a result, we have and may continue to periodically modify our trading pricing structures. NYSE Euronext seeks to better capture value for the services it renders by aligning more closely transaction revenue with executed volume, product expansion and new product development. For example, effective October 1, 2008, we began offering a global pricing rebate to our European customers who exceed certain volume thresholds on each of our Euronext, NYSE and NYSE Arca trading platforms. Transaction fees that NYSE Euronext earns in the future could also continue to depend on the effect of certain regulations and rule changes, such as MiFID, which have the potential to impact the competitive environment in which NYSE Euronext operates. Derivatives Trading Revenue from derivatives trading consists of fixed per contract fees for executing trades of derivatives contracts on NYSE Liffe and executing options contracts traded on NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. In some cases, these fees are subject to caps. Revenues for fixed per contract fees are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract. The principal types of derivative contracts traded are equity and index products and short term interest rate products. Trading in equity products is primarily driven by price volatility in equity markets and indices and trading in short term interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from uncertainty over the direction of short term interest rates. The level of trading activity for all products is also influenced by market conditions and other factors. See Factors Affecting Our Results. Listings There are two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our U.S. and European securities exchanges listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate related actions. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are not applicable to companies that transfer to one of our U.S. securities exchanges from another listing venue. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be 59 Table of Contents listed, such as stock splits, rights issues, sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee. Annual fees in the U.S. are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of the listed company at the end of the prior year. Non U.S. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the United States. Annual fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original fees are recognized as income on a straight line basis over estimated service periods of ten years for the NYSE and the Euronext cash equities markets and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Listing fees for the Euronext subsidiaries comprise admission fees paid by issuers to list securities on the cash market, annual fees paid by companies whose financial instruments are listed on the cash market, and corporate activity and other fees, consisting primarily of fees charged by Euronext Paris for centralizing shares in IPOs and tender offers. Revenues from listing fees relate primarily to the number of shares outstanding. In general, Euronext has adopted a common set of listing fees for Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels and Euronext Lisbon. Under the harmonized fee book, domestic issuers (i.e., those from France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal) pay admission fees to list their securities based on the market capitalization of the respective issuer. Subsequent listings of securities receive a 50% discount on admission fees. Non domestic companies are charged admission and annual fees on a similar basis, although they are charged lower maximum admission fees and annual fees. Euronext Paris and Euronext Lisbon also charge centralization fees for collecting and allocating retail investor orders in IPOs and tender offers. The revenue NYSE Euronext derives from listing fees is primarily dependent on the number and size of new company listings and tender offers. The number and size of new company listings and tender offers in any period depend primarily on factors outside of NYSE Euronexts control, including general economic conditions in Europe and the United States (in particular, stock market conditions) and the success of competing stock exchanges in attracting and retaining listed companies. Market Data In our U.S. Operations we collect market data fees principally for consortium based data products, also known as core data products, and, to a lesser extent, for NYSE proprietary data products, also known as non core data products. Consortium based data fees are dictated as part of the securities industry plans. Consortium based data revenues from the dissemination of market data (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of a formula set by the SEC under Regulation NMS. Last sale prices and quotes in NYSE listed securities are disseminated through Tape A, which constitutes the majority of the NYSEs revenues from consortium based market data revenues. We also receive a share of the revenues from Tape B and Tape C, which represents data related to trading of certain securities that are listed on NYSE Arca, NYSE Amex, other regional exchanges and Nasdaq, respectively. These revenues are influenced by demand for the data by professional and nonprofessional subscribers. In addition, we receive fees for the display of data on television and for vendor access. Our proprietary products make market data available to subscribers covering activity that takes place solely on our U.S. markets, independent of activity on other markets. Our proprietary data products also include the sale of depth of book information, historical price information and corporate action information. The SEC approved a pilot program through March 31, 2009 for a new data product, NYSE Euronext Real Time Reference Prices, which allows Internet and media organizations to buy real time, last sale market data from NYSE and provide it broadly and free of charge to the public. CNBC, Google Finance and nyse.com are now displaying NYSE Real Time stock prices on their respective websites. In our European Operations we charge a variety of users, primarily the end users, for the use of real time market data services. We also collect annual license fees from vendors for the right to distribute market data to third parties and a service fee from vendors for direct connection to market data. A substantial majority of our 60 Table of Contents European market data revenues is derived from monthly end user fees. We also derive revenues from selling historical and reference data about securities, and by publishing the daily official lists for the Euronext markets. The principal drivers of market data revenues are the number of end users and the prices for data packages. Other Revenues Other revenues include software and technology services and regulatory revenues, as well as trading license fees and other fees, fees for facilities and other services provided to specialists, brokers and clerks physically located on the floors of our U.S. markets that enable them to engage in the purchase and sale of securities on the trading floor, and fees for clearance and settlement activities in our European Operations. Software and Technology Services. We generate revenues from connectivity services related to the SFTI network, software license and maintenance fees, and strategic consulting services. Customers pay to gain access to SFTI market centers via direct circuit to a SFTI access point or through a third party service bureau or extranet provider. SFTI revenue typically includes a connection fee and monthly recurring revenue based on a customers connection bandwidth. Hardware co location services are also offered at SFTI data centers, and customers typically sign multi year contracts. Co location revenue is recognized monthly over the life of the contract. Revenue is also earned from sales of our enterprise software platform, which provides low latency messaging and trade lifecycle management. Software license revenue is recorded at the time of sale, and maintenance contracts are recognized monthly over the life of the maintenance term. Unrealized portions of invoiced maintenance fees are recorded as deferred revenue. Expert consulting services are offered for customization or installation of the software and for general advisory services. Consulting revenue is generally billed in arrears on a time and materials basis, although customers sometimes prepay for blocks of consulting services in bulk. Prepaid consulting revenue is booked as deferred revenue until the services are rendered. We also generate revenues from software license contracts and maintenance agreements. We provide software which allows customers to receive comprehensive market agnostic connectivity, transaction and data management solutions. Software license revenues are recognized at the time of client acceptance and maintenance agreements revenues are recognized monthly over the life of the maintenance term subsequent to acceptance. Regulatory. Regulatory fees are charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges. Components of Expenses Section 31 Fees See Sources of Revenues Activity Assessment above. Liquidity Payments To attract order flow, enhance liquidity and promote use of our markets, we offer our customers a variety of liquidity payment structures, tailored to specific market, product and customer characteristics. For example, on the NYSE, we provide liquidity payments to DMMs for their role in the revenue we earn under the Regulation NMS formula for quoting the most attractive bid and offer prices in an NMS security. Other liquidity payments include liquidity provider incentive schemes, strategy rebates, block trades and other volume related discounts, reductions to or waivers of transaction fees, a contribution to information technology and staff costs incurred in providing the services and or a share of net transaction fees. Routing and Clearing We incur routing charges in the United States when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our U.S. securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customers order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center 61 Table of Contents charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. Also, NYSE Arca incurs clearance, brokerage and related transaction expenses, which primarily include costs incurred in self clearing activities, service fees paid per trade to exchanges for trade execution, and costs incurred due to erroneous trade execution. Impairment Charges Impairment charges include non cash charges recorded in connection with the write down of certain goodwill, indefinite lived intangible assets and other investments to their estimated fair value. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses include merger expenses and exit costs, compensation, systems and communications, professional services, depreciation and amortization, occupancy and marketing and other. Merger Expenses and Exit Costs Merger expenses and exit costs consist of severance costs and related curtailment losses, depreciation charges triggered by the acceleration of certain fixed asset useful lives, as well as legal and other expenses directly attributable to business combinations and cost reduction initiatives. Compensation Compensation expense includes employee salaries, incentive compensation (including stock based compensation) and related benefits expense, including pension, medical, post retirement medical and supplemental executive retirement plan charges. Part time help, primarily related to security personnel at the NYSE, is also recorded as part of compensation. Systems and Communications Systems and communications expense includes costs for development and maintenance of trading, regulatory and administrative systems; investments in system capacity, reliability and security; and costs of network connectivity between our customers and data centers, as well as connectivity to various other market centers. Systems and communications expense also includes fees paid to third party providers of networks and information technology resources, including fees for consulting, research and development services, software rental costs and licenses, hardware rental and related fees paid to third party maintenance providers. Until the August 2008 acquisition of the 50% stake in AEMS we did not already own, such expenses for Euronext consisted primarily of fees charged by AEMS for information technology services relating to the operation and maintenance of Euronexts cash and derivatives trading platforms, including license fees relating to NSC and LIFFE CONNECT. Following the acquisition of AEMS, we have in sourced our European technology and the results of AEMS have been consolidated in our results of operations. As such, the reduction in systems and communications expense is offset by increases in other components of expenses (including compensation, professional services and occupancy costs). Professional Services Professional services expense includes consulting charges related to various technological and operational initiatives, as well as legal and audit fees. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of costs from depreciating fixed assets (including computer hardware and capitalized software) and amortizing intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. 62 Table of Contents Occupancy Occupancy includes costs related to NYSE Euronexts leased premises, as well as real estate taxes and maintenance of owned premises. Marketing and Other Marketing and other expenses includes advertising, printing and promotion expenses, insurance premiums, travel and entertainment expenses, co branding, investor education and advertising expenses with NYSE listed companies as well as general and administrative expenses. Regulatory Fine Income Regulatory fine income, which we include in our operating income, is generated from fines levied by NYSE Regulation, which regulates and monitors trading on our U.S. securities exchanges. The frequency with which fines may be levied and their amount will vary based upon the actions of participants on our U.S. securities exchanges. Regulatory fines are used only for regulatory purposes. Results of Operations For the year ended December 31, 2008, the results of operations of NYSE Euronext included the results of operations of Wombat, AEMS and NYSE Amex since their respective dates of acquisition (March 7, 2008, August 5, 2008 and October 1, 2008, respectively). For the year ended December 31, 2007, the results of operations of NYSE Euronext included the results of NYSE Group for the full period and the results of operations of Euronext since April 4, 2007, the date that the combination of NYSE Group and Euronext was consummated. For the comparable period in 2006, the results of operations of NYSE Euronext only included the results of NYSE Group. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the results of operations of NYSE Group included the results of operations of NYSE Arca since March 7, 2006, the date the merger of NYSE and Archipelago was consummated. The operations of GL Trade, which were sold on October 1, 2008, are reflected as discontinued. 63 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2008 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2007 The following table sets forth NYSE Euronexts consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each item for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2007.

This compares to revenues (excluding activity assessment fees) of $3,382 million, operating income from continuing operations of $879 million and net income of $643 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $1,092 million increase in revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), $(1,467) million decrease in operating income from continuing operations and $(1,381) million decrease in net income for the period reflect the following principal factors: Increased revenues The period over period increase of $1,092 million in revenues reflects primarily the inclusion of Euronexts results for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE 64 Table of Contents Group and Euronext. Higher trading volumes primarily in the U.S. cash markets and price changes also contributed to the increase in revenues. Higher trading volume increased liquidity payment and routing and clearing expenses, which partially offset increased revenues for the period. Operating (loss) income from continuing operations The period over period decrease in operating income of $(1,467) million was primarily due to impairment charges, higher liquidity payments on higher trading volumes, incremental merger expenses and exit costs as we continue to integrate our businesses, partially offset by revenue growth primarily in cash and derivatives markets. Net (loss) income The period over period decrease in net income of $(1,381) million was primarily due to impairment charges, higher liquidity payments associated with higher trading volumes, incremental merger expenses and exit costs, partially offset by revenue growth primarily in cash and derivatives markets.

Activity assessment fees are collected from member organizations executing trades on US markets. The decrease in activity assessment fees was mainly due to a 63% decline in the related SEC rate. Cash Trading. For the year ended December 31, 2008, U.S. Operations contributed $1,759 million to NYSE Euronexts cash trading revenues, a $594 million increase as compared to December 31, 2007. The primary drivers for this increase were increased handled trading volume on the NYSE Arca platforms and pricing changes on both the NYSE and NYSE Arca trading platforms. European Operations contributed $628 million in cash trading revenues as a result of the inclusion of Euronext for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext, higher trading volumes and favorable currency impact as a result of the strengthening of the Euro versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by price reductions due to the implementation of Pack Epsilon and other pricing changes. Derivatives Trading. For the year ended December 31, 2008, derivatives trading revenues increased by $258 million from the comparable period in 2007 to $919 million, primarily reflecting higher trading volumes, the inclusion of Euronexts results for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext, and the acquisitions of NYSE Liffe US and NYSE Amex. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency impact as a result of the weakening pound sterling (local currency of NYSE Liffe) versus the U.S. dollar. 65 Table of Contents Listing. For the year ended December 31, 2008, listing fees were $395 million, an increase of $10 million from the comparable period in 2007, primarily due to the inclusion of Euronext for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext. Market Data. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, market data revenue increased $58 million to $429 million, primarily due to higher subscriptions and price increase in Europe, as well as the inclusion of Euronexts results for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext. Market data revenues within U.S. Operations were $215 million, a decrease of $10 million from the comparable period a year ago, reflecting a decline in our market share of trading in Tape A securities. Other. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, other revenues decreased $46 million, or 12%, to $344 million. The decrease was primarily due to the lower regulatory revenues as a result of the FINRA divestiture and regulatory pricing changes. Offsetting these decreases were higher software revenues mainly as a result of the acquisition of Wombat and AEMS.

Section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the U.S. government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. NYSE Euronext, in turn, collects activity assessment fees from member organizations executing trades on the NYSE and NYSE Arca. The decrease in Section 31 fees for the year ended December 31, 2008 was due to a 63% decline in the SEC rate collected and subsequently paid as compared to the same period a year ago. Liquidity Payments. For the year ended December 31, 2008, liquidity payments were $1,292 million, an increase of $563 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition to the contribution of European Operations for the full year in 2008, the increase in U.S. Operations reflects (i) increased handled trading volume on the NYSE Arca platform, including the implementation on NYSE Arca, Inc. of an industry wide pilot program for trading designated option contracts in penny increments, which resulted in increased trading volumes, and (ii) pricing and rebate changes implemented during the fourth quarter 2007 and throughout 2008. Routing and Clearing. For the year ended December 31, 2008, routing and clearing fees were $300 million, an increase of $78 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily due to new and increased amount of routing costs incurred as a result of order flow being routed to other market centers. Impairment charges. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded impairment charges of $1,590 million primarily in connection with the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets in our European Operations to their estimated fair value. 66 Table of Contents Other Operating Expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2008, other operating expenses were $1,883 million, an increase of $301 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of results of Euronext for the full year 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, and incremental merger expenses and exit costs following the implementation of cost containment initiatives. Regulatory Fine Income For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, regulatory fine income decreased $27 million to $3 million. Regulatory fines result from actions taken by NYSE Regulation in its oversight of NYSE and NYSE Arca member organizations and, accordingly, may vary period over period. Regulatory fine income was expected to decrease as a result of the transfer of certain functions previously carried out by NYSE Regulation to FINRA effective July 30, 2007. Non operating components of our results of operations were as follows: Interest Expense Interest expense is primarily attributable to the debt incurred to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid to Euronext shareholders in April 2007 as well as debt incurred as part of subsequent transactions. The $21 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to the fact that our debt was outstanding for the full year in 2008 as compared to 2007 when we only started incurring meaningful debt in April following the merger transaction with Euronext. In addition, in the second quarter of 2008, we issued $750 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 750 million ($1,181 million) of fixed rate bonds due in June 2015 in order to, among other things, refinance outstanding commercial paper and lengthen the maturity profile of our debt. These bonds bear interest at fixed rates per annum which are higher than the floating rate on commercial paper for the period. Interest and Investment Income The decrease in the average balance of cash and financial investments, fluctuation of interest rates and general market conditions were the primary drivers of the decrease in interest and investment income. Gain on Sale of Equity Investment and Businesses For the year ended December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext recorded a $4 million gain on sale of equity investment primarily related to Powernext and Endex. For the year ended December 31, 2007, gain on sale of equity investment was $33 million primarily reflecting the sale of the member firm regulatory functions of NYSE Regulation to FINRA. Income from Associates Income from associates reflects NYSE Euronext pro rata share in earnings of equity method investments, primarily AEMS up until the August 5, 2008 acquisition of the remaining 50% stake previously owned by Atos Origin. Subsequent to the acquisition, the results of AEMS have been fully consolidated in our results of operations. Other Income For the year ended December 31, 2008, other income of $37 million primarily reflected foreign exchange and other one time gains. Minority Interest For the year ended December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext recorded minority interest of $5 million primarily representing 2.3% of the Euronext N.V. income for the period from January 1, 2008 to May 20, 2008 (the effective date of the statutory buy out of the remaining minority Euronext shareholders). 67 Table of Contents Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext provided for income taxes at an estimated tax rate of (15)%. Our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to foreign operations and the non deductability of goodwill impairment charges. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the consolidated effective tax rate was 27% which reflected foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. Included in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2007 was a deferred tax benefit of $55 million related to an enacted reduction of the corporate tax rate from 30% to 28% in the United Kingdom.

This compares to revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), operating income from continuing operations and net income of $1,703 million, $234 million and $205 million, respectively. The $1,679 million increase in revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), $645 million increase in operating income from continuing operations and $438 million increase in net income for the period reflect the following principal factors: Increased revenues Euronexts results of operations were consolidated following the April 4, 2007 combination with NYSE Group and contributed revenues of $1,191 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was the primary driver of the period over period increase. Higher U.S. trading volumes also contributed to increased revenues, as well as increased liquidity payment and routing and clearing expenses, which partially offset increased revenues for the period. Increased operating income from continuing operations The period over period increase in operating income of $645 million was the result of Euronexts contribution to operating income of $530 million, as well as other revenue growth and overall operating efficiencies as we realize merger synergies. Improved net income Period over period, net income increased $438 million, which was primarily impacted by the consolidation of Euronext, revenue growth and overall operating efficiencies.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, U.S. Operations contributed $1,165 million to NYSE Euronexts cash trading revenues, a $520 million increase as compared to December 31, 2006. The primary drivers of this increase (and their corresponding contributions) were pricing structure changes that were implemented for part of 2006 and for the full period in 2007 on both the NYSE and NYSE Arca (approximately $292 million), increased trading volume (approximately $139 million), and the inclusion of the results of NYSE Arca for the full year 2007 (approximately $89 million). European Operations contributed $410 million in revenues, reflecting the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext, in addition to increased trading volumes due to positive structural trading trends (such as the high frequency of algorithmic trading) and increased market volatility. Derivatives trading. For the year ended December 31, 2007, derivatives trading revenues increased by $630 million from the comparable period in 2006 to $661 million, primarily reflecting the impact of Euronexts business subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext as well as increased market volatility resulting in increased trading volumes both in the U.S. and in Europe. 69 Table of Contents Listing. For the year ended December 31, 2007, listing fees were $385 million, an increase of $29 million from the comparable period in 2006, primarily reflecting the impact of Euronexts business subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext, and an increase in aggregate shares billed for annual fees by U.S. Operations. Market data. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, market data revenue increased $148 million to $371 million, primarily reflecting the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext. Other. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, other revenues decreased $58 million, or 13%, to $390 million. The decrease was primarily due to (i) a $32 million decrease in U.S. Operations regulatory revenue as a result of the completion of the sale of the member firm regulatory functions of NYSE Regulation to FINRA in July 2007, (ii) a $37 million decrease in U.S. Operations software and technology services revenue primarily as a result of a reduction in the amount of services provided by SIAC to its customers, and (iii) a $27 million decrease in U.S. Operations other revenue as a result of the discontinuation of the specialists trading privilege fee in December 2006 and the overall decrease of traders on the NYSEs trading floor. These decreases were partially offset by the European Operations as the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 combination of the businesses of NYSE Group and Euronext.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, liquidity payments were $729 million, an increase of $464 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase reflects (i) changes in the NYSEs pricing structure implemented during December 2006 that included a fixed monthly specialist rebate (representing approximately $92 million), coupled with increased trading volumes on our U.S. cash markets (representing approximately $205 million), (ii) the implementation on NYSE Arca, Inc. of an industry wide pilot program for trading designated options contracts in penny increments, which resulted in increased trading volumes on which liquidity payments were made (representing approximately $20 million), (iii) the inclusion of the results of NYSE Arca for the full year 2007 (representing approximately $44 million), (iv) the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext and (v) increased trading volatility in the European derivatives markets. Routing and Clearing. For the year ended December 31, 2007, routing and clearing fees were $222 million, an increase of $148 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to new and increased amount of routing costs incurred as a result of higher trading volume and order flow being routed to other market centers (representing approximately $133 million) and the inclusion of the results of NYSE Arca for the full year 2007 (representing approximately $15 million). Other Operating Expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2007, other operating expenses were $1,582 million, an increase of $416 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily related to systems and communications ($144 million), depreciation and amortization ($104 million), marketing 70 Table of Contents and other ($69 million), compensation ($54 million), and all others ($45 million). The driver of the increase was primarily as a result of the impact of European Operations, reflecting the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext. Regulatory Fine Income For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, regulatory fine income decreased $6 million to $30 million reflecting, in part, the impact of the creation of FINRA in July 2007 and the transfer to it of certain regulatory functions of NYSE Regulation. Regulatory fines result from actions taken by NYSE Regulation in its oversight of NYSE and NYSE Arca member organizations and, accordingly, may vary period over period. Regulatory fine income will continue to decrease in future periods following the creation of FINRA. Non operating components of our results of operations were as follows: Interest Expense The significant increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the debt incurred to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid to Euronext shareholders in April 2007. Interest and Investment Income Consolidation of interest and investment income from Euronext and the favorable impact of rising interest rates on cash, cash equivalents and financial investments were the primary factors in the $25 million increase in interest and investment income. Gain on Sale of Equity Investment and Businesses For the year ended December 31, 2007, NYSE Euronext recorded a $32 million gain on the sale of the member firm regulatory functions of NYSE Regulation to FINRA. Income from Associates Income from associates reflects NYSE Euronext pro rata share in earnings of equity method investments, including AEMS, MTS (through its disposition on September 14, 2007) and Powernext. Other Income For the year ended December 31, 2007, other income of $30 million primarily reflected the receipt of insurance reimbursements, which may vary period over period. Minority Interest For the year ended December 31, 2007, NYSE Euronext recorded minority interest of $10 million primarily representing 2.32% of the Euronext income for the period, which corresponds to the percentage of voting rights that were not tendered during the initial exchange offer period. During the comparable period in 2006, NYSE Euronext recorded minority interest until November 1, 2006 when it purchased the one third ownership stake in SIAC previously held by NYSE Amex. Income Taxes The consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 27% which reflects foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. Included in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2007 was a deferred tax benefit of $55 million related to an enacted reduction of the corporate tax rate from 30% to 28% in the United Kingdom. For the year ended December 31, 2006, NYSE Euronexts effective rate was 37%, lower than the statutory rate primarily as a result of federal and state tax credits. 71 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources NYSE Euronexts financial policy seeks to finance the growth of its business, remunerate shareholders and ensure financial flexibility, while maintaining strong creditworthiness and liquidity. NYSE Euronexts primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, current assets and existing bank facilities. NYSE Euronexts principal liquidity requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate use. Cash Flows From Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $721 million. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $376 million. Under the terms of the operating agreement of the NYSE, no regulatory fees, fines or penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be distributed to NYSE Euronext or any entity other than NYSE Regulation. As a result, the use of regulatory fees, fines and penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be considered restricted. As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext did not have significant restricted cash balances. Net Financial Indebtedness As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext had approximately $3.1 billion in debt outstanding and $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and financial investments, resulting in $2.1 billion in net indebtedness. We define net indebtedness as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents and financial investments. Net indebtedness was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 777 $ 934 Current investments 236 557 Securities purchased under agreements to resell 9 Cash, cash equivalents and financial investments 1,013 1,500 Short term debt 1,350 2,164 Long term debt 1,787 494 Total debt 3,137 2,658 Net indebtedness $ 2,124 $ 1,158 Cash, cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronexts main debt instruments were as follows (in millions): Principal amount Maturity Commercial paper issued under the global commercial paper program $692 From January 2, 2009until March 16, 2009 Bond in sterling &pound;250($365) June 16, 2009 4.8% bond in U.S. dollar $750 June 30, 2013 5.375% bond in Euro 750($1,044) June 30, 2015 Bank overdraft $249 72 Table of Contents The &pound;250 million ($365 million) fixed rate bonds were issued in 2004 to refinance the acquisition of LIFFE (Holdings) plc by Euronext and were swapped to floating rate using a fixed to floating rate swap. As of December 31, 2008, taking into account this swap, the effective interest rate on the bonds was 3.3%. The bonds mature in June 2009. In 2007, NYSE Euronext entered into a U.S. dollar and euro denominated global commercial paper program of $3.0 billion in order to refinance the acquisition of the Euronext shares. As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext had $0.7 billion of debt outstanding at an average interest rate of 2.9% under this commercial paper program. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (Libor U.S. for commercial paper issued in U.S. dollar and Euribor for commercial paper issued in euro). The fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may therefore impact the interest expense incurred by NYSE Euronext. The commercial paper program is backed by a $2.0 billion 5 year syndicated revolving bank facility maturing on April 4, 2012 and a $1.0 billion 364 day syndicated revolving bank facility maturing on April 1, 2009. These bank facilities are also available for general corporate purposes and were not drawn as of December 31, 2008. On September 15, 2008, the amount of commitments readily available to NYSE Euronext under the $2.0 billion April 2012 facility decreased from $2.0 billion to $1,833 million as a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which had provided a $167 million commitment under this facility. In August 2006, prior to the combination with NYSE Group, Euronext entered into a 300 million ($418 million) revolving credit facility available for general corporate purposes, which matures on August 4, 2011. On a combined basis, as of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext had three committed bank credit facilities totaling $3.2 billion, with no amount outstanding under any of these facilities. The commercial paper program and the credit facilities include terms and conditions customary for agreements of this type, which may restrict NYSE Euronexts ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness. In the second quarter of 2008, NYSE Euronext issued $750 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 750 million ($1,181 million) of fixed rate bonds due in June 2015 in order to, among other things, refinance outstanding commercial paper and lengthen the maturity profile of its debt. These bonds bear interest at a rate per annum of 4.8% and 5.375%, respectively. The terms of the bonds do not contain any financial covenants. The bonds may be redeemed by NYSE Euronext or the bond holders under certain customary circumstances, including a change in control. The terms of the bonds also provide for customary events of default and a negative pledge covenant. Liquidity Risk NYSE Euronext continually reviews its liquidity and debt positions, and subject to market conditions and credit and strategic considerations, may from time to time determine to vary the maturity profile of its debt and diversify its sources of financing. NYSE Euronext anticipates being able to support short term liquidity and operating needs primarily through existing cash balances and financing arrangements, along with future cash flows from operations. If existing financing arrangements are insufficient to meet anticipated needs or to refinance existing debt, NYSE Euronext may seek additional financing in either the debt or equity markets. NYSE Euronext may also seek equity or debt financing in connection with future acquisitions or other strategic transactions. While we believe that we generally have access to debt markets, including bank facilities and publicly and privately issued long and short term debt, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. The commercial paper market experienced disruptions in the second half of 2008. Because new issues of commercial paper generally fund the retirement of outstanding issues, NYSE Euronext is also exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to refinance outstanding commercial paper. In order to mitigate the rollover risk, NYSE Euronext maintains backstop bank facilities for an aggregate amount exceeding at any time the amount issued under its commercial paper program. In the event of severe disruptions in the commercial paper market, NYSE Euronext would have the ability to draw on these backstop facilities. 73 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Program The board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of NYSE Euronext common stock. Subsequent to the October 1, 2008 acquisition of NYSE Amex, NYSE Euronext commenced repurchases under this authorization, and NYSE Euronext plans to repurchase stock from time to time at the discretion of management in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to applicable U.S. and European laws, regulations and approvals, strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors. As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext had repurchased 13.4 million shares at an average price of $26.04 per share. Under SEC rules, NYSE Euronext will not be able to repurchase shares during certain restricted time periods. Dividends In June 2007, the board of directors declared an annual cash dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock, payable on a quarterly basis. Quarterly dividends of $0.25 per share were paid on July 13, 2007, December 28, 2007 and March 31, 2008. In March 2008, the board of directors approved an increase in NYSE Euronexts annual dividend, to $1.20 per share of common stock. Quarterly dividends of $0.30 per share were paid on June 30, 2008, September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2008. A quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share is scheduled to be paid on March 31, 2009. On February 9, 2009, NYSE Euronext announced that its board of directors had determined to maintain NYSE Euronexts quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share through 2009. Summary Disclosures About Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes NYSE Euronexts debt and future minimum lease obligations on its operating leases as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): Payments due by year(1) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Debt (principal and accrued interest obligations) $3,137 $ 1,350 $ $ $ $ 748 $ 1,039 Debt (future interest obligations) 550 72 92 92 92 74 128 Operating lease obligations 648 121 109 74 66 54 224 Other commitments(2) 624 621 3 $4,959 $ 2,164 $ 204 $ 166 $ 158 $ 876 $ 1,391 (1) As of December 31, 2008, obligations under capital leases were not significant. NYSE Euronext also has obligations related to unrecognized tax positions, deferred compensation and other post retirement benefits. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined. See Notes 8 Pension and Other Benefit Programs, 10 Stock Based Compensation, and 15 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Including in 2009, $250 million for the acquisition of a 25% ownership interest in the Doha Securities Market and 260 million ($362 million) for NYSE Liffe Clearing. As previously announced, we are currently in discussions to restructure the equity investment portion of the transaction, which will likely reduce our ownership interest to 20% and our cost to $200 million, payable over several years. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following provides information about NYSE Euronexts critical accounting policies and estimates. Critical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially produce materially different results, assumptions and conditions. Revenue Recognition There are two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our exchanges listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate action. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company 74 Table of Contents initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are not applicable to companies when they list on the NYSE or NYSE Arca in the context of a transfer from another market. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares. Annual fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original listing fees are recognized on a straight line basis over their estimated service periods of 10 years for NYSE and Euronext, and 5 years for NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, NYSE Euronext, through Wombat, licenses software and provides software services which are accounted for in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, which involves significant judgment. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets NYSE Euronext reviews the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based upon estimated fair value of NYSE Euronexts reporting units. Should the review indicate that goodwill is impaired, NYSE Euronexts goodwill would be reduced by the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its fair value. NYSE Euronext reviews the useful life of its indefinite lived intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life categorization. In addition, the carrying value of NYSE Euronexts other intangible assets is reviewed by NYSE Euronext at least annually for impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the asset. For purposes of performing the impairment test, fair values are determined using discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which, among other factors, is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long term rate of growth for businesses, and determination of weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill and other intangible impairment for each reporting unit. Income Taxes NYSE Euronext records income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and tax bases in assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided for certain tax carryforwards. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. NYSE Euronext is subject to numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions primarily based on its operations in these jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in NYSE Euronexts financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could have material impact on NYSE Euronexts financial position or results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Employee Benefits Pension and Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with the U.S. 75 Table of Contents generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect NYSE Euronexts pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense. Hedging Activities NYSE Euronext uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. NYSE Euronext accounts for derivatives pursuant to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires that all derivatives be recorded at fair value on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in other comprehensive income or net income depending on whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in cash flows or changes in fair value. New Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)), requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to: (1) recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally at their acquisition date fair values; (2) record those assets and liabilities at their full fair value amounts even if there is noncontrolling (minority) interest; (3) include noncontrolling interest earnings through net income; (4) expense acquisition related transaction costs; and (5) disclose information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for NYSE Euronext for any acquisitions occurring in 2009 and years thereafter. SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No. 160), which is to be retrospectively applied, requires entities to include noncontrolling (minority) interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries within shareholders equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 also requires the consolidating entity to include the earnings of the consolidated subsidiary attributable to the noncontrolling interest holder in its income statement with an offsetting charge (credit) to the non controlling interest in shareholders equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective for NYSE Euronext beginning January 1, 2009. SFAS No. 161, Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS No. 161) is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entitys derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 applies to all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133. It also applies to non derivative hedging instruments and all hedged items designated and qualifying as hedges under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 161 amends the current qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities set forth in SFAS No. 133 and generally increases the level of disaggregation that will be required in an entitys financial statements. SFAS No. 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS No. 161 is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. 76 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK General As a result of its operating and financing activities, NYSE Euronext is exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, currency risk, credit risk and equity risk. NYSE Euronext has implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. NYSE Euronexts central treasury is charged with identifying risk exposures and monitoring and managing such risks on a daily basis. To the extent allowed by local regulation and necessary, NYSE Euronexts subsidiaries centralize their cash investments, report their risks and hedge their exposures with the central treasury. NYSE Euronext performs sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have. NYSE Euronext uses derivative instruments solely to hedge financial risks related to its financial positions or risks that are otherwise incurred in the normal course of its commercial activities. It does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Most of NYSE Euronexts financial assets and liabilities are based on floating rates, on fixed rates with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in less than one year or on fixed rates that have been swapped to floating rates via fixed to floating rate swaps. The following table summarizes NYSE Euronexts exposure to interest rate risk as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): Financial assets Financialliabilities NetExposure Impact(2) of a100 bps adverseshift in interestrates(3) Floating rate(1) positions in Dollar 365 238 127 (1.3 ) Euro 304 745 (441 ) (4.4 ) Sterling 258 368 (4) (110 ) (1.1 ) Fixed rate positions in Dollar 1 748 (747 ) (28.9 ) Euro 1,039 (1,039 ) (51.7 ) Sterling (1) Includes floating rate, fixed rate with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in less than one year and fixed rate swapped to floating rate. (2) Impact on profit and loss for floating rate positions (cash flow risk) and on equity until realization in profit and loss for fixed rate positions (price risk). (3) 100 basis points parallel shift of yield curve. (4) Includes the effect of the fixed to floating interest rate swap on the &pound;250 million fixed rate bond issuance. In order to hedge interest rate exposures, NYSE Euronext may enter into interest rate derivative instruments, such as swaps, with counterparties that meet high creditworthiness and rating standards. At December 31, 2008, the only significant outstanding interest rate hedge was a fixed to floating rate swap hedging the &pound;250 million ($365 million) fixed rate bond issuance denominated in sterling. NYSE Euronext is exposed to price risk on its outstanding fixed rate positions. At December 31, 2008, fixed rate positions in U.S. dollar and in euro with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in more than one year amounted to $747 million and $1,039 million, respectively. A hypothetical shift of 1% in the U.S. dollar or in the euro interest rate curves would in the aggregate impact the fair value of these positions by $28.9 million and $51.7 million, respectively. 77 Table of Contents NYSE Euronext is exposed to cash flow risk on its floating rate positions. Because NYSE Euronext is a net lender in the U.S. dollar, when interest rates in the U.S. dollar decrease, NYSE Euronexts net interest and investment income decreases. Based on December 31, 2008 positions, a hypothetical 1% decrease in U.S. dollar rates would negatively impact annual income by $1.3 million. Because NYSE Euronext is a net borrower in euro and sterling, when interest rates in euro or sterling increase, NYSE Euronext net interest and investment income decreases. Based on December 31, 2008 positions, a hypothetical 1% increase in euro and sterling rates would negatively impact annual income by $4.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Currency Risk As an international group, NYSE Euronext is subject to currency translation risk. A significant part of NYSE Euronexts assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses is recorded in euro and sterling. Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. NYSE Euronexts exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the year ended December 31, 2008 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2008 Euro Sterling Average rate in the period $ 1.4708 $ 1.8526 Average rate in the same period one year before $ 1.3710 $ 2.0015 Foreign denominated percentage of Revenues 23% 14% Operating expenses (1) 15% 12% Operating income (1) 52% 21% Impact of the currency fluctuations (2) on Revenues $ 30.8 $ (76.3 ) Operating expenses (1) 22.8 (58.3 ) Operating income (1) 8.0 (19.0 ) (1) Excluding $1,590 million impairment charges recorded in 2008. (2) Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in the prior year. NYSE Euronexts exposure to net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions): December 31, 2008 Position in euros Position in sterling Assets 4,399 &pound; 2,730 of which goodwill 1,049 1,074 Liabilities 2,440 682 of which borrowings 1,279 252 Net currency position before hedging activities 1,959 2,048 Impact of hedging activities 40 Net currency position 1,959 &pound; 2,088 Impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates $ (273 ) $ (305 ) 78 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext was exposed to net exposures in euro and sterling of 2.0 billion ($2.7 billion) and &pound;2.1 billion ($3.1 billion), respectively. NYSE Euronexts borrowings in euro and sterling of 1.3 billion ($1.8 billion) and &pound;0.3 billion ($0.4 billion), respectively, constitute a partial hedge of NYSE Euronexts net investments in foreign entities. As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext also had a &pound;40 million ($61 million) sterling/dollar foreign exchange swap outstanding. This swap matured in January 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value of this swap was a $2.7 million liability. Based on December 31, 2008 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of the euro against the dollar would negatively impact NYSE Euronexts equity by $273 million and a hypothetical 10% decrease of the sterling against the dollar would negatively impact NYSE Euronexts equity by $305 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of $1.4 billion on NYSE Euronexts consolidated equity. Credit Risk NYSE Euronext is exposed to credit risk in the event of a counterparty default. NYSE Euronext limits its exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which it makes investments and executes agreements. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. NYSE Euronexts investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. NYSE Euronext seeks to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties. An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, NYSE Euronexts policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk. Derivatives are negotiated with highly rated banks. 79 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements. Actual results may differ from such forward looking statements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. Certain prior period amounts presented in the discussion and analysis have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Overview NYSE Euronext was formed from the combination of the businesses of NYSE Group and Euronext, which was consummated on April 4, 2007. Prior to that date, NYSE Euronext had no significant assets and did not conduct any material activities other than those incidental to its formation. Following consummation of the combination, NYSE Euronext became the parent company of NYSE Group and Euronext and each of their respective subsidiaries. Under the purchase method of accounting, NYSE Group was treated as the accounting and legal acquiror in the combination with Euronext. On October 1, 2008, NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of The Amex Membership Corporation, including its subsidiary the American Stock Exchange, which is now known as NYSE Amex. NYSE Euronext evaluates segment performance primarily based on operating income. Following the combination of the businesses of NYSE Group and Euronext, NYSE Euronext operates under two reportable segments: U.S. Operations and European Operations. U.S. Operations consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts U.S. markets: obtaining new listings and servicing existing listings, providing access to trade execution in cash equities and options, selling market data and related information and distributing market information to data subscribers, issuing trading permits, providing data processing operations, providing regulatory services, and providing trading technology, software and connectivity to end users. European Operations consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts European markets: providing access to trade execution in all cash products as well as a wide range of derivatives products, providing listing services, selling market data and related information, providing transaction settlement and for the safe custody of physical securities, and providing electronic trading solutions as well as software and connectivity to end users. In January 2009, we created NYSE Technologies (NYXT) to combine the businesses formerly known as NYSE Euronext Advanced Trading Solutions (including NYSE TransactTools, Wombat, and AEMS) and our global market data businesses. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this organizational change on our segment reporting structure going forward. 55 Table of Contents Factors Affecting Our Results The business environment in which NYSE Euronext operates directly affects its results of operations. Our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors, including the level of trading activity in our markets, which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions, competition and market share, broad trends in the brokerage and finance industry, price levels and price volatility, the number and financial health of companies listed on NYSE Euronexts cash markets, changing technology in the financial services industry, and legislative and regulatory changes, among other factors. In particular, in recent years, the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings, the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors, market participants demand for speed, capacity and reliability, which requires continuing investment in technology, and increasing competition for market data revenues. For example, while total trading volumes have been increasing, the growth of our trading and market data revenues could be adversely impacted if we are unsuccessful in attracting additional volumes. The maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing. During 2008, there was turmoil in the economy and upheaval in the credit markets. Equity market indices declined throughout the year, with particularly sharp declines and higher volatility in September and October. Lower levels of economic activity and uncertainty regarding the capital markets can result in a decline in trading volume and deterioration of the economic welfare of our listed companies, which can adversely affect our revenues and future growth. Declines in volumes can also impact our market share and pricing structures. As a result of these economic and market changes, certain of our assets have been impaired. See Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Assets. These disruptions and developments have resulted in a range of actions by the U.S. and foreign governments to attempt to bring liquidity and order to the financial markets and to prevent a prolonged recession in the world economy. Securities and banking regulators have also been active in establishing temporary rules and regulations to respond to this crisis. Some of these actions have resulted in temporary or, in some cases, permanent, restrictions on certain types of securities transactions, most notably short sales of equity securities of certain financial institutions. We cannot predict whether these government efforts will be successful. Dislocation in the credit markets has led to increased liquidity risk. While we have not experienced reductions in our borrowing capacity, lenders in general have taken actions that indicate their concerns regarding liquidity in the marketplace. These actions have included reduced advance rates for certain security types, more stringent requirements for collateral eligibility and higher interest rates. Should lenders continue to take additional similar actions, the cost of conducting our business may increase and our ability to implement our business initiatives could be limited. We expect that all of these factors may have an impact on our businesses. Any potential growth in the global cash markets in the upcoming months will likely be tempered by investor uncertainty resulting from volatility in the cost of energy and commodities, unemployment and recession concerns, as well as the general state of the world economy. Recent Acquisitions AEMS On August 5, 2008, NYSE Euronext completed the acquisition of the 50% stake in AEMS previously owned by Atos Origin. Through the transaction, NYSE Euronext acquired (i) the NSC cash trading and LIFFE CONNECT derivatives trading platform technology, and all of the management and development services surrounding these platforms, (ii) AEMSs third party exchange technology business, and (iii) TRS/CPS, clearing software. The purchase price in the transaction was approximately 162 million ($255 million), net of approximately 120 million ($189 million) of cash acquired, and is subject to certain post closing adjustments. The results of operations and financial condition of AEMS have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the August 5, 2008 acquisition. Going forward, we have branded our technology business, including AEMS, as NYSE Technologies or NYXT. See Item 1 Business Technology. 56 Table of Contents NYSE Amex On October 1, 2008, NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of The Amex Membership Corporation. NYSE Euronext acquired the business of The Amex Membership Corporation, including its subsidiary the American Stock Exchange (now known as NYSE Amex). In the transaction, each holder of a regular membership of The Amex Membership Corporation became entitled to receive approximately 8,100 shares of NYSE Euronext common stock and each holder of an options principal membership became entitled to receive approximately 7,200 shares of NYSE Euronext common stock. A total of approximately 6.8 million shares of NYSE Euronext common stock were issued with a value of approximately $260 million. In addition, each former holder of a regular or options principal membership will be entitled to receive additional consideration calculated by reference to the net proceeds, if any, from the sale of the NYSE Amex headquarters in lower Manhattan, if such sale occurs within a specified period of time and certain conditions are satisfied. Other Transactions In 2008, we completed the statutory buy out of the remaining Euronext shareholders who held approximately 2.3% of the shares of Euronext N.V. and also completed the acquisition of Wombat, a privately held global leader in high performance financial market data management solutions. In addition, NYSE Liffe US, the new U.S. futures exchange of NYSE Euronext, received DCM status in August 2008 and began trading full and e mini gold and silver futures and options on futures contracts in September 2008. Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Assets Testing Methodology and Valuation Considerations Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable assets of a business acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142), we test goodwill of our reporting units (which is generally one level below our two reportable segments) and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. We perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter. The impairment test of goodwill is performed in two steps. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In determining the fair value of its reporting units in step one of the goodwill impairment test, we compute the present value of discounted cash flows and terminal value projected for the reporting unit. The rate used to discount cash flows represents the weighted average cost of capital that we believe is reflective of the relevant risk associated with the projected cash flows. To validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of the reporting units determined in step one of the goodwill impairment test to the market capitalization of NYSE Euronext to derive the implied control premium. In performing this reconciliation, we may, depending on the volatility of our stock price, use either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, generally 30 days. We compare the implied control premium to premiums paid in observable recent transactions of comparable companies to determine if the fair value of the reporting units estimated in step one of the goodwill impairment test is reasonable. 57 Table of Contents In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets (SFAS No. 144), impairment exists when the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from it. An intangible asset subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of the intangible asset, indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as, but not limited to, the reporting unit at which goodwill should be measured for impairment, future operating performance and cash flows, cost of capital, terminal values, control premiums, remaining economic lives of assets, and the allocation of shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, in order to determine whether a decline in the value of certain securities and other investments is other than temporary, and among other factors, we evaluate the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost. In particular, we consider the impact of duration and severity on the period of time expected for recovery to occur. If we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary, we write down the carrying value of the related asset to its estimated fair value. Results of Impairment Tests Based upon tests performed during the fourth quarter of 2008, NYSE Euronext recorded the following impairment charges (in millions): Goodwill $ 1,003 (1) Other intangible assets, net 522 (2) Other 65 (3) Total impairment charges $ 1,590 (1) For the goodwill allocated to our European Cash reporting unit. (2) For the national securities exchange registration of our European Cash reporting unit. (3) Includes impairment losses recorded in connection with our investment in BM&F Bovespa ($57 million) and other investments ($8 million). The impairment charges reflect current economic conditions, adverse equity market conditions which have caused a material decline in industry market multiples, and lower estimated future cash flows of our European Cash reporting unit as a result of increased competition which has caused a decline in our market share of cash trading in Europe as well as pricing pressures following the November 2007 introduction of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). Sources of Revenues Activity Assessment Our U.S. securities exchanges pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. These Section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. NYSE Group, in turn, collects activity assessment fees from member organizations executing trades on our U.S. securities exchanges, and recognizes these amounts when invoiced. 58 Table of Contents Fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and Section 31 fees do not have an impact on NYSE Euronexts net income. Cash Trading In our U.S. Operations, NYSE charges transaction fees for executing trades in NYSE listed equities on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, and NYSE Amex, as well as on orders that are routed to other market centers for execution. Changes to the pricing structure throughout 2007 and 2008 allowed further alignment of transaction revenue with executed volume. In our European Operations, Euronext generates cash trading revenue from fees charged primarily for the execution of trades of equity and debt securities and other cash instruments on Euronexts cash market, which is comprised of the separate cash markets operated in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris. Revenue from cash trading in any given period depends primarily on the number of shares traded on our U.S. securities exchanges, the number of trades executed on Euronext, and the fees charged for execution. The level of trading activity in any period is significantly influenced by a number of factors. See Factors Affecting Our Results. NYSE Euronexts cash trading pricing structures continue to be examined closely as part of a broad strategic review of NYSE Euronexts opportunities for revenue growth and efficiency improvement. As a result, we have and may continue to periodically modify our trading pricing structures. NYSE Euronext seeks to better capture value for the services it renders by aligning more closely transaction revenue with executed volume, product expansion and new product development. For example, effective October 1, 2008, we began offering a global pricing rebate to our European customers who exceed certain volume thresholds on each of our Euronext, NYSE and NYSE Arca trading platforms. Transaction fees that NYSE Euronext earns in the future could also continue to depend on the effect of certain regulations and rule changes, such as MiFID, which have the potential to impact the competitive environment in which NYSE Euronext operates. Derivatives Trading Revenue from derivatives trading consists of fixed per contract fees for executing trades of derivatives contracts on NYSE Liffe and executing options contracts traded on NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. In some cases, these fees are subject to caps. Revenues for fixed per contract fees are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract. The principal types of derivative contracts traded are equity and index products and short term interest rate products. Trading in equity products is primarily driven by price volatility in equity markets and indices and trading in short term interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from uncertainty over the direction of short term interest rates. The level of trading activity for all products is also influenced by market conditions and other factors. See Factors Affecting Our Results. Listings There are two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our U.S. and European securities exchanges listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate related actions. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are not applicable to companies that transfer to one of our U.S. securities exchanges from another listing venue. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be 59 Table of Contents listed, such as stock splits, rights issues, sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee. Annual fees in the U.S. are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of the listed company at the end of the prior year. Non U.S. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the United States. Annual fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original fees are recognized as income on a straight line basis over estimated service periods of ten years for the NYSE and the Euronext cash equities markets and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Listing fees for the Euronext subsidiaries comprise admission fees paid by issuers to list securities on the cash market, annual fees paid by companies whose financial instruments are listed on the cash market, and corporate activity and other fees, consisting primarily of fees charged by Euronext Paris for centralizing shares in IPOs and tender offers. Revenues from listing fees relate primarily to the number of shares outstanding. In general, Euronext has adopted a common set of listing fees for Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels and Euronext Lisbon. Under the harmonized fee book, domestic issuers (i.e., those from France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal) pay admission fees to list their securities based on the market capitalization of the respective issuer. Subsequent listings of securities receive a 50% discount on admission fees. Non domestic companies are charged admission and annual fees on a similar basis, although they are charged lower maximum admission fees and annual fees. Euronext Paris and Euronext Lisbon also charge centralization fees for collecting and allocating retail investor orders in IPOs and tender offers. The revenue NYSE Euronext derives from listing fees is primarily dependent on the number and size of new company listings and tender offers. The number and size of new company listings and tender offers in any period depend primarily on factors outside of NYSE Euronexts control, including general economic conditions in Europe and the United States (in particular, stock market conditions) and the success of competing stock exchanges in attracting and retaining listed companies. Market Data In our U.S. Operations we collect market data fees principally for consortium based data products, also known as core data products, and, to a lesser extent, for NYSE proprietary data products, also known as non core data products. Consortium based data fees are dictated as part of the securities industry plans. Consortium based data revenues from the dissemination of market data (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of a formula set by the SEC under Regulation NMS. Last sale prices and quotes in NYSE listed securities are disseminated through Tape A, which constitutes the majority of the NYSEs revenues from consortium based market data revenues. We also receive a share of the revenues from Tape B and Tape C, which represents data related to trading of certain securities that are listed on NYSE Arca, NYSE Amex, other regional exchanges and Nasdaq, respectively. These revenues are influenced by demand for the data by professional and nonprofessional subscribers. In addition, we receive fees for the display of data on television and for vendor access. Our proprietary products make market data available to subscribers covering activity that takes place solely on our U.S. markets, independent of activity on other markets. Our proprietary data products also include the sale of depth of book information, historical price information and corporate action information. The SEC approved a pilot program through March 31, 2009 for a new data product, NYSE Euronext Real Time Reference Prices, which allows Internet and media organizations to buy real time, last sale market data from NYSE and provide it broadly and free of charge to the public. CNBC, Google Finance and nyse.com are now displaying NYSE Real Time stock prices on their respective websites. In our European Operations we charge a variety of users, primarily the end users, for the use of real time market data services. We also collect annual license fees from vendors for the right to distribute market data to third parties and a service fee from vendors for direct connection to market data. A substantial majority of our 60 Table of Contents European market data revenues is derived from monthly end user fees. We also derive revenues from selling historical and reference data about securities, and by publishing the daily official lists for the Euronext markets. The principal drivers of market data revenues are the number of end users and the prices for data packages. Other Revenues Other revenues include software and technology services and regulatory revenues, as well as trading license fees and other fees, fees for facilities and other services provided to specialists, brokers and clerks physically located on the floors of our U.S. markets that enable them to engage in the purchase and sale of securities on the trading floor, and fees for clearance and settlement activities in our European Operations. Software and Technology Services. We generate revenues from connectivity services related to the SFTI network, software license and maintenance fees, and strategic consulting services. Customers pay to gain access to SFTI market centers via direct circuit to a SFTI access point or through a third party service bureau or extranet provider. SFTI revenue typically includes a connection fee and monthly recurring revenue based on a customers connection bandwidth. Hardware co location services are also offered at SFTI data centers, and customers typically sign multi year contracts. Co location revenue is recognized monthly over the life of the contract. Revenue is also earned from sales of our enterprise software platform, which provides low latency messaging and trade lifecycle management. Software license revenue is recorded at the time of sale, and maintenance contracts are recognized monthly over the life of the maintenance term. Unrealized portions of invoiced maintenance fees are recorded as deferred revenue. Expert consulting services are offered for customization or installation of the software and for general advisory services. Consulting revenue is generally billed in arrears on a time and materials basis, although customers sometimes prepay for blocks of consulting services in bulk. Prepaid consulting revenue is booked as deferred revenue until the services are rendered. We also generate revenues from software license contracts and maintenance agreements. We provide software which allows customers to receive comprehensive market agnostic connectivity, transaction and data management solutions. Software license revenues are recognized at the time of client acceptance and maintenance agreements revenues are recognized monthly over the life of the maintenance term subsequent to acceptance. Regulatory. Regulatory fees are charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges. Components of Expenses Section 31 Fees See Sources of Revenues Activity Assessment above. Liquidity Payments To attract order flow, enhance liquidity and promote use of our markets, we offer our customers a variety of liquidity payment structures, tailored to specific market, product and customer characteristics. For example, on the NYSE, we provide liquidity payments to DMMs for their role in the revenue we earn under the Regulation NMS formula for quoting the most attractive bid and offer prices in an NMS security. Other liquidity payments include liquidity provider incentive schemes, strategy rebates, block trades and other volume related discounts, reductions to or waivers of transaction fees, a contribution to information technology and staff costs incurred in providing the services and or a share of net transaction fees. Routing and Clearing We incur routing charges in the United States when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our U.S. securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customers order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center 61 Table of Contents charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. Also, NYSE Arca incurs clearance, brokerage and related transaction expenses, which primarily include costs incurred in self clearing activities, service fees paid per trade to exchanges for trade execution, and costs incurred due to erroneous trade execution. Impairment Charges Impairment charges include non cash charges recorded in connection with the write down of certain goodwill, indefinite lived intangible assets and other investments to their estimated fair value. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses include merger expenses and exit costs, compensation, systems and communications, professional services, depreciation and amortization, occupancy and marketing and other. Merger Expenses and Exit Costs Merger expenses and exit costs consist of severance costs and related curtailment losses, depreciation charges triggered by the acceleration of certain fixed asset useful lives, as well as legal and other expenses directly attributable to business combinations and cost reduction initiatives. Compensation Compensation expense includes employee salaries, incentive compensation (including stock based compensation) and related benefits expense, including pension, medical, post retirement medical and supplemental executive retirement plan charges. Part time help, primarily related to security personnel at the NYSE, is also recorded as part of compensation. Systems and Communications Systems and communications expense includes costs for development and maintenance of trading, regulatory and administrative systems; investments in system capacity, reliability and security; and costs of network connectivity between our customers and data centers, as well as connectivity to various other market centers. Systems and communications expense also includes fees paid to third party providers of networks and information technology resources, including fees for consulting, research and development services, software rental costs and licenses, hardware rental and related fees paid to third party maintenance providers. Until the August 2008 acquisition of the 50% stake in AEMS we did not already own, such expenses for Euronext consisted primarily of fees charged by AEMS for information technology services relating to the operation and maintenance of Euronexts cash and derivatives trading platforms, including license fees relating to NSC and LIFFE CONNECT. Following the acquisition of AEMS, we have in sourced our European technology and the results of AEMS have been consolidated in our results of operations. As such, the reduction in systems and communications expense is offset by increases in other components of expenses (including compensation, professional services and occupancy costs). Professional Services Professional services expense includes consulting charges related to various technological and operational initiatives, as well as legal and audit fees. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of costs from depreciating fixed assets (including computer hardware and capitalized software) and amortizing intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. 62 Table of Contents Occupancy Occupancy includes costs related to NYSE Euronexts leased premises, as well as real estate taxes and maintenance of owned premises. Marketing and Other Marketing and other expenses includes advertising, printing and promotion expenses, insurance premiums, travel and entertainment expenses, co branding, investor education and advertising expenses with NYSE listed companies as well as general and administrative expenses. Regulatory Fine Income Regulatory fine income, which we include in our operating income, is generated from fines levied by NYSE Regulation, which regulates and monitors trading on our U.S. securities exchanges. The frequency with which fines may be levied and their amount will vary based upon the actions of participants on our U.S. securities exchanges. Regulatory fines are used only for regulatory purposes. Results of Operations For the year ended December 31, 2008, the results of operations of NYSE Euronext included the results of operations of Wombat, AEMS and NYSE Amex since their respective dates of acquisition (March 7, 2008, August 5, 2008 and October 1, 2008, respectively). For the year ended December 31, 2007, the results of operations of NYSE Euronext included the results of NYSE Group for the full period and the results of operations of Euronext since April 4, 2007, the date that the combination of NYSE Group and Euronext was consummated. For the comparable period in 2006, the results of operations of NYSE Euronext only included the results of NYSE Group. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the results of operations of NYSE Group included the results of operations of NYSE Arca since March 7, 2006, the date the merger of NYSE and Archipelago was consummated. The operations of GL Trade, which were sold on October 1, 2008, are reflected as discontinued. 63 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2008 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2007 The following table sets forth NYSE Euronexts consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each item for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2007.

This compares to revenues (excluding activity assessment fees) of $3,382 million, operating income from continuing operations of $879 million and net income of $643 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The $1,092 million increase in revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), $(1,467) million decrease in operating income from continuing operations and $(1,381) million decrease in net income for the period reflect the following principal factors: Increased revenues The period over period increase of $1,092 million in revenues reflects primarily the inclusion of Euronexts results for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE 64 Table of Contents Group and Euronext. Higher trading volumes primarily in the U.S. cash markets and price changes also contributed to the increase in revenues. Higher trading volume increased liquidity payment and routing and clearing expenses, which partially offset increased revenues for the period. Operating (loss) income from continuing operations The period over period decrease in operating income of $(1,467) million was primarily due to impairment charges, higher liquidity payments on higher trading volumes, incremental merger expenses and exit costs as we continue to integrate our businesses, partially offset by revenue growth primarily in cash and derivatives markets. Net (loss) income The period over period decrease in net income of $(1,381) million was primarily due to impairment charges, higher liquidity payments associated with higher trading volumes, incremental merger expenses and exit costs, partially offset by revenue growth primarily in cash and derivatives markets.

Activity assessment fees are collected from member organizations executing trades on US markets. The decrease in activity assessment fees was mainly due to a 63% decline in the related SEC rate. Cash Trading. For the year ended December 31, 2008, U.S. Operations contributed $1,759 million to NYSE Euronexts cash trading revenues, a $594 million increase as compared to December 31, 2007. The primary drivers for this increase were increased handled trading volume on the NYSE Arca platforms and pricing changes on both the NYSE and NYSE Arca trading platforms. European Operations contributed $628 million in cash trading revenues as a result of the inclusion of Euronext for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext, higher trading volumes and favorable currency impact as a result of the strengthening of the Euro versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by price reductions due to the implementation of Pack Epsilon and other pricing changes. Derivatives Trading. For the year ended December 31, 2008, derivatives trading revenues increased by $258 million from the comparable period in 2007 to $919 million, primarily reflecting higher trading volumes, the inclusion of Euronexts results for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext, and the acquisitions of NYSE Liffe US and NYSE Amex. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency impact as a result of the weakening pound sterling (local currency of NYSE Liffe) versus the U.S. dollar. 65 Table of Contents Listing. For the year ended December 31, 2008, listing fees were $395 million, an increase of $10 million from the comparable period in 2007, primarily due to the inclusion of Euronext for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext. Market Data. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, market data revenue increased $58 million to $429 million, primarily due to higher subscriptions and price increase in Europe, as well as the inclusion of Euronexts results for the full year in 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago, which only included the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext. Market data revenues within U.S. Operations were $215 million, a decrease of $10 million from the comparable period a year ago, reflecting a decline in our market share of trading in Tape A securities. Other. For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, other revenues decreased $46 million, or 12%, to $344 million. The decrease was primarily due to the lower regulatory revenues as a result of the FINRA divestiture and regulatory pricing changes. Offsetting these decreases were higher software revenues mainly as a result of the acquisition of Wombat and AEMS.

Section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the U.S. government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. NYSE Euronext, in turn, collects activity assessment fees from member organizations executing trades on the NYSE and NYSE Arca. The decrease in Section 31 fees for the year ended December 31, 2008 was due to a 63% decline in the SEC rate collected and subsequently paid as compared to the same period a year ago. Liquidity Payments. For the year ended December 31, 2008, liquidity payments were $1,292 million, an increase of $563 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition to the contribution of European Operations for the full year in 2008, the increase in U.S. Operations reflects (i) increased handled trading volume on the NYSE Arca platform, including the implementation on NYSE Arca, Inc. of an industry wide pilot program for trading designated option contracts in penny increments, which resulted in increased trading volumes, and (ii) pricing and rebate changes implemented during the fourth quarter 2007 and throughout 2008. Routing and Clearing. For the year ended December 31, 2008, routing and clearing fees were $300 million, an increase of $78 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily due to new and increased amount of routing costs incurred as a result of order flow being routed to other market centers. Impairment charges. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded impairment charges of $1,590 million primarily in connection with the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets in our European Operations to their estimated fair value. 66 Table of Contents Other Operating Expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2008, other operating expenses were $1,883 million, an increase of $301 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of results of Euronext for the full year 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, and incremental merger expenses and exit costs following the implementation of cost containment initiatives. Regulatory Fine Income For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, regulatory fine income decreased $27 million to $3 million. Regulatory fines result from actions taken by NYSE Regulation in its oversight of NYSE and NYSE Arca member organizations and, accordingly, may vary period over period. Regulatory fine income was expected to decrease as a result of the transfer of certain functions previously carried out by NYSE Regulation to FINRA effective July 30, 2007. Non operating components of our results of operations were as follows: Interest Expense Interest expense is primarily attributable to the debt incurred to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid to Euronext shareholders in April 2007 as well as debt incurred as part of subsequent transactions. The $21 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to the fact that our debt was outstanding for the full year in 2008 as compared to 2007 when we only started incurring meaningful debt in April following the merger transaction with Euronext. In addition, in the second quarter of 2008, we issued $750 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 750 million ($1,181 million) of fixed rate bonds due in June 2015 in order to, among other things, refinance outstanding commercial paper and lengthen the maturity profile of our debt. These bonds bear interest at fixed rates per annum which are higher than the floating rate on commercial paper for the period. Interest and Investment Income The decrease in the average balance of cash and financial investments, fluctuation of interest rates and general market conditions were the primary drivers of the decrease in interest and investment income. Gain on Sale of Equity Investment and Businesses For the year ended December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext recorded a $4 million gain on sale of equity investment primarily related to Powernext and Endex. For the year ended December 31, 2007, gain on sale of equity investment was $33 million primarily reflecting the sale of the member firm regulatory functions of NYSE Regulation to FINRA. Income from Associates Income from associates reflects NYSE Euronext pro rata share in earnings of equity method investments, primarily AEMS up until the August 5, 2008 acquisition of the remaining 50% stake previously owned by Atos Origin. Subsequent to the acquisition, the results of AEMS have been fully consolidated in our results of operations. Other Income For the year ended December 31, 2008, other income of $37 million primarily reflected foreign exchange and other one time gains. Minority Interest For the year ended December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext recorded minority interest of $5 million primarily representing 2.3% of the Euronext N.V. income for the period from January 1, 2008 to May 20, 2008 (the effective date of the statutory buy out of the remaining minority Euronext shareholders). 67 Table of Contents Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext provided for income taxes at an estimated tax rate of (15)%. Our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to foreign operations and the non deductability of goodwill impairment charges. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the consolidated effective tax rate was 27% which reflected foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. Included in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2007 was a deferred tax benefit of $55 million related to an enacted reduction of the corporate tax rate from 30% to 28% in the United Kingdom. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2006 The following table sets forth NYSE Euronexts consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each item for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2006.

This compares to revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), operating income from continuing operations and net income of $1,703 million, $234 million and $205 million, respectively. The $1,679 million increase in revenues (excluding activity assessment fees), $645 million increase in operating income from continuing operations and $438 million increase in net income for the period reflect the following principal factors: Increased revenues Euronexts results of operations were consolidated following the April 4, 2007 combination with NYSE Group and contributed revenues of $1,191 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was the primary driver of the period over period increase. Higher U.S. trading volumes also contributed to increased revenues, as well as increased liquidity payment and routing and clearing expenses, which partially offset increased revenues for the period. Increased operating income from continuing operations The period over period increase in operating income of $645 million was the result of Euronexts contribution to operating income of $530 million, as well as other revenue growth and overall operating efficiencies as we realize merger synergies. Improved net income Period over period, net income increased $438 million, which was primarily impacted by the consolidation of Euronext, revenue growth and overall operating efficiencies.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, U.S. Operations contributed $1,165 million to NYSE Euronexts cash trading revenues, a $520 million increase as compared to December 31, 2006. The primary drivers of this increase (and their corresponding contributions) were pricing structure changes that were implemented for part of 2006 and for the full period in 2007 on both the NYSE and NYSE Arca (approximately $292 million), increased trading volume (approximately $139 million), and the inclusion of the results of NYSE Arca for the full year 2007 (approximately $89 million). European Operations contributed $410 million in revenues, reflecting the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext, in addition to increased trading volumes due to positive structural trading trends (such as the high frequency of algorithmic trading) and increased market volatility. Derivatives trading. For the year ended December 31, 2007, derivatives trading revenues increased by $630 million from the comparable period in 2006 to $661 million, primarily reflecting the impact of Euronexts business subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext as well as increased market volatility resulting in increased trading volumes both in the U.S. and in Europe. 69 Table of Contents Listing. For the year ended December 31, 2007, listing fees were $385 million, an increase of $29 million from the comparable period in 2006, primarily reflecting the impact of Euronexts business subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext, and an increase in aggregate shares billed for annual fees by U.S. Operations. Market data. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, market data revenue increased $148 million to $371 million, primarily reflecting the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext. Other. For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, other revenues decreased $58 million, or 13%, to $390 million. The decrease was primarily due to (i) a $32 million decrease in U.S. Operations regulatory revenue as a result of the completion of the sale of the member firm regulatory functions of NYSE Regulation to FINRA in July 2007, (ii) a $37 million decrease in U.S. Operations software and technology services revenue primarily as a result of a reduction in the amount of services provided by SIAC to its customers, and (iii) a $27 million decrease in U.S. Operations other revenue as a result of the discontinuation of the specialists trading privilege fee in December 2006 and the overall decrease of traders on the NYSEs trading floor. These decreases were partially offset by the European Operations as the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 combination of the businesses of NYSE Group and Euronext.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, liquidity payments were $729 million, an increase of $464 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase reflects (i) changes in the NYSEs pricing structure implemented during December 2006 that included a fixed monthly specialist rebate (representing approximately $92 million), coupled with increased trading volumes on our U.S. cash markets (representing approximately $205 million), (ii) the implementation on NYSE Arca, Inc. of an industry wide pilot program for trading designated options contracts in penny increments, which resulted in increased trading volumes on which liquidity payments were made (representing approximately $20 million), (iii) the inclusion of the results of NYSE Arca for the full year 2007 (representing approximately $44 million), (iv) the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext and (v) increased trading volatility in the European derivatives markets. Routing and Clearing. For the year ended December 31, 2007, routing and clearing fees were $222 million, an increase of $148 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to new and increased amount of routing costs incurred as a result of higher trading volume and order flow being routed to other market centers (representing approximately $133 million) and the inclusion of the results of NYSE Arca for the full year 2007 (representing approximately $15 million). Other Operating Expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2007, other operating expenses were $1,582 million, an increase of $416 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily related to systems and communications ($144 million), depreciation and amortization ($104 million), marketing 70 Table of Contents and other ($69 million), compensation ($54 million), and all others ($45 million). The driver of the increase was primarily as a result of the impact of European Operations, reflecting the results of Euronext subsequent to the April 4, 2007 merger between NYSE Group and Euronext. Regulatory Fine Income For the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, regulatory fine income decreased $6 million to $30 million reflecting, in part, the impact of the creation of FINRA in July 2007 and the transfer to it of certain regulatory functions of NYSE Regulation. Regulatory fines result from actions taken by NYSE Regulation in its oversight of NYSE and NYSE Arca member organizations and, accordingly, may vary period over period. Regulatory fine income will continue to decrease in future periods following the creation of FINRA. Non operating components of our results of operations were as follows: Interest Expense The significant increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the debt incurred to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid to Euronext shareholders in April 2007. Interest and Investment Income Consolidation of interest and investment income from Euronext and the favorable impact of rising interest rates on cash, cash equivalents and financial investments were the primary factors in the $25 million increase in interest and investment income. Gain on Sale of Equity Investment and Businesses For the year ended December 31, 2007, NYSE Euronext recorded a $32 million gain on the sale of the member firm regulatory functions of NYSE Regulation to FINRA. Income from Associates Income from associates reflects NYSE Euronext pro rata share in earnings of equity method investments, including AEMS, MTS (through its disposition on September 14, 2007) and Powernext. Other Income For the year ended December 31, 2007, other income of $30 million primarily reflected the receipt of insurance reimbursements, which may vary period over period. Minority Interest For the year ended December 31, 2007, NYSE Euronext recorded minority interest of $10 million primarily representing 2.32% of the Euronext income for the period, which corresponds to the percentage of voting rights that were not tendered during the initial exchange offer period. During the comparable period in 2006, NYSE Euronext recorded minority interest until November 1, 2006 when it purchased the one third ownership stake in SIAC previously held by NYSE Amex. Income Taxes The consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 27% which reflects foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. Included in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2007 was a deferred tax benefit of $55 million related to an enacted reduction of the corporate tax rate from 30% to 28% in the United Kingdom. For the year ended December 31, 2006, NYSE Euronexts effective rate was 37%, lower than the statutory rate primarily as a result of federal and state tax credits. 71 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources NYSE Euronexts financial policy seeks to finance the growth of its business, remunerate shareholders and ensure financial flexibility, while maintaining strong creditworthiness and liquidity. NYSE Euronexts primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, current assets and existing bank facilities. NYSE Euronexts principal liquidity requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate use. Cash Flows From Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $721 million. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $376 million. Under the terms of the operating agreement of the NYSE, no regulatory fees, fines or penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be distributed to NYSE Euronext or any entity other than NYSE Regulation. As a result, the use of regulatory fees, fines and penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be considered restricted. As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext did not have significant restricted cash balances. Net Financial Indebtedness As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext had approximately $3.1 billion in debt outstanding and $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and financial investments, resulting in $2.1 billion in net indebtedness. We define net indebtedness as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents and financial investments. Net indebtedness was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 777 $ 934 Current investments 236 557 Securities purchased under agreements to resell 9 Cash, cash equivalents and financial investments 1,013 1,500 Short term debt 1,350 2,164 Long term debt 1,787 494 Total debt 3,137 2,658 Net indebtedness $ 2,124 $ 1,158 Cash, cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronexts main debt instruments were as follows (in millions): Principal amount Maturity Commercial paper issued under the global commercial paper program $692 From January 2, 2009until March 16, 2009 Bond in sterling &pound;250($365) June 16, 2009 4.8% bond in U.S. dollar $750 June 30, 2013 5.375% bond in Euro 750($1,044) June 30, 2015 Bank overdraft $249 72 Table of Contents The &pound;250 million ($365 million) fixed rate bonds were issued in 2004 to refinance the acquisition of LIFFE (Holdings) plc by Euronext and were swapped to floating rate using a fixed to floating rate swap. As of December 31, 2008, taking into account this swap, the effective interest rate on the bonds was 3.3%. The bonds mature in June 2009. In 2007, NYSE Euronext entered into a U.S. dollar and euro denominated global commercial paper program of $3.0 billion in order to refinance the acquisition of the Euronext shares. As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext had $0.7 billion of debt outstanding at an average interest rate of 2.9% under this commercial paper program. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (Libor U.S. for commercial paper issued in U.S. dollar and Euribor for commercial paper issued in euro). The fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may therefore impact the interest expense incurred by NYSE Euronext. The commercial paper program is backed by a $2.0 billion 5 year syndicated revolving bank facility maturing on April 4, 2012 and a $1.0 billion 364 day syndicated revolving bank facility maturing on April 1, 2009. These bank facilities are also available for general corporate purposes and were not drawn as of December 31, 2008. On September 15, 2008, the amount of commitments readily available to NYSE Euronext under the $2.0 billion April 2012 facility decreased from $2.0 billion to $1,833 million as a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which had provided a $167 million commitment under this facility. In August 2006, prior to the combination with NYSE Group, Euronext entered into a 300 million ($418 million) revolving credit facility available for general corporate purposes, which matures on August 4, 2011. On a combined basis, as of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext had three committed bank credit facilities totaling $3.2 billion, with no amount outstanding under any of these facilities. The commercial paper program and the credit facilities include terms and conditions customary for agreements of this type, which may restrict NYSE Euronexts ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness. In the second quarter of 2008, NYSE Euronext issued $750 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 750 million ($1,181 million) of fixed rate bonds due in June 2015 in order to, among other things, refinance outstanding commercial paper and lengthen the maturity profile of its debt. These bonds bear interest at a rate per annum of 4.8% and 5.375%, respectively. The terms of the bonds do not contain any financial covenants. The bonds may be redeemed by NYSE Euronext or the bond holders under certain customary circumstances, including a change in control. The terms of the bonds also provide for customary events of default and a negative pledge covenant. Liquidity Risk NYSE Euronext continually reviews its liquidity and debt positions, and subject to market conditions and credit and strategic considerations, may from time to time determine to vary the maturity profile of its debt and diversify its sources of financing. NYSE Euronext anticipates being able to support short term liquidity and operating needs primarily through existing cash balances and financing arrangements, along with future cash flows from operations. If existing financing arrangements are insufficient to meet anticipated needs or to refinance existing debt, NYSE Euronext may seek additional financing in either the debt or equity markets. NYSE Euronext may also seek equity or debt financing in connection with future acquisitions or other strategic transactions. While we believe that we generally have access to debt markets, including bank facilities and publicly and privately issued long and short term debt, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. The commercial paper market experienced disruptions in the second half of 2008. Because new issues of commercial paper generally fund the retirement of outstanding issues, NYSE Euronext is also exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to refinance outstanding commercial paper. In order to mitigate the rollover risk, NYSE Euronext maintains backstop bank facilities for an aggregate amount exceeding at any time the amount issued under its commercial paper program. In the event of severe disruptions in the commercial paper market, NYSE Euronext would have the ability to draw on these backstop facilities. 73 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Program The board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of NYSE Euronext common stock. Subsequent to the October 1, 2008 acquisition of NYSE Amex, NYSE Euronext commenced repurchases under this authorization, and NYSE Euronext plans to repurchase stock from time to time at the discretion of management in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to applicable U.S. and European laws, regulations and approvals, strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors. As of December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext had repurchased 13.4 million shares at an average price of $26.04 per share. Under SEC rules, NYSE Euronext will not be able to repurchase shares during certain restricted time periods. Dividends In June 2007, the board of directors declared an annual cash dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock, payable on a quarterly basis. Quarterly dividends of $0.25 per share were paid on July 13, 2007, December 28, 2007 and March 31, 2008. In March 2008, the board of directors approved an increase in NYSE Euronexts annual dividend, to $1.20 per share of common stock. Quarterly dividends of $0.30 per share were paid on June 30, 2008, September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2008. A quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share is scheduled to be paid on March 31, 2009. On February 9, 2009, NYSE Euronext announced that its board of directors had determined to maintain NYSE Euronexts quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share through 2009. Summary Disclosures About Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes NYSE Euronexts debt and future minimum lease obligations on its operating leases as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): Payments due by year(1) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Debt (principal and accrued interest obligations) $3,137 $ 1,350 $ $ $ $ 748 $ 1,039 Debt (future interest obligations) 550 72 92 92 92 74 128 Operating lease obligations 648 121 109 74 66 54 224 Other commitments(2) 624 621 3 $4,959 $ 2,164 $ 204 $ 166 $ 158 $ 876 $ 1,391 (1) As of December 31, 2008, obligations under capital leases were not significant. NYSE Euronext also has obligations related to unrecognized tax positions, deferred compensation and other post retirement benefits. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined. See Notes 8 Pension and Other Benefit Programs, 10 Stock Based Compensation, and 15 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Including in 2009, $250 million for the acquisition of a 25% ownership interest in the Doha Securities Market and 260 million ($362 million) for NYSE Liffe Clearing. As previously announced, we are currently in discussions to restructure the equity investment portion of the transaction, which will likely reduce our ownership interest to 20% and our cost to $200 million, payable over several years. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following provides information about NYSE Euronexts critical accounting policies and estimates. Critical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially produce materially different results, assumptions and conditions. Revenue Recognition There are two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our exchanges listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate action. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company 74 Table of Contents initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are not applicable to companies when they list on the NYSE or NYSE Arca in the context of a transfer from another market. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares. Annual fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original listing fees are recognized on a straight line basis over their estimated service periods of 10 years for NYSE and Euronext, and 5 years for NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, NYSE Euronext, through Wombat, licenses software and provides software services which are accounted for in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, which involves significant judgment. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets NYSE Euronext reviews the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based upon estimated fair value of NYSE Euronexts reporting units. Should the review indicate that goodwill is impaired, NYSE Euronexts goodwill would be reduced by the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its fair value. NYSE Euronext reviews the useful life of its indefinite lived intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life categorization. In addition, the carrying value of NYSE Euronexts other intangible assets is reviewed by NYSE Euronext at least annually for impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the asset. For purposes of performing the impairment test, fair values are determined using discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which, among other factors, is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long term rate of growth for businesses, and determination of weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill and other intangible impairment for each reporting unit. Income Taxes NYSE Euronext records income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and tax bases in assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided for certain tax carryforwards. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. NYSE Euronext is subject to numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions primarily based on its operations in these jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in NYSE Euronexts financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could have material impact on NYSE Euronexts financial position or results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Employee Benefits Pension and Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with the U.S. 75 Table of Contents generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect NYSE Euronexts pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense. Hedging Activities NYSE Euronext uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. NYSE Euronext accounts for derivatives pursuant to SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires that all derivatives be recorded at fair value on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in other comprehensive income or net income depending on whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in cash flows or changes in fair value. New Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)), requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to: (1) recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally at their acquisition date fair values; (2) record those assets and liabilities at their full fair value amounts even if there is noncontrolling (minority) interest; (3) include noncontrolling interest earnings through net income; (4) expense acquisition related transaction costs; and (5) disclose information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for NYSE Euronext for any acquisitions occurring in 2009 and years thereafter. SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No. 160), which is to be retrospectively applied, requires entities to include noncontrolling (minority) interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries within shareholders equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 also requires the consolidating entity to include the earnings of the consolidated subsidiary attributable to the noncontrolling interest holder in its income statement with an offsetting charge (credit) to the non controlling interest in shareholders equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective for NYSE Euronext beginning January 1, 2009. SFAS No. 161, Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS No. 161) is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entitys derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 applies to all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133. It also applies to non derivative hedging instruments and all hedged items designated and qualifying as hedges under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 161 amends the current qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities set forth in SFAS No. 133 and generally increases the level of disaggregation that will be required in an entitys financial statements. SFAS No. 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS No. 161 is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. 76 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK General As a result of its operating and financing activities, NYSE Euronext is exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, currency risk, credit risk and equity risk. NYSE Euronext has implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. NYSE Euronexts central treasury is charged with identifying risk exposures and monitoring and managing such risks on a daily basis. To the extent allowed by local regulation and necessary, NYSE Euronexts subsidiaries centralize their cash investments, report their risks and hedge their exposures with the central treasury. NYSE Euronext performs sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have. NYSE Euronext uses derivative instruments solely to hedge financial risks related to its financial positions or risks that are otherwise incurred in the normal course of its commercial activities.

In order to hedge interest rate exposures, NYSE Euronext may enter into interest rate derivative instruments, such as swaps, with counterparties that meet high creditworthiness and rating standards. At December 31, 2008, the only significant outstanding interest rate hedge was a fixed to floating rate swap hedging the &pound;250 million ($365 million) fixed rate bond issuance denominated in sterling. NYSE Euronext is exposed to price risk on its outstanding fixed rate positions. At December 31, 2008, fixed rate positions in U.S. dollar and in euro with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in more than one year amounted to $747 million and $1,039 million, respectively. A hypothetical shift of 1% in the U.S. dollar or in the euro interest rate curves would in the aggregate impact the fair value of these positions by $28.9 million and $51.7 million, respectively. 77 Table of Contents NYSE Euronext is exposed to cash flow risk on its floating rate positions. Because NYSE Euronext is a net lender in the U.S. dollar, when interest rates in the U.S. dollar decrease, NYSE Euronexts net interest and investment income decreases. Based on December 31, 2008 positions, a hypothetical 1% decrease in U.S. dollar rates would negatively impact annual income by $1.3 million. Because NYSE Euronext is a net borrower in euro and sterling, when interest rates in euro or sterling increase, NYSE Euronext net interest and investment income decreases. Based on December 31, 2008 positions, a hypothetical 1% increase in euro and sterling rates would negatively impact annual income by $4.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

Credit Risk NYSE Euronext is exposed to credit risk in the event of a counterparty default. NYSE Euronext limits its exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which it makes investments and executes agreements. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. NYSE Euronexts investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. NYSE Euronext seeks to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties. An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, NYSE Euronexts policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk. Derivatives are negotiated with highly rated banks. 79 Table of Contents
