This charge reflected adverse economic and equity market conditions which caused a material decline in industry market multiples, and lower estimated future cash flows of our European reporting unit within our Cash Trading and Listings business segment as a result of increased competition which has caused a decline in our market share of cash trading in Europe as well as pricing pressures following the November 2007 introduction of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). (2) The operations of GL Trade, which were sold on October 1, 2008, are reflected as discontinued. (3) Represents liabilities due after one year, including deferred income taxes, accrued employee benefits, and deferred revenue. 46 Table of Contents Selected Operating Data The following tables present selected operating data for the periods presented.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements. Actual results may differ from such forward looking statements. See Item 1A Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. Certain prior period amounts presented in the discussion and analysis have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Overview NYSE Euronext was formed from the combination of the businesses of NYSE Group and Euronext, which was consummated on April 4, 2007. Following consummation of the combination, NYSE Euronext became the parent company of NYSE Group and Euronext and each of their respective subsidiaries. Under the purchase method of accounting, NYSE Group was treated as the accounting and legal acquirer in the combination with Euronext. On October 1, 2008, NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of The Amex Membership Corporation, including its subsidiary the American Stock Exchange, which is now known as NYSE Amex. NYSE Euronext operates under three reportable segments: Derivatives, Cash Trading and Listings, and Information Services and Technology Solutions. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on revenue and operating income. We have aggregated all of our corporate costs, including the costs to operate as a public company, within Corporate/ Eliminations. The following is a description of our reportable segments: Derivatives consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts global businesses: providing access to trade execution in derivatives products, options and futures; providing certain clearing services for derivatives products; and selling and distributing market data and related information. Cash Trading and Listings consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts global businesses: providing access to trade execution in cash trading; providing settlement of transactions in certain European markets; obtaining new listings and servicing existing listings; selling and distributing market data and related information; and providing regulatory services. Information Services and Technology Solutions consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts global businesses: operating sell side and buy side connectivity networks for our markets and for other major market centers and market participants in the United States, Europe and Asia; providing trading and information technology software and solutions; selling and distributing market data and related information to data subscribers for proprietary data products; and providing multi asset managed services and expert consultancy to exchanges and liquidity centers. For a discussion of these segments, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents Factors Affecting Our Results The business environment in which NYSE Euronext operates directly affects its results of operations. Our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors, including the level of trading activity in our markets, which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions, competition, market share and the pace of industry consolidation; broad trends in the brokerage and finance industry; price levels and price volatility; the number and financial health of companies listed on NYSE Euronexts cash markets; changing technology in the financial services industry; and legislative and regulatory changes, among other factors. See Item 1A Risk Factors. In particular, in recent years, the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants demand for speed, capacity and reliability, which requires continuing investment in technology; and increasing competition for market data revenues. The maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing. Uncertainty in the U.S. credit markets that commenced with the upheaval in 2008 continues to impact the economy. Equity market indices have experienced volatility and the market may remain volatile throughout 2012. Economic uncertainty in the European Union and the political upheaval in certain North African countries could spread to other countries and may continue to negatively affect global financial markets. While markets may improve, these factors have adversely affected our revenues and operating income and may negatively impact future growth. As a result of recent events, there has been, and it is likely that there will continue to be, significant change in the regulatory environment in which we operate. In particular, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law in July 2010. Although many of its provisions require the adoption of rules to implement, and it contains substantial ambiguities, many of which will not be resolved until regulations are adopted, such reforms could adversely affect our business or result in increased costs and the expenditure of significant resources. In addition, there are significant structural changes underway within the European regulatory framework. See Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Relating to Regulation We may be adversely affected by the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; We may be adversely affected by significant proposed European Union financial reforms; Changes to the regulators and agencies governing European financial markets could adversely affect our business. While we have not experienced reductions in our borrowing capacity, lenders in general have taken actions that indicate their concerns regarding liquidity in the marketplace. These actions have included reduced advance rates for certain security types, more stringent requirements for collateral eligibility and higher interest rates. Should lenders continue to take additional similar actions, the cost of conducting our business may increase and our ability to implement our business initiatives could be limited. We expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our businesses. Any potential growth in the global cash markets will likely be tempered by investor uncertainty resulting from volatility in the cost of energy and commodities, unemployment concerns, contagion concerns in relation to the sovereign debt issues faced by some members of the Eurozone, as well as the general state of the world economy. We continue to focus on our strategy to broaden and diversify our revenue streams, as well as our company wide expense reduction initiatives in order to mitigate these uncertainties. Recent Acquisitions and Other Transactions NYSE Amex Options On June 29, 2011, NYSE Euronext completed the sale of a significant equity interest in NYSE Amex Options, one of our two U.S. options exchanges, to seven external investors, BofA Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital, Citadel Securities, Citi, Goldman Sachs, TD AMERITRADE and UBS. NYSE Euronext remains the largest shareholder in the entity and manages the day to day operations of NYSE Amex Options, which operates under the supervision of a separate board of directors and a dedicated chief executive officer. NYSE Euronext consolidates this entity for financial reporting purposes. 51 Table of Contents As part of the agreement, the external investors have received an equity instrument which is tied to their individual contribution to the options exchanges success. Under the terms of the agreement, the external investors have the option to require NYSE Euronext to repurchase a portion of the instruments on an annual basis over the course of five years starting in 2011. The amount NYSE Euronext is required to purchase under this arrangement is capped each year at between approximately 5% and 15% of the total outstanding shares of NYSE Amex Options. On September 16, 2011, the external investors put back approximately 5% of the total outstanding shares of NYSE Amex Options to NYSE Euronext. NYSE Euronext recognized the full redemption value, i.e. fair value, of this instrument as mezzanine equity and classified the related balance as Redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2011. NYSE BlueTM On February 18, 2011, the formation of the NYSE Blue joint venture was consummated. NYSE Blue is a new global company that is majority owned by NYSE Euronext. NYSE Blue consists of the businesses of APX (headquartered in the New York City region) and BlueNext (headquartered in Paris). In its environmental unit, NYSE Blue provides infrastructure and services to environmental sponsors and market participants, through its environmental management account for asset and risk management as well as its registry services for renewable energy in the United States and voluntary carbon credits worldwide. Additionally, NYSE Blue operates, through BlueNext, a leading spot exchange for the European Emissions Trading System, a multi country, multi sector greenhouse gas emission trading scheme. In its power unit, NYSE Blue is a leading provider of hosted power scheduling and settlement services for wholesale power market participants. NYSE Euronext consolidates NYSE Blue for financial reporting purposes. New York Portfolio Clearing NYPC, NYSE Euronexts joint venture with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), became operational in the first quarter of 2011. NYPC currently clears fixed income futures traded on NYSE Liffe US and will have the ability to provide clearing services for other exchanges and Derivatives Clearing Organizations in the future. NYPC uses NYSE Euronexts clearing technology, TRS/CPS, to process and manage cleared positions and post trade position transfers. DTCCs Fixed Income Clearing Corporation provides capabilities in risk management, settlement, banking and reference data systems. As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext had a minority ownership interest in, and board representation on, DTCC. NYSE Euronext has agreed to make up to a $50 million financial guarantee as an additional contribution to the NYPC default fund, of which $25 million had been contributed as of December 31, 2011, and was held in escrow by NYPC. NYSE Euronexts investment in NYPC is treated as an equity method investment. Sale of American Stock Exchange building In the first quarter of 2011, the American Stock Exchange building (Amex building) was sold and, in accordance with the Amex acquisition agreement, approximately 340,000 NYSE Euronext shares of common stock were issued to former Amex members in June 2011. The issuance of shares represents the final consideration due to former Amex shareholders as part of the Amex acquisition agreement. National Stock Exchange of India On May 3, 2010, NYSE Euronext completed the sale of its 5% equity interest in the National Stock Exchange of India for gross proceeds of $175 million. A $56 million gain was included in Other income in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 as a result of this transaction. Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Assets Testing Methodology and Valuation Considerations Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable assets of a business acquired. In accordance with the Intangibles Goodwill and Other Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification), we test goodwill of our reporting units (which is generally one level below our three reportable segments) and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or 52 Table of Contents circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. We perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter. The impairment test of goodwill is performed in two steps. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In determining the fair value of our reporting units in step one of the goodwill impairment test, we compute the present value of discounted cash flows and terminal value projected for the reporting unit. The rate used to discount cash flows represents the weighted average cost of capital that we believe is reflective of the relevant risk associated with the projected cash flows. To validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of the reporting units determined in step one of the goodwill impairment test to the enterprise value of NYSE Euronext to derive the implied control premium. In performing this reconciliation, we may, depending on the volatility of our stock price, use either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, generally 30 days. We compare the implied control premium to premiums paid in observable recent transactions of comparable companies to determine if the fair value of the reporting units estimated in step one of the goodwill impairment test is reasonable. In accordance with Subtopic 10 in the Property, Plant, and Equipment Topic of the Codification, impairment exists when the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from it. An intangible asset subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of the intangible asset, indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as, but not limited to, the reporting unit at which goodwill should be measured for impairment, future operating performance and cash flows, cost of capital, terminal values, control premiums, remaining economic lives of assets, and the allocation of shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, in order to determine whether a decline in the value of certain securities and other investments is other than temporary, we evaluate, among other factors, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost. In particular, we consider the impact of duration and severity on the period of time expected for recovery to occur. If we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary, we write down the carrying value of the related asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we did not record any material impairment charge. Sources of Revenues Transaction and Clearing Fees Our transaction and clearing fees consist of fees collected from our cash trading, derivatives trading and clearing businesses. Cash trading. Revenues for cash trading consist of transaction charges for executing trades on our cash markets, as well as transaction charges related to orders on our U.S. cash markets which are routed to other market centers for execution. Additionally, our U.S. cash markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. These fees are designed to recover the costs to the government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. Activity assessment fees are 53 Table of Contents collected from member organizations executing trades on our U.S. cash markets, and are recognized when these amounts are invoiced. Fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and Section 31 fees do not have an impact on NYSE Euronexts net income. Derivatives trading and clearing. Revenues from derivatives trading and clearing consist of per contract fees for executing trades of derivatives contracts and clearing charges on the London market of NYSE Liffe and NYSE Liffe US and executing options contracts traded on NYSE Liffes continental Europe derivatives markets, NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. In some cases, these fees are subject to caps. Revenues for per contract fees are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract. The principal types of derivative contracts traded and cleared are equity and index products and short term interest rate products. Trading in equity products is primarily driven by price volatility in equity markets and indices and trading in short term interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from uncertainty over the direction of short term interest rates. The level of trading and clearing activity for all products is also influenced by market conditions and other factors. See Factors Affecting Our Results. Market Data We generate revenues from the dissemination of our market data in the U.S. and Europe to a variety of users. In the U.S., we collect market data fees principally for consortium based data products and, to a lesser extent, for NYSE proprietary data products. Consortium based data fees are dictated as part of the securities industry plans and charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. Consortium based data revenues from the dissemination of market data (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of a formula set by the SEC under Regulation NMS. Last sale prices and quotes in NYSE listed, NYSE Amex listed, and NYSE Arca listed securities are disseminated through Tape A and Tape B, which constitute the majority of the NYSE Euronexts U.S. revenues from consortium based market data revenues. We also receive a share of the revenues from Tape C, which represents data related to trading of certain securities that are listed on Nasdaq. These revenues are influenced by demand for the data by professional and nonprofessional subscribers. In addition, we receive fees for the display of data on television and for vendor access. Our proprietary products make market data available to subscribers covering activity that takes place solely on our U.S. markets, independent of activity on other markets. Our proprietary data products also include depth of book information, historical price information and corporate action information. NYSE Euronext offers NYSE Realtime Reference Prices, which allows internet and media organizations to buy real time, last sale market data from NYSE and provide it broadly and free of charge to the public. CNBC, Google Finance and nyse.com display NYSE Realtime stock prices on their respective websites. In Europe, we charge a variety of users, primarily the end users, for the use of Euronexts real time market data services. We also collect annual license fees from vendors for the right to distribute Euronext market data to third parties and a service fee from vendors for direct connection to market data. A substantial majority of European market data revenues is derived from monthly end user fees. We also derive revenues from selling historical and reference data about securities, and by publishing the daily official lists for the Euronext markets. The principal drivers of market data revenues are the number of end users and the prices for data packages. Listing There are two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our U.S. and European securities exchanges listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate related actions. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are generally not applicable to companies that transfer to one of our U.S. securities exchanges from another market, except for companies transferring to NYSE Amex from the over the counter market. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be listed, such as stock splits, rights issues, sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee. 54 Table of Contents In the U.S., annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of the listed U.S. company at the end of the prior year. Non U.S. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the United States. Annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original fees are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over estimated service periods of ten years for the NYSE and the Euronext cash equities markets and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Listing fees for our European markets comprise admission fees paid by issuers to list securities on the cash market, annual fees paid by companies whose financial instruments are listed on the cash market, and corporate activity and other fees, consisting primarily of fees charged by Euronext Paris and Euronext Lisbon for centralizing shares in IPOs and tender offers. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the market capitalization at the time of the IPO. Revenues from annual listing fees relate to the number of shares outstanding and the market capitalization of the listed company. In general, Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels and Euronext Lisbon have adopted a common set of listing fees. Under the harmonized fee book, domestic issuers (i.e., those from France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal) pay admission fees to list their securities based on the market capitalization of the respective issuer. Subsequent listings of securities receive a discount on admission fees. Domestic issuers also pay annual fees based on the number of equity securities and the market capitalization of the respective issuer. Non domestic companies listing in connection with raising capital are charged admission and annual fees on a similar basis, although they are generally charged lower maximum admission fees and annual fees. Non domestic companies that are in the Euronext 100 index are treated as domestic. Euronext Paris and Euronext Lisbon also charge centralization fees for collecting and allocating retail investor orders in IPOs and tender offers. The revenue NYSE Euronext derives from listing fees is primarily dependent on the number and size of new company listings as well as the level of other corporate related activity of existing listed issuers. The number and size of new company listings and other corporate related activity in any period depend primarily on factors outside of NYSE Euronexts control, including general economic conditions in Europe and the United States (in particular, stock market conditions) and the success of competing stock exchanges in attracting and retaining listed companies. Technology Services Revenues are generated primarily from connectivity services related to the SFTI and FIX networks, software licenses and maintenance fees as well as consulting services. Colocation revenue is recognized monthly over the life of the contract. We also generate revenues from software license contracts and maintenance agreements. We provide software that allows customers to receive comprehensive market agnostic connectivity, transaction and data management solutions. Software license revenues are recognized at the time of client acceptance and maintenance agreement revenues are recognized monthly over the life of the maintenance term subsequent to acceptance. Consulting services are offered for customization or installation of the software and for general advisory services. Consulting revenue is generally billed in arrears on a time and materials basis, although customers sometimes prepay for blocks of consulting services in bulk. NYSE Euronext records revenues from subscription agreements on a pro rata basis over the life of the subscription agreements. The unrealized portions of invoiced subscription fees, maintenance fees and prepaid consulting fees are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Other Revenues Other revenues include trading license fees, fees for facilities and other services provided to designated market markers (DMMs), brokers and clerks physically located on the floors of our U.S. markets that enable them to engage in the purchase and sale of securities on the trading floor, the revenues of our NYSE Blue joint venture and fees for clearance and settlement activities in our European markets, as well as regulatory revenues. Regulatory fees are charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges. Components of Expenses Section 31 Fees See Sources of Revenues Transaction and Clearing Fees above. 55 Table of Contents Liquidity Payments, Routing and Clearing We offer our customers a variety of liquidity payment structures, tailored to specific market, product and customer characteristics in order to attract order flow, enhance liquidity and promote use of our markets. We charge a per share or per contract execution fee to the market participant who takes the liquidity on certain of our trading platforms and, in turn, we pay, on certain of our markets, a portion of this per share or per contract execution fee to the market participant who provides the liquidity. We also incur routing charges in the U.S. when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our U.S. securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customers order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We include costs incurred due to erroneous trade execution within routing and clearing. Furthermore, NYSE Arca incurs clearance, brokerage and related transaction expenses, which primarily include costs incurred in self clearing activities, and per trade service fees paid to exchanges for trade execution. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses include compensation, depreciation and amortization, systems and communications, professional services, selling, general and administrative, and merger expenses and exit costs. Compensation Compensation expense includes employee salaries, incentive compensation (including stock based compensation) and related benefits expense, including pension, medical, post retirement medical and supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) charges. Part time help, primarily related to security personnel at the NYSE, is also recorded as part of compensation. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of costs from depreciating fixed assets (including computer hardware and capitalized software) and amortizing intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Systems and Communications Systems and communications expense includes costs for development and maintenance of trading, regulatory and administrative systems; investments in system capacity, reliability and security; and cost of network connectivity between our customers and data centers, as well as connectivity to various other market centers. Systems and communications expense also includes fees paid to third party providers of networks and information technology resources, including fees for consulting, research and development services, software rental costs and licenses, hardware rental and related fees paid to third party maintenance providers. Professional Services Professional services expense includes consulting charges related to various technological and operational initiatives, including fees paid to LCH.Clearnet in connection with certain clearing guarantee arrangements and FINRA in connection with the transfer of certain member firm regulatory functions, as well as legal and audit fees. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses include (i) occupancy costs; (ii) marketing costs consisting of advertising, printing and promotion expenses; (iii) insurance premiums, travel and entertainment expenses, co branding, investor education and advertising expenses with NYSE listed companies; (iv) general and administrative expenses; and (v) regulatory fine income levied by NYSE Regulation. Regulatory fine income must be used for regulatory purposes. Subsequent to the July 30, 2007 asset purchase agreement with FINRA, the amount of regulatory fine income has been relatively immaterial. 56 Table of Contents Merger Expenses and Exit Costs Merger expenses and exit costs consist of severance costs and related curtailment losses, contract termination costs, depreciation charges triggered by the acceleration of certain fixed asset useful lives, as well as legal and other professional fees and expenses directly attributable to business combinations and cost reduction initiatives. 57 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2011 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2010 The following table sets forth NYSE Euronexts consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each item for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2010.

This compares to total revenues, less transaction based expenses, operating income and net income attributable to NYSE Euronext of $2,511 million, $745 million and $577 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010. 58 Table of Contents The $161 million increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses, $105 million increase in operating income and $42 million increase in net income attributable to NYSE Euronext for the period reflect the following principal factors: Increased total revenues, less transaction based expenses Total revenues, less transaction based expenses increased primarily due to growth in technology services revenue, strong trading volumes in our European cash and U.S. derivatives businesses and positive foreign currency impact of $56 million. Increased operating income The period over period increase in operating income of $105 million was primarily due to an increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses of $56 million primarily related to legal, investment banking and other professional fees and costs incurred in connection with the terminated Proposed Business Combination with Deutsche B&ouml;rse. Excluding the net impact of merger and exit activities, a tax settlement related to BlueNext ($42 million), the impact of foreign currency ($27 million) and new business initiatives ($31 million), our other operating expenses decreased $70 million or 4% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Increased net income attributable to NYSE Euronext As compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, the period over period increase in net income attributable to NYSE Euronext of $42 million was mainly due to increased operating income and slightly lower effective tax rate. Segment Results We operate under three reportable segments: Derivatives, Cash Trading and Listings, and Information Services and Technology Solutions. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on revenue and operating income. For discussion of these segments, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements and Overview above. % of TotalRevenues Segment Revenues (in millions) 2011 2010 2011 2010 Derivatives $ 1,135 $ 1,088 25 % 25 % Cash Trading and Listings 2,929 2,893 64 % 65 % Information Services and Technology Solutions 490 444 11 % 10 % Total segment revenues $ 4,554 $ 4,425 100 % 100 % Derivatives Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2011 2010 Transaction and clearing fees $ 1,046 $ 1,005 4 % 92 % 93 % Market data 48 47 2 % 4 % 4 % Other revenues 41 36 14 % 4 % 3 % Total revenues 1,135 1,088 4 % 100 % 100 % Transaction based expenses: Liquidity payments, routing and clearing 274 262 5 % 24 % 24 % Total revenues, less transaction based expenses 861 826 4 % 76 % 76 % Merger expenses and exit costs 3 15 (80 )% 1 % 2 % Other operating expenses 388 372 4 % 34 % 34 % Operating income $ 470 $ 439 7 % 41 % 40 % 59 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2011, Derivatives operating income increased $31 million to $470 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our U.S. options trading volume of 20%, improved non transaction based revenues, reduced merger expenses and exit costs and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $16 million), partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses. Cash Trading and Listings Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2011 2010 Transaction and clearing fees $ 2,116 $ 2,123 % 72 % 73 % Market data 193 200 (4 )% 7 % 7 % Listing 446 422 6 % 15 % 15 % Other revenues 174 148 18 % 6 % 5 % Total revenues 2,929 2,893 1 % 100 % 100 % Transaction based expenses: Section 31 fees 371 315 18 % 13 % 11 % Liquidity payments, routing and clearing 1,235 1,337 (8 )% 42 % 46 % Total revenues, less transaction based expenses 1,323 1,241 7 % 45 % 43 % Merger expenses and exit costs 19 56 (66 )% 1 % 2 % Other operating expenses 832 809 3 % 28 % 28 % Operating income $ 472 $ 376 26 % 16 % 13 % For the year ended December 31, 2011, Cash Trading and Listings operating income increased $96 million to $472 million. This was primarily due to an increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses reflecting improved listing fees, an increase in our European cash trading volumes, higher average net revenue capture for U.S. cash equity, and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $10 million). Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 included a $42 million charge incurred in connection with BlueNexts settlement of a tax matter with the French tax authorities of which 40% or $17 million was contributed by Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts (see Noncontrolling Interest). Excluding the impact of the BlueNext tax matter, Cash Trading and Listings other operating expenses decreased $19 million as part of our cost containment initiatives. Information Services and Technology Solutions Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2011 2010 Market data $ 130 $ 126 3 % 27 % 28 % Technology services 360 318 13 % 73 % 72 % Total revenues 490 444 10 % 100 % 100 % Merger expenses and exit costs 4 17 (76 )% 1 % 4 % Other operating expenses 364 355 3 % 74 % 80 % Operating income $ 122 $ 72 69 % 25 % 16 % For the year ended December 31, 2011, Information Services and Technology Solutions operating income increased $50 million to $122 million. The increase was primarily due to the growth of our software business and the increase in our global connectivity fees related to the new data centers in Mahwah and Basildon as well as the 60 Table of Contents favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $4 million), partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses in connection with the run of our data centers, as well as new personnel and consultants to support the growth of our Information Services and Technology Solutions revenues. Corporate/Eliminations Year Ended December 31, (in millions) Increase 2011 2010 (Decrease) Other revenues $ (2 ) $ (100 )% Total revenues (2 ) (100 )% Merger expenses and exit costs 88 100 % Other operating expenses 124 142 (13 )% Operating (loss) income $ (214 ) $ (142 ) 51 % Corporate and eliminations include unallocated costs primarily related to corporate governance, public company expenses, duplicate costs associated with migrating our data centers and costs associated with our pension, SERP and postretirement benefit plans as well as intercompany eliminations of revenues and expenses. The increase in merger expenses and exit costs was mainly due to legal, investment banking and other professional fees and costs incurred in connection with the terminated Proposed Business Combination with Deutsche B&ouml;rse. Non Operating Income and Expenses Interest Expense Interest expense is primarily attributable to the interest expense on the debt incurred in connection with $750 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 1,000 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2015. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources). The increase is primarily a result of the fact that we no longer capitalize a portion of our interest expense for the development of our Mahwah and Basildon data centers which became operational in the second half of 2010. Interest and Investment Income The increase in our average cash and investment balances, reduction of interest rates and foreign currency rates were the primary drivers of the $4 million increase in investment income. Loss From Associates For the year ended December 31, 2011, the increase in loss from associates is primarily due to the impact of the investment in NYPC which was in development stage. Other Income For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a $56 million one time gain on the sale of our equity investment in the National Stock Exchange of India. We did not record any material other income or expense items in the 2011 period. Noncontrolling Interest For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, NYSE Euronext recorded noncontrolling interest loss of $16 million and $19 million, respectively. In 2011, noncontrolling interest loss consisted primarily of (i) the portion of the NYSE Liffe U.S. and NYSE Blue losses not owned by NYSE Euronext, (ii) the noncontrolling interest portion of the BlueNext tax settlement corresponding to Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts 40% pro rata share of such charge, partially offset by (iii) the noncontrolling interest income reflecting the profitability attributable to NYSE Amex Options. In June 2011, we completed the sale of a significant equity interest in NYSE Amex Options to seven external investors. 61 Table of Contents Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, NYSE Euronext provided for income taxes at an estimated tax rate of 17% and 19%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronexts overall effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to a discrete deferred tax benefit related to an enacted reduction in the corporate tax rate in the United Kingdom and higher earnings generated from foreign operations, where the applicable foreign jurisdictions tax rate is lower than the statutory rate. 62 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2010 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 For the year ended December 31, 2009, the results of operations of NYSE Euronext included the results of operations of NYFIX since its acquisition date on November 30, 2009. The following table sets forth NYSE Euronexts consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each item for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2009.

This compares to total revenues, less transaction based expenses, operating income and net income attributable to NYSE Euronext of $2,478 million, $286 million and $219 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $33 million increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses, $459 million increase in operating income and $358 million increase in net income attributable to NYSE Euronext for the period reflect the following principal factors: Increased total revenues, less transaction based expenses Total revenues, less transaction based expenses increased primarily due to increased volumes in our derivatives business and growth in information services and technology solutions offset by decreased volumes in certain U.S. cash trading venues and price changes in our European cash trading venues. See further detailed discussion within each segment analysis. Increased operating income The period over period increase in operating income of $459 million was primarily due to reduced other operating expenses of $426 million mainly associated with a one time NYSE Liffe Clearing payment of $355 million in 2009 and increased total revenues, less transaction based expenses. Excluding net impact of merger and acquisition activity ($54 million), the impact of foreign currency ($19 million), new business initiatives ($35 million) and data center integration costs ($45 million), our other operating expenses decreased $113 million or 7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Increased net income attributable to NYSE Euronext As compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, the period over period increase in net income attributable to NYSE Euronext of $358 million was mainly due to increased operating income and a $56 million one time gain on the sale of our 5% equity interest in the National Stock Exchange of India, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Segment Results We revised our reportable business segments effective in the first quarter of 2010. The new segments are Derivatives, Cash Trading and Listings, and Information Services and Technology Solutions. Historical financial results have been revised to reflect this change. For discussion of these segments, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements and Overview above. % of TotalRevenues Segment Revenues (in millions) 2010 2009 2010 2009 Derivatives $ 1,088 $ 918 25 % 20 % Cash Trading and Listings 2,893 3,397 65 % 73 % Information Services and Technology Solutions 444 363 10 % 7 % Total segment revenues $ 4,425 $ 4,678 100 % 100 % 64 Table of Contents Derivatives Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2010 2009 Transaction and clearing fees $ 1,005 $ 845 19 % 93 % 92 % Market data 47 42 12 % 4 % 5 % Other revenues 36 31 16 % 3 % 3 % Total revenues 1,088 918 19 % 100 % 100 % Transaction based expenses: Liquidity payments, routing and clearing 262 195 34 % 24 % 21 % Total revenues, less transaction based expenses 826 723 14 % 76 % 79 % Merger expenses and exit costs 15 382 (96 )% 2 % 42 % Other operating expenses 372 381 (2 )% 34 % 41 % Operating income (loss) $ 439 $ (40 ) NM 40 % (4 )% NM Not meaningful. For the year ended December 31, 2010, Derivatives operating income increased $479 million to $439 million. The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses reflecting an increase in our European average daily volume of 14.8% as compared to the same period a year ago, (ii) the inclusion of the full year results of NYSE Liffe Clearing in 2010, (iii) an increase in our U.S. options market share, (iv) reduced merger expenses and exit costs which included a one time NYSE Liffe Clearing payment of $355 million in 2009 and (v) a $9 million decrease of other operating expenses reflecting the results of operating efficiencies, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $10 million). Cash Trading and Listings Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2010 2009 Transaction and clearing fees $ 2,123 $ 2,582 (18 )% 73 % 76 % Market data 200 221 (10 )% 7 % 7 % Listing 422 407 4 % 15 % 12 % Other revenues 148 187 (21 )% 5 % 5 % Total revenues 2,893 3,397 (15 )% 100 % 100 % Transaction based expenses: Section 31 fees 315 388 (19 )% 11 % 11 % Liquidity payments, routing and clearing 1,337 1,623 (18 )% 46 % 48 % Total revenues, less transaction based expenses 1,241 1,386 (10 )% 43 % 41 % Merger expenses and exit costs 56 104 (46 )% 2 % 3 % Other operating expenses 809 867 (7 )% 28 % 26 % Operating income $ 376 $ 415 (9 )% 13 % 12 % 65 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2010, Cash Trading and Listings operating income decreased $39 million to $376 million. This was primarily due to a $145 million decrease in total revenues, less transaction based expenses. Our U.S. venues average daily volume experienced a 20.9% decline while improving revenue capture. Our European venues had an increase in average daily volume of 6.8% and deteriorated, yet stabilized by year end, revenue capture. The decline in our total revenues, less transaction based expenses was partially offset by reduced levels of merger expenses and exit costs as well as a $58 million decrease of other operating expenses as part of our cost containment initiatives. Information Services and Technology Solutions Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2010 2009 Market data $ 126 $ 140 (10 )% 28 % 39 % Technology services 318 223 43 % 72 % 61 % Total revenues 444 363 22 % 100 % 100 % Merger expenses and exit costs 17 27 (37 )% 4 % 7 % Other operating expenses 355 309 15 % 80 % 85 % Operating income $ 72 $ 27 167 % 16 % 8 % For the year ended December 31, 2010, Information Services and Technology Solutions operating income increased $45 million to $72 million. The increase was primarily due to the growth of our software business and the inclusion of the full year results of NYFIX in 2010, a business acquired on November 30, 2009. Corporate/Eliminations Year Ended December 31, (in millions) Increase 2010 2009 (Decrease) Other revenues $ $ 6 (100 )% Total revenues 6 (100 )% Merger expenses and exit costs 3 (100 )% Other operating expenses 142 119 19 % Operating (loss) income $ (142 ) $ (116 ) 22 % Corporate and eliminations include unallocated costs primarily related to corporate governance, public company expenses, duplicate costs associated with migrating our data centers and costs associated with our pension, SERP and postretirement benefit plans as well as intercompany eliminations of revenues and expenses. The increase in other operating expenses is mainly due to increased data center migration costs. Non Operating Income and Expenses Interest Expense Interest expense is primarily attributable to the interest expense on the debt incurred in connection with $750 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 1,000 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2015. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources). The reduction in interest expense is primarily driven by lower outstanding debt balances. Interest and Investment Income The decrease in our average cash and investment balances, reduction of interest rates and foreign currency rates were the primary drivers of the $8 million decrease in investment income. 66 Table of Contents Income (Loss) From Associates For the year ended December 31, 2010, the decrease in income (loss) from associates is primarily due to the impact of the investment in NYPC which was in development stage. Other Income For the year ended December 31, 2010, other income increased $27 million to $55 million as compared to the same period a year ago. The increase is primarily due to a $56 million gain on the sale of our equity investment in the National Stock Exchange of India, partially offset by foreign exchange gains and losses and dividends on certain investments, which may vary period over period. Noncontrolling Interest For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, NYSE Euronext recorded noncontrolling interest loss of $19 million and $7 million, respectively. The increase of $12 million in noncontrolling interest loss year over year primarily reflects the reduced profitability of NYSE Blue and the operating losses of NYSE Liffe U.S., which was in development stage. Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, NYSE Euronext provided for income taxes at an estimated tax rate of 19% and benefited from income taxes at an estimated tax rate of 3%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010, NYSE Euronexts overall effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to lower tax rates on its foreign operations, the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and a discrete deferred tax benefit related to an enacted reduction in the corporate tax rate in both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Liquidity and Capital Resources NYSE Euronexts financial policy seeks to finance the growth of its business, remunerate shareholders and ensure financial flexibility, while maintaining strong creditworthiness and liquidity. NYSE Euronexts primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, current assets and existing bank facilities. NYSE Euronexts principal liquidity requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate use. Cash Flows For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,000 million, representing primarily net income of $603 million, depreciation and amortization of $286 million, partially offset by a positive change in working capital of $206 million. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $170 million. Under the terms of the operating agreement of the NYSE, no regulatory fees, fines or penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be distributed to NYSE Euronext or any entity other than NYSE Regulation. As a result, the use of regulatory fees, fines and penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be considered restricted. As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext did not have significant restricted cash balances. Net Financial Indebtedness As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext had approximately $2.1 billion in debt outstanding and $0.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and financial investments, resulting in $1.7 billion in net indebtedness. We define net indebtedness as outstanding debt less cash, cash equivalents and financial investments. 67 Table of Contents Net indebtedness was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 396 $ 327 Financial investments 36 52 Cash, cash equivalents and financial investments [a] $ 432 $ 379 Short term debt 39 366 Long term debt 2,036 2,074 Total debt [b] $ 2,075 $ 2,440 Net indebtedness [b] [a] $ 1,643 $ 2,061 Cash, cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronexts main debt instruments were as follows (in millions): PrincipalAmount Maturity 4.8% bond in U.S. dollar $750 June 30, 2013 5.375% bond in Euro 1,000($1,296) June 30, 2015 In 2007, NYSE Euronext entered into a U.S. dollar and euro denominated global commercial paper program of $3.0 billion in order to refinance the acquisition of the Euronext shares. As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext had no debt outstanding under this commercial paper program. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (Libor U.S. for commercial paper issued in U.S. dollar and Euribor for commercial paper issued in euro). The fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may therefore impact the interest expense incurred by NYSE Euronext. The commercial paper program is backed by a $1.4 billion syndicated revolving bank facility maturing on July 31, 2012. This bank facility is also available for general corporate purposes and was not drawn as of December 31, 2011. This bank facility was initially entered into in 2007 for an amount of $2.0 billion and was subsequently amended on December 8, 2011. Pursuant to the amendment, the size of the facility decreased to $1,357 million as of December 8, 2011 and will further decrease to $1.2 billion as of April 4, 2012. In August 2006, prior to the combination with NYSE Group, Euronext entered into a 300 million revolving credit facility available for general corporate purposes, which matured on August 4, 2011. The commercial paper program and the credit facilities include terms and conditions customary for agreements of this type, which may restrict NYSE Euronexts ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness In 2008, NYSE Euronext issued $750 million of 4.8% fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 750 million of 5.375% fixed rate bonds due in June 2015 in order to, among other things, refinance outstanding commercial paper and lengthen the maturity profile of its debt. In 2009, NYSE Euronext increased the 750 million 5.375% notes due in June 2015 to 1 billion as a result of an incremental offering of 250 million. The terms of the bonds do not contain any financial covenants. The bonds may be redeemed by NYSE Euronext or the bond holders under certain customary circumstances, including a change in control accompanied by a downgrade of the bonds below an investment grade rating. The terms of the bonds also provide for customary events of default and a negative pledge covenant. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all of our debt instruments covenants in all material respects. Liquidity Risk NYSE Euronext continually reviews its liquidity and debt positions, and subject to market conditions and credit and strategic considerations, may from time to time determine to vary the maturity profile of its debt and 68 Table of Contents diversify its sources of financing. NYSE Euronext anticipates being able to support short term liquidity and operating needs primarily through existing cash balances and financing arrangements, along with future cash flows from operations. If existing financing arrangements are insufficient to meet anticipated needs or to refinance existing debt, NYSE Euronext may seek additional financing in either the debt or equity markets. NYSE Euronext may also seek equity or debt financing in connection with future acquisitions or other strategic transactions. While we believe that we generally have access to debt markets, including bank facilities and publicly and privately issued long and short term debt, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. Because new issues of commercial paper generally fund the retirement of outstanding issues, NYSE Euronext is also exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to refinance outstanding commercial paper. In order to mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain backstop bank facilities for an aggregate amount exceeding at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program. In the event that we are unable to issue new commercial paper, we may draw on these backstop facilities. Share Repurchase Program In 2008, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our common stock. Under the program, we may repurchase stock from time to time at the discretion of management in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to applicable United States or European laws, regulations and approvals, strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors. This stock repurchase plan does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of our common stock and any such repurchases will be made in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations, including rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable EU regulations and regulations of the AMF. A summary of common stock purchases is as follows: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Period Total Number ofShares Purchased AveragePrice PaidPer Share Total Number of SharesPurchased as Part ofPublicly AnnouncedPlans or Programs Approximate DollarValue of Shares thatMay Yet BePurchased Under thePlans or Programs $ 1,000 2008 13,363,661 $ 26.04 13,363,661 652 2009/2010 13,363,661 652 2011(1) 3,712,261 26.96 17,075,922 552 17,075,922 (1) All shares were repurchased during the month of November 2011. 69 Table of Contents Summary Disclosures About Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes NYSE Euronexts debt, future minimum lease obligations on its operating leases and other commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): Payments Due by Year(1) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Debt (principal and accrued interest obligations) $ 2,075 $ 39 $ 749 $ $ 1,287 $ $ Debt (future interest obligations) 298 70 88 70 70 Operating lease obligations 345 63 58 51 42 25 106 Other commitments(2) 77 40 37 $ 2,795 $ 212 $ 932 $ 121 $ 1,399 $ 25 $ 106 (1) As of December 31, 2011, obligations under capital leases were not significant. NYSE Euronext also has obligations related to other post retirement benefits, deferred compensation and unrecognized tax positions. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined. See Notes 7 Pension and Other Benefit Programs, 9 Stock Based Compensation, and 15 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, the external investors in our NYSE Amex Options market have received an equity instrument which is tied to their individual contribution to the options exchanges success and have the option to require NYSE Euronext to repurchase a portion of the instruments on an annual basis over the course of five years starting in 2011. The amount NYSE Euronext is required to purchase under this arrangement is capped each year at between 5% and 15% of the total outstanding shares of NYSE Amex Options. NYSE Euronext recognized the full redemption value, i.e. fair value, of this instrument as mezzanine equity and classified the related balance as Redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2011. However, NYSE Euronext cannot predict whether the external investors will elect to exercise their put option. (2) Primarily reflects the outstanding commitment for our investment in the Qatar Exchange. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following provides information about NYSE Euronexts critical accounting policies and estimates. Critical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially produce materially different results, assumptions and conditions. Revenue Recognition There are two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our exchanges listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate actions. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are not applicable to companies when they list on the NYSE or NYSE Arca in the context of a transfer from another market. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares. Annual fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original listing fees are recognized on a straight line basis over their estimated service periods of 10 years for NYSE and Euronext, and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, NYSE Euronext, through NYSE Technologies Trading Solutions business, licenses software and provides software services which are accounted for in accordance with Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic of the Codifications. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets NYSE Euronext reviews the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based upon estimated fair value of NYSE Euronexts reporting units. Should the review indicate that goodwill is impaired, 70 Table of Contents NYSE Euronexts goodwill would be reduced by the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its fair value. NYSE Euronext reviews the useful life of its indefinite lived intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life categorization. In addition, the carrying value of NYSE Euronexts indefinite lived intangible assets is reviewed by NYSE Euronext at least annually for impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the asset. For purposes of performing the impairment test, fair values are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which, among other factors, is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long term rate of growth for businesses, and determination of weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill and other intangible impairment for each reporting unit. Income Taxes NYSE Euronext records income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and tax bases in assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided for certain tax carryforwards. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. NYSE Euronext is subject to tax regulations in numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions primarily based on its operations in these jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in NYSE Euronexts financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could have material impact on NYSE Euronexts financial position or results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Employee Benefits Pension and Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates to measure future obligation and interest expense, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates and other factors. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect NYSE Euronexts pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense. Hedging Activities NYSE Euronext uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. NYSE Euronext accounts for derivatives pursuant to the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Codification. The Derivatives and Hedging Topic establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires that all derivatives be recorded at fair value on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in other comprehensive income or net income depending on whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in cash flows or changes in fair value. Recently Issued Accounting Guidance The FASB issued ASU 2011 05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, and ASU 2011 12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other 71 Table of Contents Comprehensive Income in ASU 2011 05, which amend certain provisions in Subtopic 220 10 in the Comprehensive Income Topic of the Codification. The amendments in ASU 2011 05 require that the net income and other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income. The ASU 2011 05 also requires reclassification of other comprehensive income components to be presented in the face of the income statement as well as in the face of the statement of comprehensive income. The amendments in ASU 2011 05 do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The amendments also do not change the option for an entity to present components of other comprehensive income either net of related tax effects or before related tax effects, with one amount shown for the aggregate income tax expense or benefit related to the total of other comprehensive income items. In both cases, the tax effect for each component must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements or presented in the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. However, the ASU 2011 12 postponed the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in ASU 2011 05. Both ASU 2011 05 and ASU 2011 12 amendments should be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. NYSE Euronext adopted these provisions in 2011, and they did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued ASU 2011 08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which amends certain provisions in Subtopic 350 20 in the Intangibles Goodwill and Other Topic of the Codification. The amendments in ASU 2011 08 provide changes to the goodwill impairment guidance that are intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual impairment test. The changes allow entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The new qualitative indicators replace those currently used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required. In addition, the indicators will be applicable for assessing whether to perform step two for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. These amendments will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. We do not believe that this will have a significant impact on our financial statements. The FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009 13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, which supersedes certain provisions in Subtopic 25 in the Revenue Recognition Topic of the Codification. ASU 2009 13 requires an entity to allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices. It also eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation which was allowed under previous guidance and requires the use of the relative selling price method in all circumstances in which an entity recognizes revenue for an arrangement with multiple deliverable subject to the Subtopic 25 in the Revenue Recognition Topic. ASU 2009 13 also requires both ongoing disclosures regarding an entitys multiple element revenue arrangements as well as certain transitional disclosures during periods after adoption. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We adopted this as of January 1, 2011, and the adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. The FASB issued ASU 2009 14, Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements, which amends certain provisions in Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic of the Codification. The amendments in ASU 2009 14 change revenue recognition for tangible products containing software elements and non software elements as follows: (1) the tangible element of the product is always outside the scope of Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic; (2) the software elements of tangible products are outside of the scope of Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic when the software elements and non software elements function together to deliver the products essential functionality and (3) undelivered elements in the arrangement related to the non software components also are excluded from the software revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2009 14 applies to transactions which contain both software and non software elements. For these transactions, companies will have to go through a two step process for the software elements. First, a company has to allocate the total consideration to separate units of account for the non software elements and software elements as a group, using relative selling price 72 Table of Contents method. Second, the amount allocated to the software elements as a group will then be accounted for in accordance with the requirements in Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic of the Codification. This may require the use of Residual Method of allocation if VSOE (vendor specific objective evidence) or TPE (third party evidence) does not exist for the undelivered elements. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, and it is also applicable to existing arrangements that are materially modified after the effective date. We adopted this as of January 1, 2011, and the adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK General As a result of its operating and financing activities, NYSE Euronext is exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, currency risk and credit risk. NYSE Euronext has implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. NYSE Euronexts central treasury is charged with identifying risk exposures and monitoring and managing such risks on a daily basis. To the extent permitted by local regulation and necessary, NYSE Euronexts subsidiaries centralize their cash investments, report their risks and hedge their exposures with the central treasury. NYSE Euronext performs sensitivity analyses to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have. NYSE Euronext uses derivative instruments solely to hedge financial risks related to its financial positions or risks that are otherwise incurred in the normal course of its commercial activities. It does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Except for fixed rate bonds, most of NYSE Euronexts financial assets and liabilities are based on floating rates, on fixed rates with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in less than one year or on fixed rates that have been swapped to floating rates via fixed to floating rate swaps. The following table summarizes NYSE Euronexts exposure to interest rate risk as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): FinancialAssets FinancialLiabilities NetExposure Impact(2) of a100 bpsAdverse Shift inInterest Rates(3) Floating rate(1) positions in Dollar $ 162 $ 4 $ 158 $ (1.6 ) Euro 31 35 (4 ) (0.1 ) Sterling 204 204 (2.0 ) Fixed rate positions in Dollar 749 (749 ) (11.3 ) Euro 1,287 (1,287 ) (43.2 ) Sterling (1) Includes floating rate, fixed rate with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in less than one year and fixed rate swapped to floating rate. (2) Impact on profit and loss for floating rate positions (cash flow risk) and on equity until realization in profit and loss for fixed rate positions (price risk). (3) 100 basis points parallel shift of yield curve. 73 Table of Contents NYSE Euronext is exposed to price risk on its outstanding fixed rate positions. As of December 31, 2011, fixed rate positions in U.S. dollar and in euro with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in more than one year amounted to $749 million and $1,287 million, respectively. A hypothetical shift of 1% in the U.S. dollar or in the euro interest rate curves would in the aggregate impact the fair value of these positions by $11.3 million and $43.2 million, respectively. NYSE Euronext is exposed to cash flow risk on its floating rate positions. Because NYSE Euronext is a net lender in U.S. dollar and sterling, when interest rates in U.S. dollar or sterling decrease, NYSE Euronexts net interest and investment income decreases. Based on December 31, 2011 positions, a hypothetical 1% decrease in U.S. dollar or sterling rates would negatively impact annual income by $1.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. Because NYSE Euronext is a net borrower in euro, when interest rates in euro increase, NYSE Euronext net interest and investment income decreases. Based on December 31, 2011 positions, a hypothetical 1% increase in euro rates would negatively impact annual income by less than $0.1 million. Currency Risk As an international group, NYSE Euronext is subject to currency translation risk. A significant part of NYSE Euronexts assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses is recorded in euro and sterling. Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. NYSE Euronexts exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (in millions, except average rates): Euro Sterling Average rate in the period $ 1.3923 $ 1.6040 Average rate in the same period one year before $ 1.3269 $ 1.5457 Foreign denominated percentage of Revenues 17 % 15 % Operating expenses 10 % 14 % Operating income 46 % 20 % Impact of the currency fluctuations(1) on Revenues 35.6 25.9 Operating expenses 15.6 18.8 Operating income 20.0 7.1 (1) Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year. 74 Table of Contents NYSE Euronexts exposure to net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions): December 31,2011 Position in Position in Euros Sterling Assets 3,899 &pound; 2,680 of which goodwill 1,043 1,072 Liabilities 2,000 396 of which borrowings 1,018 Net currency position before hedging activities 1,899 2,284 Impact of hedging activities 268 209 Net currency position 2,167 &pound; 2,493 Impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates $ (281 ) $ (387 ) As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext was exposed to net exposures in euro and sterling of 2.2 billion ($2.8 billion) and &pound;2.5 billion ($3.9 billion), respectively. NYSE Euronexts borrowings in euro of 1.0 billion ($1.3 billion) constitute a partial hedge of NYSE Euronexts net investments in foreign entities. As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext also had 268 million ($348 million) Euro/dollar and &pound;209 million ($325 million) sterling/dollar foreign exchange swaps outstanding. These swaps matured during January 2012. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of these swaps was a $1 million net liability. Based on December 31, 2011 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of the euro against the dollar would negatively impacted NYSE Euronexts equity by $281 million and a hypothetical 10% decrease of the sterling against the dollar would negatively impacted NYSE Euronexts equity by $387 million. For the year ended December 31, 2011, currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of $133 million on NYSE Euronexts consolidated equity. Credit Risk NYSE Euronext is exposed to credit risk in the event of a counterparty default. NYSE Euronext limits its exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which it makes investments and executes agreements. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. NYSE Euronexts investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. NYSE Euronext seeks to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties. An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, NYSE Euronexts policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk. Derivatives are negotiated with highly rated banks. 75 Table of Contents

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements. Actual results may differ from such forward looking statements. See Item 1A Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. Certain prior period amounts presented in the discussion and analysis have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Overview NYSE Euronext was formed from the combination of the businesses of NYSE Group and Euronext, which was consummated on April 4, 2007. Following consummation of the combination, NYSE Euronext became the parent company of NYSE Group and Euronext and each of their respective subsidiaries. Under the purchase method of accounting, NYSE Group was treated as the accounting and legal acquirer in the combination with Euronext. On October 1, 2008, NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of The Amex Membership Corporation, including its subsidiary the American Stock Exchange, which is now known as NYSE Amex. NYSE Euronext operates under three reportable segments: Derivatives, Cash Trading and Listings, and Information Services and Technology Solutions. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on revenue and operating income. We have aggregated all of our corporate costs, including the costs to operate as a public company, within Corporate/ Eliminations. The following is a description of our reportable segments: Derivatives consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts global businesses: providing access to trade execution in derivatives products, options and futures; providing certain clearing services for derivatives products; and selling and distributing market data and related information. Cash Trading and Listings consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts global businesses: providing access to trade execution in cash trading; providing settlement of transactions in certain European markets; obtaining new listings and servicing existing listings; selling and distributing market data and related information; and providing regulatory services. Information Services and Technology Solutions consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts global businesses: operating sell side and buy side connectivity networks for our markets and for other major market centers and market participants in the United States, Europe and Asia; providing trading and information technology software and solutions; selling and distributing market data and related information to data subscribers for proprietary data products; and providing multi asset managed services and expert consultancy to exchanges and liquidity centers. For a discussion of these segments, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents Factors Affecting Our Results The business environment in which NYSE Euronext operates directly affects its results of operations. Our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors, including the level of trading activity in our markets, which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions, competition, market share and the pace of industry consolidation; broad trends in the brokerage and finance industry; price levels and price volatility; the number and financial health of companies listed on NYSE Euronexts cash markets; changing technology in the financial services industry; and legislative and regulatory changes, among other factors. See Item 1A Risk Factors. In particular, in recent years, the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants demand for speed, capacity and reliability, which requires continuing investment in technology; and increasing competition for market data revenues. The maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing. Uncertainty in the U.S. credit markets that commenced with the upheaval in 2008 continues to impact the economy. Equity market indices have experienced volatility and the market may remain volatile throughout 2012. Economic uncertainty in the European Union and the political upheaval in certain North African countries could spread to other countries and may continue to negatively affect global financial markets. While markets may improve, these factors have adversely affected our revenues and operating income and may negatively impact future growth. As a result of recent events, there has been, and it is likely that there will continue to be, significant change in the regulatory environment in which we operate. In particular, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law in July 2010. Although many of its provisions require the adoption of rules to implement, and it contains substantial ambiguities, many of which will not be resolved until regulations are adopted, such reforms could adversely affect our business or result in increased costs and the expenditure of significant resources. In addition, there are significant structural changes underway within the European regulatory framework. See Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Relating to Regulation We may be adversely affected by the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; We may be adversely affected by significant proposed European Union financial reforms; Changes to the regulators and agencies governing European financial markets could adversely affect our business. While we have not experienced reductions in our borrowing capacity, lenders in general have taken actions that indicate their concerns regarding liquidity in the marketplace. These actions have included reduced advance rates for certain security types, more stringent requirements for collateral eligibility and higher interest rates. Should lenders continue to take additional similar actions, the cost of conducting our business may increase and our ability to implement our business initiatives could be limited. We expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our businesses. Any potential growth in the global cash markets will likely be tempered by investor uncertainty resulting from volatility in the cost of energy and commodities, unemployment concerns, contagion concerns in relation to the sovereign debt issues faced by some members of the Eurozone, as well as the general state of the world economy. We continue to focus on our strategy to broaden and diversify our revenue streams, as well as our company wide expense reduction initiatives in order to mitigate these uncertainties. Recent Acquisitions and Other Transactions NYSE Amex Options On June 29, 2011, NYSE Euronext completed the sale of a significant equity interest in NYSE Amex Options, one of our two U.S. options exchanges, to seven external investors, BofA Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital, Citadel Securities, Citi, Goldman Sachs, TD AMERITRADE and UBS. NYSE Euronext remains the largest shareholder in the entity and manages the day to day operations of NYSE Amex Options, which operates under the supervision of a separate board of directors and a dedicated chief executive officer. NYSE Euronext consolidates this entity for financial reporting purposes. 51 Table of Contents As part of the agreement, the external investors have received an equity instrument which is tied to their individual contribution to the options exchanges success. Under the terms of the agreement, the external investors have the option to require NYSE Euronext to repurchase a portion of the instruments on an annual basis over the course of five years starting in 2011. The amount NYSE Euronext is required to purchase under this arrangement is capped each year at between approximately 5% and 15% of the total outstanding shares of NYSE Amex Options. On September 16, 2011, the external investors put back approximately 5% of the total outstanding shares of NYSE Amex Options to NYSE Euronext. NYSE Euronext recognized the full redemption value, i.e. fair value, of this instrument as mezzanine equity and classified the related balance as Redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2011. NYSE BlueTM On February 18, 2011, the formation of the NYSE Blue joint venture was consummated. NYSE Blue is a new global company that is majority owned by NYSE Euronext. NYSE Blue consists of the businesses of APX (headquartered in the New York City region) and BlueNext (headquartered in Paris). In its environmental unit, NYSE Blue provides infrastructure and services to environmental sponsors and market participants, through its environmental management account for asset and risk management as well as its registry services for renewable energy in the United States and voluntary carbon credits worldwide. Additionally, NYSE Blue operates, through BlueNext, a leading spot exchange for the European Emissions Trading System, a multi country, multi sector greenhouse gas emission trading scheme. In its power unit, NYSE Blue is a leading provider of hosted power scheduling and settlement services for wholesale power market participants. NYSE Euronext consolidates NYSE Blue for financial reporting purposes. New York Portfolio Clearing NYPC, NYSE Euronexts joint venture with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), became operational in the first quarter of 2011. NYPC currently clears fixed income futures traded on NYSE Liffe US and will have the ability to provide clearing services for other exchanges and Derivatives Clearing Organizations in the future. NYPC uses NYSE Euronexts clearing technology, TRS/CPS, to process and manage cleared positions and post trade position transfers. DTCCs Fixed Income Clearing Corporation provides capabilities in risk management, settlement, banking and reference data systems. As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext had a minority ownership interest in, and board representation on, DTCC. NYSE Euronext has agreed to make up to a $50 million financial guarantee as an additional contribution to the NYPC default fund, of which $25 million had been contributed as of December 31, 2011, and was held in escrow by NYPC. NYSE Euronexts investment in NYPC is treated as an equity method investment. Sale of American Stock Exchange building In the first quarter of 2011, the American Stock Exchange building (Amex building) was sold and, in accordance with the Amex acquisition agreement, approximately 340,000 NYSE Euronext shares of common stock were issued to former Amex members in June 2011. The issuance of shares represents the final consideration due to former Amex shareholders as part of the Amex acquisition agreement. National Stock Exchange of India On May 3, 2010, NYSE Euronext completed the sale of its 5% equity interest in the National Stock Exchange of India for gross proceeds of $175 million. A $56 million gain was included in Other income in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 as a result of this transaction. Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Assets Testing Methodology and Valuation Considerations Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable assets of a business acquired. In accordance with the Intangibles Goodwill and Other Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification), we test goodwill of our reporting units (which is generally one level below our three reportable segments) and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or 52 Table of Contents circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. We perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter. The impairment test of goodwill is performed in two steps. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In determining the fair value of our reporting units in step one of the goodwill impairment test, we compute the present value of discounted cash flows and terminal value projected for the reporting unit. The rate used to discount cash flows represents the weighted average cost of capital that we believe is reflective of the relevant risk associated with the projected cash flows. To validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of the reporting units determined in step one of the goodwill impairment test to the enterprise value of NYSE Euronext to derive the implied control premium. In performing this reconciliation, we may, depending on the volatility of our stock price, use either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, generally 30 days. We compare the implied control premium to premiums paid in observable recent transactions of comparable companies to determine if the fair value of the reporting units estimated in step one of the goodwill impairment test is reasonable. In accordance with Subtopic 10 in the Property, Plant, and Equipment Topic of the Codification, impairment exists when the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from it. An intangible asset subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of the intangible asset, indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as, but not limited to, the reporting unit at which goodwill should be measured for impairment, future operating performance and cash flows, cost of capital, terminal values, control premiums, remaining economic lives of assets, and the allocation of shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, in order to determine whether a decline in the value of certain securities and other investments is other than temporary, we evaluate, among other factors, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost. In particular, we consider the impact of duration and severity on the period of time expected for recovery to occur. If we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary, we write down the carrying value of the related asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we did not record any material impairment charge. Sources of Revenues Transaction and Clearing Fees Our transaction and clearing fees consist of fees collected from our cash trading, derivatives trading and clearing businesses. Cash trading. Revenues for cash trading consist of transaction charges for executing trades on our cash markets, as well as transaction charges related to orders on our U.S. cash markets which are routed to other market centers for execution. Additionally, our U.S. cash markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. These fees are designed to recover the costs to the government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. Activity assessment fees are 53 Table of Contents collected from member organizations executing trades on our U.S. cash markets, and are recognized when these amounts are invoiced. Fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and Section 31 fees do not have an impact on NYSE Euronexts net income. Derivatives trading and clearing. Revenues from derivatives trading and clearing consist of per contract fees for executing trades of derivatives contracts and clearing charges on the London market of NYSE Liffe and NYSE Liffe US and executing options contracts traded on NYSE Liffes continental Europe derivatives markets, NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. In some cases, these fees are subject to caps. Revenues for per contract fees are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract. The principal types of derivative contracts traded and cleared are equity and index products and short term interest rate products. Trading in equity products is primarily driven by price volatility in equity markets and indices and trading in short term interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from uncertainty over the direction of short term interest rates. The level of trading and clearing activity for all products is also influenced by market conditions and other factors. See Factors Affecting Our Results. Market Data We generate revenues from the dissemination of our market data in the U.S. and Europe to a variety of users. In the U.S., we collect market data fees principally for consortium based data products and, to a lesser extent, for NYSE proprietary data products. Consortium based data fees are dictated as part of the securities industry plans and charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. Consortium based data revenues from the dissemination of market data (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of a formula set by the SEC under Regulation NMS. Last sale prices and quotes in NYSE listed, NYSE Amex listed, and NYSE Arca listed securities are disseminated through Tape A and Tape B, which constitute the majority of the NYSE Euronexts U.S. revenues from consortium based market data revenues. We also receive a share of the revenues from Tape C, which represents data related to trading of certain securities that are listed on Nasdaq. These revenues are influenced by demand for the data by professional and nonprofessional subscribers. In addition, we receive fees for the display of data on television and for vendor access. Our proprietary products make market data available to subscribers covering activity that takes place solely on our U.S. markets, independent of activity on other markets. Our proprietary data products also include depth of book information, historical price information and corporate action information. NYSE Euronext offers NYSE Realtime Reference Prices, which allows internet and media organizations to buy real time, last sale market data from NYSE and provide it broadly and free of charge to the public. CNBC, Google Finance and nyse.com display NYSE Realtime stock prices on their respective websites. In Europe, we charge a variety of users, primarily the end users, for the use of Euronexts real time market data services. We also collect annual license fees from vendors for the right to distribute Euronext market data to third parties and a service fee from vendors for direct connection to market data. A substantial majority of European market data revenues is derived from monthly end user fees. We also derive revenues from selling historical and reference data about securities, and by publishing the daily official lists for the Euronext markets. The principal drivers of market data revenues are the number of end users and the prices for data packages. Listing There are two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our U.S. and European securities exchanges listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate related actions. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are generally not applicable to companies that transfer to one of our U.S. securities exchanges from another market, except for companies transferring to NYSE Amex from the over the counter market. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be listed, such as stock splits, rights issues, sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee. 54 Table of Contents In the U.S., annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of the listed U.S. company at the end of the prior year. Non U.S. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the United States. Annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original fees are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over estimated service periods of ten years for the NYSE and the Euronext cash equities markets and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Listing fees for our European markets comprise admission fees paid by issuers to list securities on the cash market, annual fees paid by companies whose financial instruments are listed on the cash market, and corporate activity and other fees, consisting primarily of fees charged by Euronext Paris and Euronext Lisbon for centralizing shares in IPOs and tender offers. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the market capitalization at the time of the IPO. Revenues from annual listing fees relate to the number of shares outstanding and the market capitalization of the listed company. In general, Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels and Euronext Lisbon have adopted a common set of listing fees. Under the harmonized fee book, domestic issuers (i.e., those from France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal) pay admission fees to list their securities based on the market capitalization of the respective issuer. Subsequent listings of securities receive a discount on admission fees. Domestic issuers also pay annual fees based on the number of equity securities and the market capitalization of the respective issuer. Non domestic companies listing in connection with raising capital are charged admission and annual fees on a similar basis, although they are generally charged lower maximum admission fees and annual fees. Non domestic companies that are in the Euronext 100 index are treated as domestic. Euronext Paris and Euronext Lisbon also charge centralization fees for collecting and allocating retail investor orders in IPOs and tender offers. The revenue NYSE Euronext derives from listing fees is primarily dependent on the number and size of new company listings as well as the level of other corporate related activity of existing listed issuers. The number and size of new company listings and other corporate related activity in any period depend primarily on factors outside of NYSE Euronexts control, including general economic conditions in Europe and the United States (in particular, stock market conditions) and the success of competing stock exchanges in attracting and retaining listed companies. Technology Services Revenues are generated primarily from connectivity services related to the SFTI and FIX networks, software licenses and maintenance fees as well as consulting services. Colocation revenue is recognized monthly over the life of the contract. We also generate revenues from software license contracts and maintenance agreements. We provide software that allows customers to receive comprehensive market agnostic connectivity, transaction and data management solutions. Software license revenues are recognized at the time of client acceptance and maintenance agreement revenues are recognized monthly over the life of the maintenance term subsequent to acceptance. Consulting services are offered for customization or installation of the software and for general advisory services. Consulting revenue is generally billed in arrears on a time and materials basis, although customers sometimes prepay for blocks of consulting services in bulk. NYSE Euronext records revenues from subscription agreements on a pro rata basis over the life of the subscription agreements. The unrealized portions of invoiced subscription fees, maintenance fees and prepaid consulting fees are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Other Revenues Other revenues include trading license fees, fees for facilities and other services provided to designated market markers (DMMs), brokers and clerks physically located on the floors of our U.S. markets that enable them to engage in the purchase and sale of securities on the trading floor, the revenues of our NYSE Blue joint venture and fees for clearance and settlement activities in our European markets, as well as regulatory revenues. Regulatory fees are charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges. Components of Expenses Section 31 Fees See Sources of Revenues Transaction and Clearing Fees above. 55 Table of Contents Liquidity Payments, Routing and Clearing We offer our customers a variety of liquidity payment structures, tailored to specific market, product and customer characteristics in order to attract order flow, enhance liquidity and promote use of our markets. We charge a per share or per contract execution fee to the market participant who takes the liquidity on certain of our trading platforms and, in turn, we pay, on certain of our markets, a portion of this per share or per contract execution fee to the market participant who provides the liquidity. We also incur routing charges in the U.S. when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our U.S. securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customers order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We include costs incurred due to erroneous trade execution within routing and clearing. Furthermore, NYSE Arca incurs clearance, brokerage and related transaction expenses, which primarily include costs incurred in self clearing activities, and per trade service fees paid to exchanges for trade execution. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses include compensation, depreciation and amortization, systems and communications, professional services, selling, general and administrative, and merger expenses and exit costs. Compensation Compensation expense includes employee salaries, incentive compensation (including stock based compensation) and related benefits expense, including pension, medical, post retirement medical and supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) charges. Part time help, primarily related to security personnel at the NYSE, is also recorded as part of compensation. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of costs from depreciating fixed assets (including computer hardware and capitalized software) and amortizing intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Systems and Communications Systems and communications expense includes costs for development and maintenance of trading, regulatory and administrative systems; investments in system capacity, reliability and security; and cost of network connectivity between our customers and data centers, as well as connectivity to various other market centers. Systems and communications expense also includes fees paid to third party providers of networks and information technology resources, including fees for consulting, research and development services, software rental costs and licenses, hardware rental and related fees paid to third party maintenance providers. Professional Services Professional services expense includes consulting charges related to various technological and operational initiatives, including fees paid to LCH.Clearnet in connection with certain clearing guarantee arrangements and FINRA in connection with the transfer of certain member firm regulatory functions, as well as legal and audit fees. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses include (i) occupancy costs; (ii) marketing costs consisting of advertising, printing and promotion expenses; (iii) insurance premiums, travel and entertainment expenses, co branding, investor education and advertising expenses with NYSE listed companies; (iv) general and administrative expenses; and (v) regulatory fine income levied by NYSE Regulation. Regulatory fine income must be used for regulatory purposes. Subsequent to the July 30, 2007 asset purchase agreement with FINRA, the amount of regulatory fine income has been relatively immaterial. 56 Table of Contents Merger Expenses and Exit Costs Merger expenses and exit costs consist of severance costs and related curtailment losses, contract termination costs, depreciation charges triggered by the acceleration of certain fixed asset useful lives, as well as legal and other professional fees and expenses directly attributable to business combinations and cost reduction initiatives. 57 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2011 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2010 The following table sets forth NYSE Euronexts consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each item for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2010.

This compares to total revenues, less transaction based expenses, operating income and net income attributable to NYSE Euronext of $2,511 million, $745 million and $577 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010. 58 Table of Contents The $161 million increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses, $105 million increase in operating income and $42 million increase in net income attributable to NYSE Euronext for the period reflect the following principal factors: Increased total revenues, less transaction based expenses Total revenues, less transaction based expenses increased primarily due to growth in technology services revenue, strong trading volumes in our European cash and U.S. derivatives businesses and positive foreign currency impact of $56 million. Increased operating income The period over period increase in operating income of $105 million was primarily due to an increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses of $56 million primarily related to legal, investment banking and other professional fees and costs incurred in connection with the terminated Proposed Business Combination with Deutsche B&ouml;rse. Excluding the net impact of merger and exit activities, a tax settlement related to BlueNext ($42 million), the impact of foreign currency ($27 million) and new business initiatives ($31 million), our other operating expenses decreased $70 million or 4% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Increased net income attributable to NYSE Euronext As compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, the period over period increase in net income attributable to NYSE Euronext of $42 million was mainly due to increased operating income and slightly lower effective tax rate. Segment Results We operate under three reportable segments: Derivatives, Cash Trading and Listings, and Information Services and Technology Solutions. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on revenue and operating income. For discussion of these segments, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements and Overview above. % of TotalRevenues Segment Revenues (in millions) 2011 2010 2011 2010 Derivatives $ 1,135 $ 1,088 25 % 25 % Cash Trading and Listings 2,929 2,893 64 % 65 % Information Services and Technology Solutions 490 444 11 % 10 % Total segment revenues $ 4,554 $ 4,425 100 % 100 % Derivatives Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2011 2010 Transaction and clearing fees $ 1,046 $ 1,005 4 % 92 % 93 % Market data 48 47 2 % 4 % 4 % Other revenues 41 36 14 % 4 % 3 % Total revenues 1,135 1,088 4 % 100 % 100 % Transaction based expenses: Liquidity payments, routing and clearing 274 262 5 % 24 % 24 % Total revenues, less transaction based expenses 861 826 4 % 76 % 76 % Merger expenses and exit costs 3 15 (80 )% 1 % 2 % Other operating expenses 388 372 4 % 34 % 34 % Operating income $ 470 $ 439 7 % 41 % 40 % 59 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2011, Derivatives operating income increased $31 million to $470 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our U.S. options trading volume of 20%, improved non transaction based revenues, reduced merger expenses and exit costs and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $16 million), partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses. Cash Trading and Listings Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2011 2010 Transaction and clearing fees $ 2,116 $ 2,123 % 72 % 73 % Market data 193 200 (4 )% 7 % 7 % Listing 446 422 6 % 15 % 15 % Other revenues 174 148 18 % 6 % 5 % Total revenues 2,929 2,893 1 % 100 % 100 % Transaction based expenses: Section 31 fees 371 315 18 % 13 % 11 % Liquidity payments, routing and clearing 1,235 1,337 (8 )% 42 % 46 % Total revenues, less transaction based expenses 1,323 1,241 7 % 45 % 43 % Merger expenses and exit costs 19 56 (66 )% 1 % 2 % Other operating expenses 832 809 3 % 28 % 28 % Operating income $ 472 $ 376 26 % 16 % 13 % For the year ended December 31, 2011, Cash Trading and Listings operating income increased $96 million to $472 million. This was primarily due to an increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses reflecting improved listing fees, an increase in our European cash trading volumes, higher average net revenue capture for U.S. cash equity, and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $10 million). Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 included a $42 million charge incurred in connection with BlueNexts settlement of a tax matter with the French tax authorities of which 40% or $17 million was contributed by Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts (see Noncontrolling Interest). Excluding the impact of the BlueNext tax matter, Cash Trading and Listings other operating expenses decreased $19 million as part of our cost containment initiatives. Information Services and Technology Solutions Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2011 2010 Market data $ 130 $ 126 3 % 27 % 28 % Technology services 360 318 13 % 73 % 72 % Total revenues 490 444 10 % 100 % 100 % Merger expenses and exit costs 4 17 (76 )% 1 % 4 % Other operating expenses 364 355 3 % 74 % 80 % Operating income $ 122 $ 72 69 % 25 % 16 % For the year ended December 31, 2011, Information Services and Technology Solutions operating income increased $50 million to $122 million. The increase was primarily due to the growth of our software business and the increase in our global connectivity fees related to the new data centers in Mahwah and Basildon as well as the 60 Table of Contents favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $4 million), partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses in connection with the run of our data centers, as well as new personnel and consultants to support the growth of our Information Services and Technology Solutions revenues. Corporate/Eliminations Year Ended December 31, (in millions) Increase 2011 2010 (Decrease) Other revenues $ (2 ) $ (100 )% Total revenues (2 ) (100 )% Merger expenses and exit costs 88 100 % Other operating expenses 124 142 (13 )% Operating (loss) income $ (214 ) $ (142 ) 51 % Corporate and eliminations include unallocated costs primarily related to corporate governance, public company expenses, duplicate costs associated with migrating our data centers and costs associated with our pension, SERP and postretirement benefit plans as well as intercompany eliminations of revenues and expenses. The increase in merger expenses and exit costs was mainly due to legal, investment banking and other professional fees and costs incurred in connection with the terminated Proposed Business Combination with Deutsche B&ouml;rse. Non Operating Income and Expenses Interest Expense Interest expense is primarily attributable to the interest expense on the debt incurred in connection with $750 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 1,000 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2015. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources). The increase is primarily a result of the fact that we no longer capitalize a portion of our interest expense for the development of our Mahwah and Basildon data centers which became operational in the second half of 2010. Interest and Investment Income The increase in our average cash and investment balances, reduction of interest rates and foreign currency rates were the primary drivers of the $4 million increase in investment income. Loss From Associates For the year ended December 31, 2011, the increase in loss from associates is primarily due to the impact of the investment in NYPC which was in development stage. Other Income For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a $56 million one time gain on the sale of our equity investment in the National Stock Exchange of India. We did not record any material other income or expense items in the 2011 period. Noncontrolling Interest For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, NYSE Euronext recorded noncontrolling interest loss of $16 million and $19 million, respectively. In 2011, noncontrolling interest loss consisted primarily of (i) the portion of the NYSE Liffe U.S. and NYSE Blue losses not owned by NYSE Euronext, (ii) the noncontrolling interest portion of the BlueNext tax settlement corresponding to Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts 40% pro rata share of such charge, partially offset by (iii) the noncontrolling interest income reflecting the profitability attributable to NYSE Amex Options. In June 2011, we completed the sale of a significant equity interest in NYSE Amex Options to seven external investors. 61 Table of Contents Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, NYSE Euronext provided for income taxes at an estimated tax rate of 17% and 19%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronexts overall effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to a discrete deferred tax benefit related to an enacted reduction in the corporate tax rate in the United Kingdom and higher earnings generated from foreign operations, where the applicable foreign jurisdictions tax rate is lower than the statutory rate. 62 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2010 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 For the year ended December 31, 2009, the results of operations of NYSE Euronext included the results of operations of NYFIX since its acquisition date on November 30, 2009. The following table sets forth NYSE Euronexts consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each item for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2009.

This compares to total revenues, less transaction based expenses, operating income and net income attributable to NYSE Euronext of $2,478 million, $286 million and $219 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $33 million increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses, $459 million increase in operating income and $358 million increase in net income attributable to NYSE Euronext for the period reflect the following principal factors: Increased total revenues, less transaction based expenses Total revenues, less transaction based expenses increased primarily due to increased volumes in our derivatives business and growth in information services and technology solutions offset by decreased volumes in certain U.S. cash trading venues and price changes in our European cash trading venues. See further detailed discussion within each segment analysis. Increased operating income The period over period increase in operating income of $459 million was primarily due to reduced other operating expenses of $426 million mainly associated with a one time NYSE Liffe Clearing payment of $355 million in 2009 and increased total revenues, less transaction based expenses. Excluding net impact of merger and acquisition activity ($54 million), the impact of foreign currency ($19 million), new business initiatives ($35 million) and data center integration costs ($45 million), our other operating expenses decreased $113 million or 7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Increased net income attributable to NYSE Euronext As compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, the period over period increase in net income attributable to NYSE Euronext of $358 million was mainly due to increased operating income and a $56 million one time gain on the sale of our 5% equity interest in the National Stock Exchange of India, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Segment Results We revised our reportable business segments effective in the first quarter of 2010. The new segments are Derivatives, Cash Trading and Listings, and Information Services and Technology Solutions. Historical financial results have been revised to reflect this change. For discussion of these segments, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements and Overview above. % of TotalRevenues Segment Revenues (in millions) 2010 2009 2010 2009 Derivatives $ 1,088 $ 918 25 % 20 % Cash Trading and Listings 2,893 3,397 65 % 73 % Information Services and Technology Solutions 444 363 10 % 7 % Total segment revenues $ 4,425 $ 4,678 100 % 100 % 64 Table of Contents Derivatives Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2010 2009 Transaction and clearing fees $ 1,005 $ 845 19 % 93 % 92 % Market data 47 42 12 % 4 % 5 % Other revenues 36 31 16 % 3 % 3 % Total revenues 1,088 918 19 % 100 % 100 % Transaction based expenses: Liquidity payments, routing and clearing 262 195 34 % 24 % 21 % Total revenues, less transaction based expenses 826 723 14 % 76 % 79 % Merger expenses and exit costs 15 382 (96 )% 2 % 42 % Other operating expenses 372 381 (2 )% 34 % 41 % Operating income (loss) $ 439 $ (40 ) NM 40 % (4 )% NM Not meaningful. For the year ended December 31, 2010, Derivatives operating income increased $479 million to $439 million. The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses reflecting an increase in our European average daily volume of 14.8% as compared to the same period a year ago, (ii) the inclusion of the full year results of NYSE Liffe Clearing in 2010, (iii) an increase in our U.S. options market share, (iv) reduced merger expenses and exit costs which included a one time NYSE Liffe Clearing payment of $355 million in 2009 and (v) a $9 million decrease of other operating expenses reflecting the results of operating efficiencies, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $10 million). Cash Trading and Listings Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2010 2009 Transaction and clearing fees $ 2,123 $ 2,582 (18 )% 73 % 76 % Market data 200 221 (10 )% 7 % 7 % Listing 422 407 4 % 15 % 12 % Other revenues 148 187 (21 )% 5 % 5 % Total revenues 2,893 3,397 (15 )% 100 % 100 % Transaction based expenses: Section 31 fees 315 388 (19 )% 11 % 11 % Liquidity payments, routing and clearing 1,337 1,623 (18 )% 46 % 48 % Total revenues, less transaction based expenses 1,241 1,386 (10 )% 43 % 41 % Merger expenses and exit costs 56 104 (46 )% 2 % 3 % Other operating expenses 809 867 (7 )% 28 % 26 % Operating income $ 376 $ 415 (9 )% 13 % 12 % 65 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2010, Cash Trading and Listings operating income decreased $39 million to $376 million. This was primarily due to a $145 million decrease in total revenues, less transaction based expenses. Our U.S. venues average daily volume experienced a 20.9% decline while improving revenue capture. Our European venues had an increase in average daily volume of 6.8% and deteriorated, yet stabilized by year end, revenue capture. The decline in our total revenues, less transaction based expenses was partially offset by reduced levels of merger expenses and exit costs as well as a $58 million decrease of other operating expenses as part of our cost containment initiatives. Information Services and Technology Solutions Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2010 2009 Market data $ 126 $ 140 (10 )% 28 % 39 % Technology services 318 223 43 % 72 % 61 % Total revenues 444 363 22 % 100 % 100 % Merger expenses and exit costs 17 27 (37 )% 4 % 7 % Other operating expenses 355 309 15 % 80 % 85 % Operating income $ 72 $ 27 167 % 16 % 8 % For the year ended December 31, 2010, Information Services and Technology Solutions operating income increased $45 million to $72 million. The increase was primarily due to the growth of our software business and the inclusion of the full year results of NYFIX in 2010, a business acquired on November 30, 2009. Corporate/Eliminations Year Ended December 31, (in millions) Increase 2010 2009 (Decrease) Other revenues $ $ 6 (100 )% Total revenues 6 (100 )% Merger expenses and exit costs 3 (100 )% Other operating expenses 142 119 19 % Operating (loss) income $ (142 ) $ (116 ) 22 % Corporate and eliminations include unallocated costs primarily related to corporate governance, public company expenses, duplicate costs associated with migrating our data centers and costs associated with our pension, SERP and postretirement benefit plans as well as intercompany eliminations of revenues and expenses. The increase in other operating expenses is mainly due to increased data center migration costs. Non Operating Income and Expenses Interest Expense Interest expense is primarily attributable to the interest expense on the debt incurred in connection with $750 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 1,000 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2015. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources). The reduction in interest expense is primarily driven by lower outstanding debt balances. Interest and Investment Income The decrease in our average cash and investment balances, reduction of interest rates and foreign currency rates were the primary drivers of the $8 million decrease in investment income. 66 Table of Contents Income (Loss) From Associates For the year ended December 31, 2010, the decrease in income (loss) from associates is primarily due to the impact of the investment in NYPC which was in development stage. Other Income For the year ended December 31, 2010, other income increased $27 million to $55 million as compared to the same period a year ago. The increase is primarily due to a $56 million gain on the sale of our equity investment in the National Stock Exchange of India, partially offset by foreign exchange gains and losses and dividends on certain investments, which may vary period over period. Noncontrolling Interest For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, NYSE Euronext recorded noncontrolling interest loss of $19 million and $7 million, respectively. The increase of $12 million in noncontrolling interest loss year over year primarily reflects the reduced profitability of NYSE Blue and the operating losses of NYSE Liffe U.S., which was in development stage. Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, NYSE Euronext provided for income taxes at an estimated tax rate of 19% and benefited from income taxes at an estimated tax rate of 3%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010, NYSE Euronexts overall effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to lower tax rates on its foreign operations, the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and a discrete deferred tax benefit related to an enacted reduction in the corporate tax rate in both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Liquidity and Capital Resources NYSE Euronexts financial policy seeks to finance the growth of its business, remunerate shareholders and ensure financial flexibility, while maintaining strong creditworthiness and liquidity. NYSE Euronexts primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, current assets and existing bank facilities. NYSE Euronexts principal liquidity requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate use. Cash Flows For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,000 million, representing primarily net income of $603 million, depreciation and amortization of $286 million, partially offset by a positive change in working capital of $206 million. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $170 million. Under the terms of the operating agreement of the NYSE, no regulatory fees, fines or penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be distributed to NYSE Euronext or any entity other than NYSE Regulation. As a result, the use of regulatory fees, fines and penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be considered restricted. As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext did not have significant restricted cash balances. Net Financial Indebtedness As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext had approximately $2.1 billion in debt outstanding and $0.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and financial investments, resulting in $1.7 billion in net indebtedness. We define net indebtedness as outstanding debt less cash, cash equivalents and financial investments. 67 Table of Contents Net indebtedness was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 396 $ 327 Financial investments 36 52 Cash, cash equivalents and financial investments [a] $ 432 $ 379 Short term debt 39 366 Long term debt 2,036 2,074 Total debt [b] $ 2,075 $ 2,440 Net indebtedness [b] [a] $ 1,643 $ 2,061 Cash, cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronexts main debt instruments were as follows (in millions): PrincipalAmount Maturity 4.8% bond in U.S. dollar $750 June 30, 2013 5.375% bond in Euro 1,000($1,296) June 30, 2015 In 2007, NYSE Euronext entered into a U.S. dollar and euro denominated global commercial paper program of $3.0 billion in order to refinance the acquisition of the Euronext shares. As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext had no debt outstanding under this commercial paper program. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (Libor U.S. for commercial paper issued in U.S. dollar and Euribor for commercial paper issued in euro). The fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may therefore impact the interest expense incurred by NYSE Euronext. The commercial paper program is backed by a $1.4 billion syndicated revolving bank facility maturing on July 31, 2012. This bank facility is also available for general corporate purposes and was not drawn as of December 31, 2011. This bank facility was initially entered into in 2007 for an amount of $2.0 billion and was subsequently amended on December 8, 2011. Pursuant to the amendment, the size of the facility decreased to $1,357 million as of December 8, 2011 and will further decrease to $1.2 billion as of April 4, 2012. In August 2006, prior to the combination with NYSE Group, Euronext entered into a 300 million revolving credit facility available for general corporate purposes, which matured on August 4, 2011. The commercial paper program and the credit facilities include terms and conditions customary for agreements of this type, which may restrict NYSE Euronexts ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness In 2008, NYSE Euronext issued $750 million of 4.8% fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 750 million of 5.375% fixed rate bonds due in June 2015 in order to, among other things, refinance outstanding commercial paper and lengthen the maturity profile of its debt. In 2009, NYSE Euronext increased the 750 million 5.375% notes due in June 2015 to 1 billion as a result of an incremental offering of 250 million. The terms of the bonds do not contain any financial covenants. The bonds may be redeemed by NYSE Euronext or the bond holders under certain customary circumstances, including a change in control accompanied by a downgrade of the bonds below an investment grade rating. The terms of the bonds also provide for customary events of default and a negative pledge covenant. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all of our debt instruments covenants in all material respects. Liquidity Risk NYSE Euronext continually reviews its liquidity and debt positions, and subject to market conditions and credit and strategic considerations, may from time to time determine to vary the maturity profile of its debt and 68 Table of Contents diversify its sources of financing. NYSE Euronext anticipates being able to support short term liquidity and operating needs primarily through existing cash balances and financing arrangements, along with future cash flows from operations. If existing financing arrangements are insufficient to meet anticipated needs or to refinance existing debt, NYSE Euronext may seek additional financing in either the debt or equity markets. NYSE Euronext may also seek equity or debt financing in connection with future acquisitions or other strategic transactions. While we believe that we generally have access to debt markets, including bank facilities and publicly and privately issued long and short term debt, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. Because new issues of commercial paper generally fund the retirement of outstanding issues, NYSE Euronext is also exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to refinance outstanding commercial paper. In order to mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain backstop bank facilities for an aggregate amount exceeding at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program. In the event that we are unable to issue new commercial paper, we may draw on these backstop facilities. Share Repurchase Program In 2008, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our common stock. Under the program, we may repurchase stock from time to time at the discretion of management in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to applicable United States or European laws, regulations and approvals, strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors. This stock repurchase plan does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of our common stock and any such repurchases will be made in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations, including rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable EU regulations and regulations of the AMF. A summary of common stock purchases is as follows: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Period Total Number ofShares Purchased AveragePrice PaidPer Share Total Number of SharesPurchased as Part ofPublicly AnnouncedPlans or Programs Approximate DollarValue of Shares thatMay Yet BePurchased Under thePlans or Programs $ 1,000 2008 13,363,661 $ 26.04 13,363,661 652 2009/2010 13,363,661 652 2011(1) 3,712,261 26.96 17,075,922 552 17,075,922 (1) All shares were repurchased during the month of November 2011. 69 Table of Contents Summary Disclosures About Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes NYSE Euronexts debt, future minimum lease obligations on its operating leases and other commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): Payments Due by Year(1) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Debt (principal and accrued interest obligations) $ 2,075 $ 39 $ 749 $ $ 1,287 $ $ Debt (future interest obligations) 298 70 88 70 70 Operating lease obligations 345 63 58 51 42 25 106 Other commitments(2) 77 40 37 $ 2,795 $ 212 $ 932 $ 121 $ 1,399 $ 25 $ 106 (1) As of December 31, 2011, obligations under capital leases were not significant. NYSE Euronext also has obligations related to other post retirement benefits, deferred compensation and unrecognized tax positions. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined. See Notes 7 Pension and Other Benefit Programs, 9 Stock Based Compensation, and 15 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, the external investors in our NYSE Amex Options market have received an equity instrument which is tied to their individual contribution to the options exchanges success and have the option to require NYSE Euronext to repurchase a portion of the instruments on an annual basis over the course of five years starting in 2011. The amount NYSE Euronext is required to purchase under this arrangement is capped each year at between 5% and 15% of the total outstanding shares of NYSE Amex Options. NYSE Euronext recognized the full redemption value, i.e. fair value, of this instrument as mezzanine equity and classified the related balance as Redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2011. However, NYSE Euronext cannot predict whether the external investors will elect to exercise their put option. (2) Primarily reflects the outstanding commitment for our investment in the Qatar Exchange. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following provides information about NYSE Euronexts critical accounting policies and estimates. Critical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially produce materially different results, assumptions and conditions. Revenue Recognition There are two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our exchanges listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate actions. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are not applicable to companies when they list on the NYSE or NYSE Arca in the context of a transfer from another market. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares. Annual fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original listing fees are recognized on a straight line basis over their estimated service periods of 10 years for NYSE and Euronext, and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, NYSE Euronext, through NYSE Technologies Trading Solutions business, licenses software and provides software services which are accounted for in accordance with Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic of the Codifications. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets NYSE Euronext reviews the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based upon estimated fair value of NYSE Euronexts reporting units. Should the review indicate that goodwill is impaired, 70 Table of Contents NYSE Euronexts goodwill would be reduced by the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its fair value. NYSE Euronext reviews the useful life of its indefinite lived intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life categorization. In addition, the carrying value of NYSE Euronexts indefinite lived intangible assets is reviewed by NYSE Euronext at least annually for impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the asset. For purposes of performing the impairment test, fair values are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which, among other factors, is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long term rate of growth for businesses, and determination of weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill and other intangible impairment for each reporting unit. Income Taxes NYSE Euronext records income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and tax bases in assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided for certain tax carryforwards. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. NYSE Euronext is subject to tax regulations in numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions primarily based on its operations in these jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in NYSE Euronexts financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could have material impact on NYSE Euronexts financial position or results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Employee Benefits Pension and Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates to measure future obligation and interest expense, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates and other factors. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect NYSE Euronexts pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense. Hedging Activities NYSE Euronext uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. NYSE Euronext accounts for derivatives pursuant to the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Codification. The Derivatives and Hedging Topic establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires that all derivatives be recorded at fair value on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in other comprehensive income or net income depending on whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in cash flows or changes in fair value. Recently Issued Accounting Guidance The FASB issued ASU 2011 05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, and ASU 2011 12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other 71 Table of Contents Comprehensive Income in ASU 2011 05, which amend certain provisions in Subtopic 220 10 in the Comprehensive Income Topic of the Codification. The amendments in ASU 2011 05 require that the net income and other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income. The ASU 2011 05 also requires reclassification of other comprehensive income components to be presented in the face of the income statement as well as in the face of the statement of comprehensive income. The amendments in ASU 2011 05 do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The amendments also do not change the option for an entity to present components of other comprehensive income either net of related tax effects or before related tax effects, with one amount shown for the aggregate income tax expense or benefit related to the total of other comprehensive income items. In both cases, the tax effect for each component must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements or presented in the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. However, the ASU 2011 12 postponed the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in ASU 2011 05. Both ASU 2011 05 and ASU 2011 12 amendments should be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. NYSE Euronext adopted these provisions in 2011, and they did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued ASU 2011 08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which amends certain provisions in Subtopic 350 20 in the Intangibles Goodwill and Other Topic of the Codification. The amendments in ASU 2011 08 provide changes to the goodwill impairment guidance that are intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual impairment test. The changes allow entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The new qualitative indicators replace those currently used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required. In addition, the indicators will be applicable for assessing whether to perform step two for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. These amendments will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. We do not believe that this will have a significant impact on our financial statements. The FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009 13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, which supersedes certain provisions in Subtopic 25 in the Revenue Recognition Topic of the Codification. ASU 2009 13 requires an entity to allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices. It also eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation which was allowed under previous guidance and requires the use of the relative selling price method in all circumstances in which an entity recognizes revenue for an arrangement with multiple deliverable subject to the Subtopic 25 in the Revenue Recognition Topic. ASU 2009 13 also requires both ongoing disclosures regarding an entitys multiple element revenue arrangements as well as certain transitional disclosures during periods after adoption. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We adopted this as of January 1, 2011, and the adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. The FASB issued ASU 2009 14, Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements, which amends certain provisions in Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic of the Codification. The amendments in ASU 2009 14 change revenue recognition for tangible products containing software elements and non software elements as follows: (1) the tangible element of the product is always outside the scope of Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic; (2) the software elements of tangible products are outside of the scope of Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic when the software elements and non software elements function together to deliver the products essential functionality and (3) undelivered elements in the arrangement related to the non software components also are excluded from the software revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2009 14 applies to transactions which contain both software and non software elements. For these transactions, companies will have to go through a two step process for the software elements. First, a company has to allocate the total consideration to separate units of account for the non software elements and software elements as a group, using relative selling price 72 Table of Contents method. Second, the amount allocated to the software elements as a group will then be accounted for in accordance with the requirements in Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic of the Codification. This may require the use of Residual Method of allocation if VSOE (vendor specific objective evidence) or TPE (third party evidence) does not exist for the undelivered elements. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, and it is also applicable to existing arrangements that are materially modified after the effective date. We adopted this as of January 1, 2011, and the adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK General As a result of its operating and financing activities, NYSE Euronext is exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, currency risk and credit risk. NYSE Euronext has implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. NYSE Euronexts central treasury is charged with identifying risk exposures and monitoring and managing such risks on a daily basis. To the extent permitted by local regulation and necessary, NYSE Euronexts subsidiaries centralize their cash investments, report their risks and hedge their exposures with the central treasury. NYSE Euronext performs sensitivity analyses to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have. NYSE Euronext uses derivative instruments solely to hedge financial risks related to its financial positions or risks that are otherwise incurred in the normal course of its commercial activities. It does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Except for fixed rate bonds, most of NYSE Euronexts financial assets and liabilities are based on floating rates, on fixed rates with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in less than one year or on fixed rates that have been swapped to floating rates via fixed to floating rate swaps. The following table summarizes NYSE Euronexts exposure to interest rate risk as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): FinancialAssets FinancialLiabilities NetExposure Impact(2) of a100 bpsAdverse Shift inInterest Rates(3) Floating rate(1) positions in Dollar $ 162 $ 4 $ 158 $ (1.6 ) Euro 31 35 (4 ) (0.1 ) Sterling 204 204 (2.0 ) Fixed rate positions in Dollar 749 (749 ) (11.3 ) Euro 1,287 (1,287 ) (43.2 ) Sterling (1) Includes floating rate, fixed rate with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in less than one year and fixed rate swapped to floating rate. (2) Impact on profit and loss for floating rate positions (cash flow risk) and on equity until realization in profit and loss for fixed rate positions (price risk). (3) 100 basis points parallel shift of yield curve. 73 Table of Contents NYSE Euronext is exposed to price risk on its outstanding fixed rate positions. As of December 31, 2011, fixed rate positions in U.S. dollar and in euro with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in more than one year amounted to $749 million and $1,287 million, respectively. A hypothetical shift of 1% in the U.S. dollar or in the euro interest rate curves would in the aggregate impact the fair value of these positions by $11.3 million and $43.2 million, respectively. NYSE Euronext is exposed to cash flow risk on its floating rate positions. Because NYSE Euronext is a net lender in U.S. dollar and sterling, when interest rates in U.S. dollar or sterling decrease, NYSE Euronexts net interest and investment income decreases. Based on December 31, 2011 positions, a hypothetical 1% decrease in U.S. dollar or sterling rates would negatively impact annual income by $1.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. Because NYSE Euronext is a net borrower in euro, when interest rates in euro increase, NYSE Euronext net interest and investment income decreases. Based on December 31, 2011 positions, a hypothetical 1% increase in euro rates would negatively impact annual income by less than $0.1 million. Currency Risk As an international group, NYSE Euronext is subject to currency translation risk. A significant part of NYSE Euronexts assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses is recorded in euro and sterling. Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. NYSE Euronexts exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (in millions, except average rates): Euro Sterling Average rate in the period $ 1.3923 $ 1.6040 Average rate in the same period one year before $ 1.3269 $ 1.5457 Foreign denominated percentage of Revenues 17 % 15 % Operating expenses 10 % 14 % Operating income 46 % 20 % Impact of the currency fluctuations(1) on Revenues 35.6 25.9 Operating expenses 15.6 18.8 Operating income 20.0 7.1 (1) Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year. 74 Table of Contents NYSE Euronexts exposure to net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions): December 31,2011 Position in Position in Euros Sterling Assets 3,899 &pound; 2,680 of which goodwill 1,043 1,072 Liabilities 2,000 396 of which borrowings 1,018 Net currency position before hedging activities 1,899 2,284 Impact of hedging activities 268 209 Net currency position 2,167 &pound; 2,493 Impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates $ (281 ) $ (387 ) As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext was exposed to net exposures in euro and sterling of 2.2 billion ($2.8 billion) and &pound;2.5 billion ($3.9 billion), respectively. NYSE Euronexts borrowings in euro of 1.0 billion ($1.3 billion) constitute a partial hedge of NYSE Euronexts net investments in foreign entities. As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext also had 268 million ($348 million) Euro/dollar and &pound;209 million ($325 million) sterling/dollar foreign exchange swaps outstanding. These swaps matured during January 2012. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of these swaps was a $1 million net liability. Based on December 31, 2011 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of the euro against the dollar would negatively impacted NYSE Euronexts equity by $281 million and a hypothetical 10% decrease of the sterling against the dollar would negatively impacted NYSE Euronexts equity by $387 million. For the year ended December 31, 2011, currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of $133 million on NYSE Euronexts consolidated equity. Credit Risk NYSE Euronext is exposed to credit risk in the event of a counterparty default. NYSE Euronext limits its exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which it makes investments and executes agreements. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. NYSE Euronexts investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. NYSE Euronext seeks to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties. An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, NYSE Euronexts policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk. Derivatives are negotiated with highly rated banks. 75 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements. Actual results may differ from such forward looking statements. See Item 1A Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. Certain prior period amounts presented in the discussion and analysis have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Overview NYSE Euronext was formed from the combination of the businesses of NYSE Group and Euronext, which was consummated on April 4, 2007. Following consummation of the combination, NYSE Euronext became the parent company of NYSE Group and Euronext and each of their respective subsidiaries. Under the purchase method of accounting, NYSE Group was treated as the accounting and legal acquirer in the combination with Euronext. On October 1, 2008, NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of The Amex Membership Corporation, including its subsidiary the American Stock Exchange, which is now known as NYSE Amex. NYSE Euronext operates under three reportable segments: Derivatives, Cash Trading and Listings, and Information Services and Technology Solutions. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on revenue and operating income. We have aggregated all of our corporate costs, including the costs to operate as a public company, within Corporate/ Eliminations. The following is a description of our reportable segments: Derivatives consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts global businesses: providing access to trade execution in derivatives products, options and futures; providing certain clearing services for derivatives products; and selling and distributing market data and related information. Cash Trading and Listings consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts global businesses: providing access to trade execution in cash trading; providing settlement of transactions in certain European markets; obtaining new listings and servicing existing listings; selling and distributing market data and related information; and providing regulatory services. Information Services and Technology Solutions consist of the following in NYSE Euronexts global businesses: operating sell side and buy side connectivity networks for our markets and for other major market centers and market participants in the United States, Europe and Asia; providing trading and information technology software and solutions; selling and distributing market data and related information to data subscribers for proprietary data products; and providing multi asset managed services and expert consultancy to exchanges and liquidity centers. For a discussion of these segments, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents Factors Affecting Our Results The business environment in which NYSE Euronext operates directly affects its results of operations. Our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors, including the level of trading activity in our markets, which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions, competition, market share and the pace of industry consolidation; broad trends in the brokerage and finance industry; price levels and price volatility; the number and financial health of companies listed on NYSE Euronexts cash markets; changing technology in the financial services industry; and legislative and regulatory changes, among other factors. See Item 1A Risk Factors. In particular, in recent years, the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants demand for speed, capacity and reliability, which requires continuing investment in technology; and increasing competition for market data revenues. The maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing. Uncertainty in the U.S. credit markets that commenced with the upheaval in 2008 continues to impact the economy. Equity market indices have experienced volatility and the market may remain volatile throughout 2012. Economic uncertainty in the European Union and the political upheaval in certain North African countries could spread to other countries and may continue to negatively affect global financial markets. While markets may improve, these factors have adversely affected our revenues and operating income and may negatively impact future growth. As a result of recent events, there has been, and it is likely that there will continue to be, significant change in the regulatory environment in which we operate. In particular, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law in July 2010. Although many of its provisions require the adoption of rules to implement, and it contains substantial ambiguities, many of which will not be resolved until regulations are adopted, such reforms could adversely affect our business or result in increased costs and the expenditure of significant resources. In addition, there are significant structural changes underway within the European regulatory framework. See Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Relating to Regulation We may be adversely affected by the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; We may be adversely affected by significant proposed European Union financial reforms; Changes to the regulators and agencies governing European financial markets could adversely affect our business. While we have not experienced reductions in our borrowing capacity, lenders in general have taken actions that indicate their concerns regarding liquidity in the marketplace. These actions have included reduced advance rates for certain security types, more stringent requirements for collateral eligibility and higher interest rates. Should lenders continue to take additional similar actions, the cost of conducting our business may increase and our ability to implement our business initiatives could be limited. We expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our businesses. Any potential growth in the global cash markets will likely be tempered by investor uncertainty resulting from volatility in the cost of energy and commodities, unemployment concerns, contagion concerns in relation to the sovereign debt issues faced by some members of the Eurozone, as well as the general state of the world economy. We continue to focus on our strategy to broaden and diversify our revenue streams, as well as our company wide expense reduction initiatives in order to mitigate these uncertainties. Recent Acquisitions and Other Transactions NYSE Amex Options On June 29, 2011, NYSE Euronext completed the sale of a significant equity interest in NYSE Amex Options, one of our two U.S. options exchanges, to seven external investors, BofA Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital, Citadel Securities, Citi, Goldman Sachs, TD AMERITRADE and UBS. NYSE Euronext remains the largest shareholder in the entity and manages the day to day operations of NYSE Amex Options, which operates under the supervision of a separate board of directors and a dedicated chief executive officer. NYSE Euronext consolidates this entity for financial reporting purposes. 51 Table of Contents As part of the agreement, the external investors have received an equity instrument which is tied to their individual contribution to the options exchanges success. Under the terms of the agreement, the external investors have the option to require NYSE Euronext to repurchase a portion of the instruments on an annual basis over the course of five years starting in 2011. The amount NYSE Euronext is required to purchase under this arrangement is capped each year at between approximately 5% and 15% of the total outstanding shares of NYSE Amex Options. On September 16, 2011, the external investors put back approximately 5% of the total outstanding shares of NYSE Amex Options to NYSE Euronext. NYSE Euronext recognized the full redemption value, i.e. fair value, of this instrument as mezzanine equity and classified the related balance as Redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2011. NYSE BlueTM On February 18, 2011, the formation of the NYSE Blue joint venture was consummated. NYSE Blue is a new global company that is majority owned by NYSE Euronext. NYSE Blue consists of the businesses of APX (headquartered in the New York City region) and BlueNext (headquartered in Paris). In its environmental unit, NYSE Blue provides infrastructure and services to environmental sponsors and market participants, through its environmental management account for asset and risk management as well as its registry services for renewable energy in the United States and voluntary carbon credits worldwide. Additionally, NYSE Blue operates, through BlueNext, a leading spot exchange for the European Emissions Trading System, a multi country, multi sector greenhouse gas emission trading scheme. In its power unit, NYSE Blue is a leading provider of hosted power scheduling and settlement services for wholesale power market participants. NYSE Euronext consolidates NYSE Blue for financial reporting purposes. New York Portfolio Clearing NYPC, NYSE Euronexts joint venture with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), became operational in the first quarter of 2011. NYPC currently clears fixed income futures traded on NYSE Liffe US and will have the ability to provide clearing services for other exchanges and Derivatives Clearing Organizations in the future. NYPC uses NYSE Euronexts clearing technology, TRS/CPS, to process and manage cleared positions and post trade position transfers. DTCCs Fixed Income Clearing Corporation provides capabilities in risk management, settlement, banking and reference data systems. As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext had a minority ownership interest in, and board representation on, DTCC. NYSE Euronext has agreed to make up to a $50 million financial guarantee as an additional contribution to the NYPC default fund, of which $25 million had been contributed as of December 31, 2011, and was held in escrow by NYPC. NYSE Euronexts investment in NYPC is treated as an equity method investment. Sale of American Stock Exchange building In the first quarter of 2011, the American Stock Exchange building (Amex building) was sold and, in accordance with the Amex acquisition agreement, approximately 340,000 NYSE Euronext shares of common stock were issued to former Amex members in June 2011. The issuance of shares represents the final consideration due to former Amex shareholders as part of the Amex acquisition agreement. National Stock Exchange of India On May 3, 2010, NYSE Euronext completed the sale of its 5% equity interest in the National Stock Exchange of India for gross proceeds of $175 million. A $56 million gain was included in Other income in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 as a result of this transaction. Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Assets Testing Methodology and Valuation Considerations Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable assets of a business acquired. In accordance with the Intangibles Goodwill and Other Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification), we test goodwill of our reporting units (which is generally one level below our three reportable segments) and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or 52 Table of Contents circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. We perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter. The impairment test of goodwill is performed in two steps. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In determining the fair value of our reporting units in step one of the goodwill impairment test, we compute the present value of discounted cash flows and terminal value projected for the reporting unit. The rate used to discount cash flows represents the weighted average cost of capital that we believe is reflective of the relevant risk associated with the projected cash flows. To validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of the reporting units determined in step one of the goodwill impairment test to the enterprise value of NYSE Euronext to derive the implied control premium. In performing this reconciliation, we may, depending on the volatility of our stock price, use either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, generally 30 days. We compare the implied control premium to premiums paid in observable recent transactions of comparable companies to determine if the fair value of the reporting units estimated in step one of the goodwill impairment test is reasonable. In accordance with Subtopic 10 in the Property, Plant, and Equipment Topic of the Codification, impairment exists when the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from it. An intangible asset subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of the intangible asset, indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment on matters such as, but not limited to, the reporting unit at which goodwill should be measured for impairment, future operating performance and cash flows, cost of capital, terminal values, control premiums, remaining economic lives of assets, and the allocation of shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, in order to determine whether a decline in the value of certain securities and other investments is other than temporary, we evaluate, among other factors, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost. In particular, we consider the impact of duration and severity on the period of time expected for recovery to occur. If we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary, we write down the carrying value of the related asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we did not record any material impairment charge. Sources of Revenues Transaction and Clearing Fees Our transaction and clearing fees consist of fees collected from our cash trading, derivatives trading and clearing businesses. Cash trading. Revenues for cash trading consist of transaction charges for executing trades on our cash markets, as well as transaction charges related to orders on our U.S. cash markets which are routed to other market centers for execution. Additionally, our U.S. cash markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. These fees are designed to recover the costs to the government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. Activity assessment fees are 53 Table of Contents collected from member organizations executing trades on our U.S. cash markets, and are recognized when these amounts are invoiced. Fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and Section 31 fees do not have an impact on NYSE Euronexts net income. Derivatives trading and clearing. Revenues from derivatives trading and clearing consist of per contract fees for executing trades of derivatives contracts and clearing charges on the London market of NYSE Liffe and NYSE Liffe US and executing options contracts traded on NYSE Liffes continental Europe derivatives markets, NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. In some cases, these fees are subject to caps. Revenues for per contract fees are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract. The principal types of derivative contracts traded and cleared are equity and index products and short term interest rate products. Trading in equity products is primarily driven by price volatility in equity markets and indices and trading in short term interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from uncertainty over the direction of short term interest rates. The level of trading and clearing activity for all products is also influenced by market conditions and other factors. See Factors Affecting Our Results. Market Data We generate revenues from the dissemination of our market data in the U.S. and Europe to a variety of users. In the U.S., we collect market data fees principally for consortium based data products and, to a lesser extent, for NYSE proprietary data products. Consortium based data fees are dictated as part of the securities industry plans and charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. Consortium based data revenues from the dissemination of market data (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of a formula set by the SEC under Regulation NMS. Last sale prices and quotes in NYSE listed, NYSE Amex listed, and NYSE Arca listed securities are disseminated through Tape A and Tape B, which constitute the majority of the NYSE Euronexts U.S. revenues from consortium based market data revenues. We also receive a share of the revenues from Tape C, which represents data related to trading of certain securities that are listed on Nasdaq. These revenues are influenced by demand for the data by professional and nonprofessional subscribers. In addition, we receive fees for the display of data on television and for vendor access. Our proprietary products make market data available to subscribers covering activity that takes place solely on our U.S. markets, independent of activity on other markets. Our proprietary data products also include depth of book information, historical price information and corporate action information. NYSE Euronext offers NYSE Realtime Reference Prices, which allows internet and media organizations to buy real time, last sale market data from NYSE and provide it broadly and free of charge to the public. CNBC, Google Finance and nyse.com display NYSE Realtime stock prices on their respective websites. In Europe, we charge a variety of users, primarily the end users, for the use of Euronexts real time market data services. We also collect annual license fees from vendors for the right to distribute Euronext market data to third parties and a service fee from vendors for direct connection to market data. A substantial majority of European market data revenues is derived from monthly end user fees. We also derive revenues from selling historical and reference data about securities, and by publishing the daily official lists for the Euronext markets. The principal drivers of market data revenues are the number of end users and the prices for data packages. Listing There are two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our U.S. and European securities exchanges listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate related actions. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are generally not applicable to companies that transfer to one of our U.S. securities exchanges from another market, except for companies transferring to NYSE Amex from the over the counter market. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be listed, such as stock splits, rights issues, sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee. 54 Table of Contents In the U.S., annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of the listed U.S. company at the end of the prior year. Non U.S. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the United States. Annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original fees are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over estimated service periods of ten years for the NYSE and the Euronext cash equities markets and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Listing fees for our European markets comprise admission fees paid by issuers to list securities on the cash market, annual fees paid by companies whose financial instruments are listed on the cash market, and corporate activity and other fees, consisting primarily of fees charged by Euronext Paris and Euronext Lisbon for centralizing shares in IPOs and tender offers. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the market capitalization at the time of the IPO. Revenues from annual listing fees relate to the number of shares outstanding and the market capitalization of the listed company. In general, Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels and Euronext Lisbon have adopted a common set of listing fees. Under the harmonized fee book, domestic issuers (i.e., those from France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal) pay admission fees to list their securities based on the market capitalization of the respective issuer. Subsequent listings of securities receive a discount on admission fees. Domestic issuers also pay annual fees based on the number of equity securities and the market capitalization of the respective issuer. Non domestic companies listing in connection with raising capital are charged admission and annual fees on a similar basis, although they are generally charged lower maximum admission fees and annual fees. Non domestic companies that are in the Euronext 100 index are treated as domestic. Euronext Paris and Euronext Lisbon also charge centralization fees for collecting and allocating retail investor orders in IPOs and tender offers. The revenue NYSE Euronext derives from listing fees is primarily dependent on the number and size of new company listings as well as the level of other corporate related activity of existing listed issuers. The number and size of new company listings and other corporate related activity in any period depend primarily on factors outside of NYSE Euronexts control, including general economic conditions in Europe and the United States (in particular, stock market conditions) and the success of competing stock exchanges in attracting and retaining listed companies. Technology Services Revenues are generated primarily from connectivity services related to the SFTI and FIX networks, software licenses and maintenance fees as well as consulting services. Colocation revenue is recognized monthly over the life of the contract. We also generate revenues from software license contracts and maintenance agreements. We provide software that allows customers to receive comprehensive market agnostic connectivity, transaction and data management solutions. Software license revenues are recognized at the time of client acceptance and maintenance agreement revenues are recognized monthly over the life of the maintenance term subsequent to acceptance. Consulting services are offered for customization or installation of the software and for general advisory services. Consulting revenue is generally billed in arrears on a time and materials basis, although customers sometimes prepay for blocks of consulting services in bulk. NYSE Euronext records revenues from subscription agreements on a pro rata basis over the life of the subscription agreements. The unrealized portions of invoiced subscription fees, maintenance fees and prepaid consulting fees are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Other Revenues Other revenues include trading license fees, fees for facilities and other services provided to designated market markers (DMMs), brokers and clerks physically located on the floors of our U.S. markets that enable them to engage in the purchase and sale of securities on the trading floor, the revenues of our NYSE Blue joint venture and fees for clearance and settlement activities in our European markets, as well as regulatory revenues. Regulatory fees are charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges. Components of Expenses Section 31 Fees See Sources of Revenues Transaction and Clearing Fees above. 55 Table of Contents Liquidity Payments, Routing and Clearing We offer our customers a variety of liquidity payment structures, tailored to specific market, product and customer characteristics in order to attract order flow, enhance liquidity and promote use of our markets. We charge a per share or per contract execution fee to the market participant who takes the liquidity on certain of our trading platforms and, in turn, we pay, on certain of our markets, a portion of this per share or per contract execution fee to the market participant who provides the liquidity. We also incur routing charges in the U.S. when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our U.S. securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customers order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We include costs incurred due to erroneous trade execution within routing and clearing. Furthermore, NYSE Arca incurs clearance, brokerage and related transaction expenses, which primarily include costs incurred in self clearing activities, and per trade service fees paid to exchanges for trade execution. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses include compensation, depreciation and amortization, systems and communications, professional services, selling, general and administrative, and merger expenses and exit costs. Compensation Compensation expense includes employee salaries, incentive compensation (including stock based compensation) and related benefits expense, including pension, medical, post retirement medical and supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) charges. Part time help, primarily related to security personnel at the NYSE, is also recorded as part of compensation. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of costs from depreciating fixed assets (including computer hardware and capitalized software) and amortizing intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Systems and Communications Systems and communications expense includes costs for development and maintenance of trading, regulatory and administrative systems; investments in system capacity, reliability and security; and cost of network connectivity between our customers and data centers, as well as connectivity to various other market centers. Systems and communications expense also includes fees paid to third party providers of networks and information technology resources, including fees for consulting, research and development services, software rental costs and licenses, hardware rental and related fees paid to third party maintenance providers. Professional Services Professional services expense includes consulting charges related to various technological and operational initiatives, including fees paid to LCH.Clearnet in connection with certain clearing guarantee arrangements and FINRA in connection with the transfer of certain member firm regulatory functions, as well as legal and audit fees. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses include (i) occupancy costs; (ii) marketing costs consisting of advertising, printing and promotion expenses; (iii) insurance premiums, travel and entertainment expenses, co branding, investor education and advertising expenses with NYSE listed companies; (iv) general and administrative expenses; and (v) regulatory fine income levied by NYSE Regulation. Regulatory fine income must be used for regulatory purposes. Subsequent to the July 30, 2007 asset purchase agreement with FINRA, the amount of regulatory fine income has been relatively immaterial. 56 Table of Contents Merger Expenses and Exit Costs Merger expenses and exit costs consist of severance costs and related curtailment losses, contract termination costs, depreciation charges triggered by the acceleration of certain fixed asset useful lives, as well as legal and other professional fees and expenses directly attributable to business combinations and cost reduction initiatives. 57 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2011 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2010 The following table sets forth NYSE Euronexts consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each item for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2010.

This compares to total revenues, less transaction based expenses, operating income and net income attributable to NYSE Euronext of $2,511 million, $745 million and $577 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010. 58 Table of Contents The $161 million increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses, $105 million increase in operating income and $42 million increase in net income attributable to NYSE Euronext for the period reflect the following principal factors: Increased total revenues, less transaction based expenses Total revenues, less transaction based expenses increased primarily due to growth in technology services revenue, strong trading volumes in our European cash and U.S. derivatives businesses and positive foreign currency impact of $56 million. Increased operating income The period over period increase in operating income of $105 million was primarily due to an increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses of $56 million primarily related to legal, investment banking and other professional fees and costs incurred in connection with the terminated Proposed Business Combination with Deutsche B&ouml;rse. Excluding the net impact of merger and exit activities, a tax settlement related to BlueNext ($42 million), the impact of foreign currency ($27 million) and new business initiatives ($31 million), our other operating expenses decreased $70 million or 4% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Increased net income attributable to NYSE Euronext As compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, the period over period increase in net income attributable to NYSE Euronext of $42 million was mainly due to increased operating income and slightly lower effective tax rate. Segment Results We operate under three reportable segments: Derivatives, Cash Trading and Listings, and Information Services and Technology Solutions. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on revenue and operating income. For discussion of these segments, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements and Overview above. % of TotalRevenues Segment Revenues (in millions) 2011 2010 2011 2010 Derivatives $ 1,135 $ 1,088 25 % 25 % Cash Trading and Listings 2,929 2,893 64 % 65 % Information Services and Technology Solutions 490 444 11 % 10 % Total segment revenues $ 4,554 $ 4,425 100 % 100 % Derivatives Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2011 2010 Transaction and clearing fees $ 1,046 $ 1,005 4 % 92 % 93 % Market data 48 47 2 % 4 % 4 % Other revenues 41 36 14 % 4 % 3 % Total revenues 1,135 1,088 4 % 100 % 100 % Transaction based expenses: Liquidity payments, routing and clearing 274 262 5 % 24 % 24 % Total revenues, less transaction based expenses 861 826 4 % 76 % 76 % Merger expenses and exit costs 3 15 (80 )% 1 % 2 % Other operating expenses 388 372 4 % 34 % 34 % Operating income $ 470 $ 439 7 % 41 % 40 % 59 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2011, Derivatives operating income increased $31 million to $470 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our U.S. options trading volume of 20%, improved non transaction based revenues, reduced merger expenses and exit costs and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $16 million), partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses. Cash Trading and Listings Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2011 2010 Transaction and clearing fees $ 2,116 $ 2,123 % 72 % 73 % Market data 193 200 (4 )% 7 % 7 % Listing 446 422 6 % 15 % 15 % Other revenues 174 148 18 % 6 % 5 % Total revenues 2,929 2,893 1 % 100 % 100 % Transaction based expenses: Section 31 fees 371 315 18 % 13 % 11 % Liquidity payments, routing and clearing 1,235 1,337 (8 )% 42 % 46 % Total revenues, less transaction based expenses 1,323 1,241 7 % 45 % 43 % Merger expenses and exit costs 19 56 (66 )% 1 % 2 % Other operating expenses 832 809 3 % 28 % 28 % Operating income $ 472 $ 376 26 % 16 % 13 % For the year ended December 31, 2011, Cash Trading and Listings operating income increased $96 million to $472 million. This was primarily due to an increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses reflecting improved listing fees, an increase in our European cash trading volumes, higher average net revenue capture for U.S. cash equity, and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $10 million). Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 included a $42 million charge incurred in connection with BlueNexts settlement of a tax matter with the French tax authorities of which 40% or $17 million was contributed by Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts (see Noncontrolling Interest). Excluding the impact of the BlueNext tax matter, Cash Trading and Listings other operating expenses decreased $19 million as part of our cost containment initiatives. Information Services and Technology Solutions Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2011 2010 Market data $ 130 $ 126 3 % 27 % 28 % Technology services 360 318 13 % 73 % 72 % Total revenues 490 444 10 % 100 % 100 % Merger expenses and exit costs 4 17 (76 )% 1 % 4 % Other operating expenses 364 355 3 % 74 % 80 % Operating income $ 122 $ 72 69 % 25 % 16 % For the year ended December 31, 2011, Information Services and Technology Solutions operating income increased $50 million to $122 million. The increase was primarily due to the growth of our software business and the increase in our global connectivity fees related to the new data centers in Mahwah and Basildon as well as the 60 Table of Contents favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $4 million), partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses in connection with the run of our data centers, as well as new personnel and consultants to support the growth of our Information Services and Technology Solutions revenues. Corporate/Eliminations Year Ended December 31, (in millions) Increase 2011 2010 (Decrease) Other revenues $ (2 ) $ (100 )% Total revenues (2 ) (100 )% Merger expenses and exit costs 88 100 % Other operating expenses 124 142 (13 )% Operating (loss) income $ (214 ) $ (142 ) 51 % Corporate and eliminations include unallocated costs primarily related to corporate governance, public company expenses, duplicate costs associated with migrating our data centers and costs associated with our pension, SERP and postretirement benefit plans as well as intercompany eliminations of revenues and expenses. The increase in merger expenses and exit costs was mainly due to legal, investment banking and other professional fees and costs incurred in connection with the terminated Proposed Business Combination with Deutsche B&ouml;rse. Non Operating Income and Expenses Interest Expense Interest expense is primarily attributable to the interest expense on the debt incurred in connection with $750 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 1,000 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2015. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources). The increase is primarily a result of the fact that we no longer capitalize a portion of our interest expense for the development of our Mahwah and Basildon data centers which became operational in the second half of 2010. Interest and Investment Income The increase in our average cash and investment balances, reduction of interest rates and foreign currency rates were the primary drivers of the $4 million increase in investment income. Loss From Associates For the year ended December 31, 2011, the increase in loss from associates is primarily due to the impact of the investment in NYPC which was in development stage. Other Income For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a $56 million one time gain on the sale of our equity investment in the National Stock Exchange of India. We did not record any material other income or expense items in the 2011 period. Noncontrolling Interest For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, NYSE Euronext recorded noncontrolling interest loss of $16 million and $19 million, respectively. In 2011, noncontrolling interest loss consisted primarily of (i) the portion of the NYSE Liffe U.S. and NYSE Blue losses not owned by NYSE Euronext, (ii) the noncontrolling interest portion of the BlueNext tax settlement corresponding to Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts 40% pro rata share of such charge, partially offset by (iii) the noncontrolling interest income reflecting the profitability attributable to NYSE Amex Options. In June 2011, we completed the sale of a significant equity interest in NYSE Amex Options to seven external investors. 61 Table of Contents Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, NYSE Euronext provided for income taxes at an estimated tax rate of 17% and 19%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronexts overall effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to a discrete deferred tax benefit related to an enacted reduction in the corporate tax rate in the United Kingdom and higher earnings generated from foreign operations, where the applicable foreign jurisdictions tax rate is lower than the statutory rate. 62 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2010 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 For the year ended December 31, 2009, the results of operations of NYSE Euronext included the results of operations of NYFIX since its acquisition date on November 30, 2009. The following table sets forth NYSE Euronexts consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, as well as the percentage increase or decrease for each item for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to such item for the year ended December 31, 2009.

This compares to total revenues, less transaction based expenses, operating income and net income attributable to NYSE Euronext of $2,478 million, $286 million and $219 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $33 million increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses, $459 million increase in operating income and $358 million increase in net income attributable to NYSE Euronext for the period reflect the following principal factors: Increased total revenues, less transaction based expenses Total revenues, less transaction based expenses increased primarily due to increased volumes in our derivatives business and growth in information services and technology solutions offset by decreased volumes in certain U.S. cash trading venues and price changes in our European cash trading venues. See further detailed discussion within each segment analysis. Increased operating income The period over period increase in operating income of $459 million was primarily due to reduced other operating expenses of $426 million mainly associated with a one time NYSE Liffe Clearing payment of $355 million in 2009 and increased total revenues, less transaction based expenses. Excluding net impact of merger and acquisition activity ($54 million), the impact of foreign currency ($19 million), new business initiatives ($35 million) and data center integration costs ($45 million), our other operating expenses decreased $113 million or 7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Increased net income attributable to NYSE Euronext As compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, the period over period increase in net income attributable to NYSE Euronext of $358 million was mainly due to increased operating income and a $56 million one time gain on the sale of our 5% equity interest in the National Stock Exchange of India, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Segment Results We revised our reportable business segments effective in the first quarter of 2010. The new segments are Derivatives, Cash Trading and Listings, and Information Services and Technology Solutions. Historical financial results have been revised to reflect this change. For discussion of these segments, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements and Overview above. % of TotalRevenues Segment Revenues (in millions) 2010 2009 2010 2009 Derivatives $ 1,088 $ 918 25 % 20 % Cash Trading and Listings 2,893 3,397 65 % 73 % Information Services and Technology Solutions 444 363 10 % 7 % Total segment revenues $ 4,425 $ 4,678 100 % 100 % 64 Table of Contents Derivatives Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2010 2009 Transaction and clearing fees $ 1,005 $ 845 19 % 93 % 92 % Market data 47 42 12 % 4 % 5 % Other revenues 36 31 16 % 3 % 3 % Total revenues 1,088 918 19 % 100 % 100 % Transaction based expenses: Liquidity payments, routing and clearing 262 195 34 % 24 % 21 % Total revenues, less transaction based expenses 826 723 14 % 76 % 79 % Merger expenses and exit costs 15 382 (96 )% 2 % 42 % Other operating expenses 372 381 (2 )% 34 % 41 % Operating income (loss) $ 439 $ (40 ) NM 40 % (4 )% NM Not meaningful. For the year ended December 31, 2010, Derivatives operating income increased $479 million to $439 million. The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in total revenues, less transaction based expenses reflecting an increase in our European average daily volume of 14.8% as compared to the same period a year ago, (ii) the inclusion of the full year results of NYSE Liffe Clearing in 2010, (iii) an increase in our U.S. options market share, (iv) reduced merger expenses and exit costs which included a one time NYSE Liffe Clearing payment of $355 million in 2009 and (v) a $9 million decrease of other operating expenses reflecting the results of operating efficiencies, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately $10 million). Cash Trading and Listings Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2010 2009 Transaction and clearing fees $ 2,123 $ 2,582 (18 )% 73 % 76 % Market data 200 221 (10 )% 7 % 7 % Listing 422 407 4 % 15 % 12 % Other revenues 148 187 (21 )% 5 % 5 % Total revenues 2,893 3,397 (15 )% 100 % 100 % Transaction based expenses: Section 31 fees 315 388 (19 )% 11 % 11 % Liquidity payments, routing and clearing 1,337 1,623 (18 )% 46 % 48 % Total revenues, less transaction based expenses 1,241 1,386 (10 )% 43 % 41 % Merger expenses and exit costs 56 104 (46 )% 2 % 3 % Other operating expenses 809 867 (7 )% 28 % 26 % Operating income $ 376 $ 415 (9 )% 13 % 12 % 65 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2010, Cash Trading and Listings operating income decreased $39 million to $376 million. This was primarily due to a $145 million decrease in total revenues, less transaction based expenses. Our U.S. venues average daily volume experienced a 20.9% decline while improving revenue capture. Our European venues had an increase in average daily volume of 6.8% and deteriorated, yet stabilized by year end, revenue capture. The decline in our total revenues, less transaction based expenses was partially offset by reduced levels of merger expenses and exit costs as well as a $58 million decrease of other operating expenses as part of our cost containment initiatives. Information Services and Technology Solutions Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) % ofRevenues 2010 2009 Market data $ 126 $ 140 (10 )% 28 % 39 % Technology services 318 223 43 % 72 % 61 % Total revenues 444 363 22 % 100 % 100 % Merger expenses and exit costs 17 27 (37 )% 4 % 7 % Other operating expenses 355 309 15 % 80 % 85 % Operating income $ 72 $ 27 167 % 16 % 8 % For the year ended December 31, 2010, Information Services and Technology Solutions operating income increased $45 million to $72 million. The increase was primarily due to the growth of our software business and the inclusion of the full year results of NYFIX in 2010, a business acquired on November 30, 2009. Corporate/Eliminations Year Ended December 31, (in millions) Increase 2010 2009 (Decrease) Other revenues $ $ 6 (100 )% Total revenues 6 (100 )% Merger expenses and exit costs 3 (100 )% Other operating expenses 142 119 19 % Operating (loss) income $ (142 ) $ (116 ) 22 % Corporate and eliminations include unallocated costs primarily related to corporate governance, public company expenses, duplicate costs associated with migrating our data centers and costs associated with our pension, SERP and postretirement benefit plans as well as intercompany eliminations of revenues and expenses. The increase in other operating expenses is mainly due to increased data center migration costs. Non Operating Income and Expenses Interest Expense Interest expense is primarily attributable to the interest expense on the debt incurred in connection with $750 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 1,000 million of fixed rate bonds due in June 2015. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources). The reduction in interest expense is primarily driven by lower outstanding debt balances. Interest and Investment Income The decrease in our average cash and investment balances, reduction of interest rates and foreign currency rates were the primary drivers of the $8 million decrease in investment income. 66 Table of Contents Income (Loss) From Associates For the year ended December 31, 2010, the decrease in income (loss) from associates is primarily due to the impact of the investment in NYPC which was in development stage. Other Income For the year ended December 31, 2010, other income increased $27 million to $55 million as compared to the same period a year ago. The increase is primarily due to a $56 million gain on the sale of our equity investment in the National Stock Exchange of India, partially offset by foreign exchange gains and losses and dividends on certain investments, which may vary period over period. Noncontrolling Interest For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, NYSE Euronext recorded noncontrolling interest loss of $19 million and $7 million, respectively. The increase of $12 million in noncontrolling interest loss year over year primarily reflects the reduced profitability of NYSE Blue and the operating losses of NYSE Liffe U.S., which was in development stage. Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, NYSE Euronext provided for income taxes at an estimated tax rate of 19% and benefited from income taxes at an estimated tax rate of 3%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010, NYSE Euronexts overall effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to lower tax rates on its foreign operations, the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and a discrete deferred tax benefit related to an enacted reduction in the corporate tax rate in both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Liquidity and Capital Resources NYSE Euronexts financial policy seeks to finance the growth of its business, remunerate shareholders and ensure financial flexibility, while maintaining strong creditworthiness and liquidity. NYSE Euronexts primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, current assets and existing bank facilities. NYSE Euronexts principal liquidity requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate use. Cash Flows For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,000 million, representing primarily net income of $603 million, depreciation and amortization of $286 million, partially offset by a positive change in working capital of $206 million. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $170 million. Under the terms of the operating agreement of the NYSE, no regulatory fees, fines or penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be distributed to NYSE Euronext or any entity other than NYSE Regulation. As a result, the use of regulatory fees, fines and penalties collected by NYSE Regulation may be considered restricted. As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext did not have significant restricted cash balances. Net Financial Indebtedness As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext had approximately $2.1 billion in debt outstanding and $0.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and financial investments, resulting in $1.7 billion in net indebtedness. We define net indebtedness as outstanding debt less cash, cash equivalents and financial investments. 67 Table of Contents Net indebtedness was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 396 $ 327 Financial investments 36 52 Cash, cash equivalents and financial investments [a] $ 432 $ 379 Short term debt 39 366 Long term debt 2,036 2,074 Total debt [b] $ 2,075 $ 2,440 Net indebtedness [b] [a] $ 1,643 $ 2,061 Cash, cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronexts main debt instruments were as follows (in millions): PrincipalAmount Maturity 4.8% bond in U.S. dollar $750 June 30, 2013 5.375% bond in Euro 1,000($1,296) June 30, 2015 In 2007, NYSE Euronext entered into a U.S. dollar and euro denominated global commercial paper program of $3.0 billion in order to refinance the acquisition of the Euronext shares. As of December 31, 2011, NYSE Euronext had no debt outstanding under this commercial paper program. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (Libor U.S. for commercial paper issued in U.S. dollar and Euribor for commercial paper issued in euro). The fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may therefore impact the interest expense incurred by NYSE Euronext. The commercial paper program is backed by a $1.4 billion syndicated revolving bank facility maturing on July 31, 2012. This bank facility is also available for general corporate purposes and was not drawn as of December 31, 2011. This bank facility was initially entered into in 2007 for an amount of $2.0 billion and was subsequently amended on December 8, 2011. Pursuant to the amendment, the size of the facility decreased to $1,357 million as of December 8, 2011 and will further decrease to $1.2 billion as of April 4, 2012. In August 2006, prior to the combination with NYSE Group, Euronext entered into a 300 million revolving credit facility available for general corporate purposes, which matured on August 4, 2011. The commercial paper program and the credit facilities include terms and conditions customary for agreements of this type, which may restrict NYSE Euronexts ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness In 2008, NYSE Euronext issued $750 million of 4.8% fixed rate bonds due in June 2013 and 750 million of 5.375% fixed rate bonds due in June 2015 in order to, among other things, refinance outstanding commercial paper and lengthen the maturity profile of its debt. In 2009, NYSE Euronext increased the 750 million 5.375% notes due in June 2015 to 1 billion as a result of an incremental offering of 250 million. The terms of the bonds do not contain any financial covenants. The bonds may be redeemed by NYSE Euronext or the bond holders under certain customary circumstances, including a change in control accompanied by a downgrade of the bonds below an investment grade rating. The terms of the bonds also provide for customary events of default and a negative pledge covenant. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all of our debt instruments covenants in all material respects. Liquidity Risk NYSE Euronext continually reviews its liquidity and debt positions, and subject to market conditions and credit and strategic considerations, may from time to time determine to vary the maturity profile of its debt and 68 Table of Contents diversify its sources of financing. NYSE Euronext anticipates being able to support short term liquidity and operating needs primarily through existing cash balances and financing arrangements, along with future cash flows from operations. If existing financing arrangements are insufficient to meet anticipated needs or to refinance existing debt, NYSE Euronext may seek additional financing in either the debt or equity markets. NYSE Euronext may also seek equity or debt financing in connection with future acquisitions or other strategic transactions. While we believe that we generally have access to debt markets, including bank facilities and publicly and privately issued long and short term debt, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. Because new issues of commercial paper generally fund the retirement of outstanding issues, NYSE Euronext is also exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to refinance outstanding commercial paper. In order to mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain backstop bank facilities for an aggregate amount exceeding at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program. In the event that we are unable to issue new commercial paper, we may draw on these backstop facilities. Share Repurchase Program In 2008, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our common stock. Under the program, we may repurchase stock from time to time at the discretion of management in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to applicable United States or European laws, regulations and approvals, strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors. This stock repurchase plan does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of our common stock and any such repurchases will be made in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations, including rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable EU regulations and regulations of the AMF. A summary of common stock purchases is as follows: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Period Total Number ofShares Purchased AveragePrice PaidPer Share Total Number of SharesPurchased as Part ofPublicly AnnouncedPlans or Programs Approximate DollarValue of Shares thatMay Yet BePurchased Under thePlans or Programs $ 1,000 2008 13,363,661 $ 26.04 13,363,661 652 2009/2010 13,363,661 652 2011(1) 3,712,261 26.96 17,075,922 552 17,075,922 (1) All shares were repurchased during the month of November 2011. 69 Table of Contents Summary Disclosures About Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes NYSE Euronexts debt, future minimum lease obligations on its operating leases and other commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): Payments Due by Year(1) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Debt (principal and accrued interest obligations) $ 2,075 $ 39 $ 749 $ $ 1,287 $ $ Debt (future interest obligations) 298 70 88 70 70 Operating lease obligations 345 63 58 51 42 25 106 Other commitments(2) 77 40 37 $ 2,795 $ 212 $ 932 $ 121 $ 1,399 $ 25 $ 106 (1) As of December 31, 2011, obligations under capital leases were not significant. NYSE Euronext also has obligations related to other post retirement benefits, deferred compensation and unrecognized tax positions. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined. See Notes 7 Pension and Other Benefit Programs, 9 Stock Based Compensation, and 15 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, the external investors in our NYSE Amex Options market have received an equity instrument which is tied to their individual contribution to the options exchanges success and have the option to require NYSE Euronext to repurchase a portion of the instruments on an annual basis over the course of five years starting in 2011. The amount NYSE Euronext is required to purchase under this arrangement is capped each year at between 5% and 15% of the total outstanding shares of NYSE Amex Options. NYSE Euronext recognized the full redemption value, i.e. fair value, of this instrument as mezzanine equity and classified the related balance as Redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2011. However, NYSE Euronext cannot predict whether the external investors will elect to exercise their put option. (2) Primarily reflects the outstanding commitment for our investment in the Qatar Exchange. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following provides information about NYSE Euronexts critical accounting policies and estimates. Critical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially produce materially different results, assumptions and conditions. Revenue Recognition There are two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our exchanges listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate actions. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are not applicable to companies when they list on the NYSE or NYSE Arca in the context of a transfer from another market. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares. Annual fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original listing fees are recognized on a straight line basis over their estimated service periods of 10 years for NYSE and Euronext, and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, NYSE Euronext, through NYSE Technologies Trading Solutions business, licenses software and provides software services which are accounted for in accordance with Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic of the Codifications. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets NYSE Euronext reviews the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually based upon estimated fair value of NYSE Euronexts reporting units. Should the review indicate that goodwill is impaired, 70 Table of Contents NYSE Euronexts goodwill would be reduced by the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its fair value. NYSE Euronext reviews the useful life of its indefinite lived intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life categorization. In addition, the carrying value of NYSE Euronexts indefinite lived intangible assets is reviewed by NYSE Euronext at least annually for impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the asset. For purposes of performing the impairment test, fair values are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which, among other factors, is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long term rate of growth for businesses, and determination of weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill and other intangible impairment for each reporting unit. Income Taxes NYSE Euronext records income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and tax bases in assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided for certain tax carryforwards. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. NYSE Euronext is subject to tax regulations in numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions primarily based on its operations in these jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in NYSE Euronexts financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could have material impact on NYSE Euronexts financial position or results of operations. Pension and Other Post Retirement Employee Benefits Pension and Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates to measure future obligation and interest expense, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates and other factors. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect NYSE Euronexts pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense. Hedging Activities NYSE Euronext uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. NYSE Euronext accounts for derivatives pursuant to the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Codification. The Derivatives and Hedging Topic establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires that all derivatives be recorded at fair value on the statement of financial condition. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in other comprehensive income or net income depending on whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in cash flows or changes in fair value. Recently Issued Accounting Guidance The FASB issued ASU 2011 05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, and ASU 2011 12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other 71 Table of Contents Comprehensive Income in ASU 2011 05, which amend certain provisions in Subtopic 220 10 in the Comprehensive Income Topic of the Codification. The amendments in ASU 2011 05 require that the net income and other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income. The ASU 2011 05 also requires reclassification of other comprehensive income components to be presented in the face of the income statement as well as in the face of the statement of comprehensive income. The amendments in ASU 2011 05 do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The amendments also do not change the option for an entity to present components of other comprehensive income either net of related tax effects or before related tax effects, with one amount shown for the aggregate income tax expense or benefit related to the total of other comprehensive income items. In both cases, the tax effect for each component must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements or presented in the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. However, the ASU 2011 12 postponed the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in ASU 2011 05. Both ASU 2011 05 and ASU 2011 12 amendments should be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. NYSE Euronext adopted these provisions in 2011, and they did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued ASU 2011 08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which amends certain provisions in Subtopic 350 20 in the Intangibles Goodwill and Other Topic of the Codification. The amendments in ASU 2011 08 provide changes to the goodwill impairment guidance that are intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual impairment test. The changes allow entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The new qualitative indicators replace those currently used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required. In addition, the indicators will be applicable for assessing whether to perform step two for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. These amendments will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. We do not believe that this will have a significant impact on our financial statements. The FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009 13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, which supersedes certain provisions in Subtopic 25 in the Revenue Recognition Topic of the Codification. ASU 2009 13 requires an entity to allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices. It also eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation which was allowed under previous guidance and requires the use of the relative selling price method in all circumstances in which an entity recognizes revenue for an arrangement with multiple deliverable subject to the Subtopic 25 in the Revenue Recognition Topic. ASU 2009 13 also requires both ongoing disclosures regarding an entitys multiple element revenue arrangements as well as certain transitional disclosures during periods after adoption. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We adopted this as of January 1, 2011, and the adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. The FASB issued ASU 2009 14, Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements, which amends certain provisions in Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic of the Codification. The amendments in ASU 2009 14 change revenue recognition for tangible products containing software elements and non software elements as follows: (1) the tangible element of the product is always outside the scope of Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic; (2) the software elements of tangible products are outside of the scope of Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic when the software elements and non software elements function together to deliver the products essential functionality and (3) undelivered elements in the arrangement related to the non software components also are excluded from the software revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2009 14 applies to transactions which contain both software and non software elements. For these transactions, companies will have to go through a two step process for the software elements. First, a company has to allocate the total consideration to separate units of account for the non software elements and software elements as a group, using relative selling price 72 Table of Contents method. Second, the amount allocated to the software elements as a group will then be accounted for in accordance with the requirements in Subtopic 605 in the Software Topic of the Codification. This may require the use of Residual Method of allocation if VSOE (vendor specific objective evidence) or TPE (third party evidence) does not exist for the undelivered elements. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, and it is also applicable to existing arrangements that are materially modified after the effective date. We adopted this as of January 1, 2011, and the adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK General As a result of its operating and financing activities, NYSE Euronext is exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, currency risk and credit risk. NYSE Euronext has implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. NYSE Euronexts central treasury is charged with identifying risk exposures and monitoring and managing such risks on a daily basis. To the extent permitted by local regulation and necessary, NYSE Euronexts subsidiaries centralize their cash investments, report their risks and hedge their exposures with the central treasury. NYSE Euronext performs sensitivity analyses to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have. NYSE Euronext uses derivative instruments solely to hedge financial risks related to its financial positions or risks that are otherwise incurred in the normal course of its commercial activities. It does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Except for fixed rate bonds, most of NYSE Euronexts financial assets and liabilities are based on floating rates, on fixed rates with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in less than one year or on fixed rates that have been swapped to floating rates via fixed to floating rate swaps. The following table summarizes NYSE Euronexts exposure to interest rate risk as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): FinancialAssets FinancialLiabilities NetExposure Impact(2) of a100 bpsAdverse Shift inInterest Rates(3) Floating rate(1) positions in Dollar $ 162 $ 4 $ 158 $ (1.6 ) Euro 31 35 (4 ) (0.1 ) Sterling 204 204 (2.0 ) Fixed rate positions in Dollar 749 (749 ) (11.3 ) Euro 1,287 (1,287 ) (43.2 ) Sterling (1) Includes floating rate, fixed rate with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in less than one year and fixed rate swapped to floating rate. (2) Impact on profit and loss for floating rate positions (cash flow risk) and on equity until realization in profit and loss for fixed rate positions (price risk). (3) 100 basis points parallel shift of yield curve. 73 Table of Contents NYSE Euronext is exposed to price risk on its outstanding fixed rate positions. As of December 31, 2011, fixed rate positions in U.S. dollar and in euro with an outstanding maturity or reset date falling in more than one year amounted to $749 million and $1,287 million, respectively. A hypothetical shift of 1% in the U.S. dollar or in the euro interest rate curves would in the aggregate impact the fair value of these positions by $11.3 million and $43.2 million, respectively. NYSE Euronext is exposed to cash flow risk on its floating rate positions. Because NYSE Euronext is a net lender in U.S. dollar and sterling, when interest rates in U.S. dollar or sterling decrease, NYSE Euronexts net interest and investment income decreases. Based on December 31, 2011 positions, a hypothetical 1% decrease in U.S. dollar or sterling rates would negatively impact annual income by $1.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. Because NYSE Euronext is a net borrower in euro, when interest rates in euro increase, NYSE Euronext net interest and investment income decreases. Based on December 31, 2011 positions, a hypothetical 1% increase in euro rates would negatively impact annual income by less than $0.1 million. Currency Risk As an international group, NYSE Euronext is subject to currency translation risk.

Credit Risk NYSE Euronext is exposed to credit risk in the event of a counterparty default. NYSE Euronext limits its exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which it makes investments and executes agreements. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. NYSE Euronexts investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. NYSE Euronext seeks to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties. An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, NYSE Euronexts policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk. Derivatives are negotiated with highly rated banks. 75 Table of Contents
