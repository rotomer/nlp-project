ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARISON OF 2001 WITH 2000 For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded earnings of $360.7 million before an extraordinary item compared to a net loss of $269.7 million for 2000. Net earnings of $356.6 million for 2001 reflect $4.1 million of an extraordinary charge from the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding the effects of unusual items for both 2001 and 2000 discussed in the table below, the Companys 2001 earnings of $199.0 million before an extraordinary item decreased $35.1 million, or 15.0%, from 2000 earnings of $234.1 million. The following table lists unusual items (in millions of dollars) recorded in 2001 and 2000, and their related effects on both EBIT and earnings before extraordinary items. EBIT is defined as earnings before interest income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, minority share owners interest in earnings of subsidiaries, and extraordinary charges.

(9.3) Before unusual items........................................ $860.9 $ 234.1 Consolidated EBIT, excluding unusual items, for 2001 was $764.3 million, a decrease of $96.6 million, or 11.2%, compared to 2000 EBIT, excluding unusual items, of $860.9 million. The decrease is attributable to lower EBIT for both the Glass Containers segment and the Plastics 19 Packaging segment. Results of both segments are discussed further below. Interest expense, net of interest income and unusual items, decreased $51.1 million from 2000 due principally to lower interest rates and decreased levels of debt. Exclusive of the adjustment for net income tax liabilities in Italy and other unusual items previously discussed, the Companys effective tax rate for 2001 was 38.1%. This compares with a rate of 36.9% for 2000, excluding the adjustment for net income tax liabilities in Italy and other unusual items. The increase in the 2001 rate compared to 2000 is primarily the result of decreased international and domestic tax benefits and credits. Capsule segment results (millions of dollars) for 2001 and 2000 are as follows (a): NET SALES TO UNAFFILIATED CUSTOMERS 2001 2000 Glass Containers......................................... $3,571.2 $3,695.6 Plastics Packaging....................................... 1,817.5 1,787.6 Other.................................................... 13.8 68.9 Segment and consolidated net sales....................... $5,402.5 $5,552.1 EBIT 2001(B) 2000(C) Glass Containers.......................................... $ 489.9 $401.2 Plastics Packaging........................................ 218.1 238.0 Other.....................................................

(b) EBIT for 2001 includes: (1) a gain of $457.3 million related to the sale of the Companys Harbor Capital Advisors business; (2) a $10.3 million gain from the sale of a minerals business in Australia; (3) a $2.8 million gain from the sale of the Companys label business; (4) charges of $82.1 million related to restructuring and impairment charges at certain of the Companys international glass operations, principally Venezuela and Puerto Rico, as well as certain other domestic and international operations; (5) a charge of $31.0 million related to the loss on the sale of the Companys facilities in India; (6) charges of $30.9 million related to special employee benefit programs; (7) a charge of $8.5 million for certain contingencies; and (8) a charge of $7.9 million related to restructuring manufacturing capacity in the medical devices business. These items increased (decreased) segment EBIT as follows: Glass Containers ($92.6) million; Plastics Packaging ($29.8) million; Other segment ($5.1) million; and Eliminations and other retained items $437.5 million. (c) EBIT for 2000 includes charges totaling $798.3 million for the following: (1) $550.0 million related to adjustment of the reserve for estimated future asbestos related costs; (2) $122.4 million related to the consolidation of manufacturing capacity; (3) a net charge of $52.4 million related to early retirement incentives and special termination benefits for 350 United States salaried employees; (4) $40.0 million related to the impairment of property, plant and equipment at the Companys facilities in India; and (5) $33.5 million related principally to the write off of software and related development costs. These items were recorded in the third quarter of 2000. These items decreased segment EBIT as follows: Glass Containers $186.0 million; Plastics Packaging $11.2 million; Eliminations and other retained items $601.1 million. Consolidated net sales for 2001 decreased $149.6 million, or 2.7%, from the prior year. Net sales of the Glass Containers segment decreased $124.4 million from 2000. In North America, the additional sales from the October 2001 acquisition of the Canadian operations were more than offset by decreased shipments of containers for beer producers and conversions of certain juice and iced tea from glass to plastic containers. The combined U.S. dollar sales of the segments foreign affiliates decreased from the prior year. Increased shipments from the Companys operations throughout most of 20 Europe and South America were more than offset by the effects of a strong U.S. dollar and lower shipments from the Companys operations in the United Kingdom and most of the Asia Pacific region. The effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates reduced U.S. dollar sales of the segments foreign affiliates by approximately $140 million. Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment increased $29.9 million, or 1.7%, over 2000, reflecting increased shipments of plastic containers and closures for food and health care, including prescription products, and the effects of higher resin costs on pass through arrangements with customers, partially offset by lower shipments of plastic containers for juice and other beverages and the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates, principally in Australia. The effects of higher resin costs increased sales by approximately $32 million compared to 2000. Segment EBIT for 2001, excluding the 2001 and 2000 unusual items, decreased $15.3 million to $822.2 million, or 15.2% of net sales, from 2000 segment EBIT of $837.5 million, or 15.1% of net sales. Consolidated operating expense (consisting of selling and administrative, engineering, and research and development expenses), before 2001 unusual items of $30.9 million, as a percentage of net sales was 7.1% in 2001 compared to 6.5% in 2000. The increase in operating expenses is attributed to lower pension income and higher costs of certain employee benefit programs. EBIT of the Glass Containers segment decreased $4.7 million, or 0.8%, to $582.5 million, compared to $587.2 million in 2000. The combined U.S. dollar EBIT of the segments foreign affiliates increased from prior year. Increased shipments from the Companys operations throughout most of Europe and South America were partially offset by the effects of a strong U.S. dollar, higher energy costs worldwide, and lower shipments from the Companys operations in the United Kingdom and most of the Asia Pacific region. In the United States, Glass Container EBIT decreased from 2000 principally due to higher energy costs, which have not been fully recovered through price adjustments. EBIT of the Plastics Packaging segment decreased $1.3 million, or 0.5%, to $247.9 million, compared to $249.2 million in 2000. Increased shipments of plastic containers and closures for food and health care, including prescription products, were more than offset by lower shipments of plastic containers for juice and other beverages and one time costs associated with the relocation of a U.S. manufacturing operation to a new and larger facility to accommodate a growing business base. Eliminations and other retained items, excluding the 2001 and 2000 unusual items, declined $81.3 million from 2000 reflecting lower net financial services income due to the sale of the Companys Harbor Capital Advisors business, higher spending on information systems, and certain employee benefit costs increases. The 2001 results include a net pretax gain of $310.0 million ($170.5 million after tax and minority share owners interest) for the following: (1) a gain of $457.3 million ($284.4 million after tax) related to the sale of the Harbor Capital Advisors business; (2) gains totaling $13.1 million ($12.0 million after tax) related to the sale of the label business and the sale of a minerals business in Australia; (3) charges of $82.1 million ($65.3 million after tax and minority share owners interests) related to restructuring and impairment charges at certain of the Companys international glass operations, principally Venezuela and Puerto Rico, as well as certain other domestic and international operations; (4) a charge of $31.0 million (pretax and after tax) related to the loss on the sale of the Companys facilities in India; (5) charges of $30.9 million ($19.4 million after tax) related to special employee benefit programs; (6) a charge of $8.5 million ($5.3 million after tax) for certain contingencies; and (7) a charge of $7.9 million ($4.9 million after tax) related to restructuring manufacturing capacity in the medical devices business. The 2000 results include pretax charges totaling $798.3 million ($513.1 million after tax and minority share owners interests) for the following: (1) $550.0 million ($342.1 million after tax) related to adjustment of the reserve for estimated future asbestos related costs; (2) $122.4 million ($77.3 million after tax and minority share owners interests) related to the consolidation of manufacturing capacity; (3) a net charge of $52.4 million ($32.6 million after tax) related to early 21 retirement incentives and special termination benefits for 350 United States salaried employees; (4) $40.0 million (pretax and after tax) related to the impairment of property, plant and equipment at the Companys facilities in India; and (5) $33.5 million ($21.1 million after tax and minority share owners interests) related principally to the write off of software and related development costs. COMPARISON OF 2000 WITH 1999 For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recorded a net loss of $269.7 million compared to earnings of $299.1 million before extraordinary items for 1999. Net earnings of $298.3 million for 1999 reflect $0.8 million of extraordinary charges from the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding the effects of unusual items for both 2000 and 1999 discussed in the table below, the Companys 2000 earnings of $234.1 million decreased $55.4 million, or 19.1%, from 1999 earnings of $289.5 million before extraordinary items. The 2000 results include the unusual items discussed above. The 1999 results included the following unusual items: (1) gains totaling $40.8 million ($23.6 million after tax and minority share owners interests) related to the sales of a U.S. glass container plant and a mold manufacturing business in Colombia and (2) charges totaling $20.8 million ($14.0 million after tax and minority share owners interests) related principally to restructuring costs and write offs of certain assets in Europe and South America. Consolidated EBIT, excluding unusual items, for 2000 was $860.9 million, a decrease of $14.3 million, or 1.6%, compared to 1999 EBIT, excluding unusual items, of $875.2 million. The decrease is attributable to lower EBIT for the Plastics Packaging segment, partially offset by slightly higher EBIT for the Glass Containers segment. Results of both segments are discussed further below. Interest expense, net of interest income, increased $56.8 million from the 1999 period due principally to higher interest rates. The $8.8 million increase in minority share owners interests in earnings of subsidiaries resulted from higher net earnings of certain foreign affiliates, principally the affiliates in Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil. Exclusive of the adjustment for net income tax liabilities in Italy and other unusual items previously discussed, the Companys effective tax rate for 2000 was 36.9%. This compares with a rate of 36.9% for 1999, excluding unusual items. Capsule segment results (millions of dollars) for 2000 and 1999 are as follows(a): NET SALES TO UNAFFILIATED CUSTOMERS 2000 1999 Glass Containers......................................... $3,695.6 $3,762.6 Plastics Packaging....................................... 1,787.6 1,686.7 Other.................................................... 68.9 73.6 Segment and consolidated net sales....................... $5,552.1 $5,522.9 EBIT 2000(B) 1999 Glass Containers......................................... $ 401.2 $ 602.4(c) Plastics Packaging....................................... 238.0 277.7 Other.................................................... 1.1 9.2 Segment EBIT............................................. 640.3 889.3 Eliminations and other retained items.................. (577.7) 5.9 Consolidated EBIT........................................ $ 62.6 $ 895.2 (a) See Segment Information included on pages 63 66. (b) EBIT for 2000 includes charges totaling $798.3 million for the following: (1) $550.0 million related to adjustment of the reserve for estimated future asbestos related costs; (2) $122.4 million related 22 to the consolidation of manufacturing capacity; (3) a net charge of $52.4 million related to early retirement incentives and special termination benefits for 350 United States salaried employees; (4) $40.0 million related to the impairment of property, plant and equipment at the Companys facilities in India; and (5) $33.5 million related principally to the write off of software and related development costs. These items were recorded in the third quarter of 2000. These items decreased segment EBIT as follows: Glass Containers $186.0 million; Plastics Packaging $11.2 million; Eliminations and other retained items $601.1 million. (c) EBIT for 1999 includes: (1) gains totaling $40.8 million related to the sales of a U.S. glass container plant and a mold manufacturing business in Colombia and (2) charges totaling $20.8 million related principally to restructuring costs and write offs of certain assets in Europe and South America. Consolidated net sales for 2000 increased $29.2 million, or .5%, over the prior year. Net sales of the Glass Containers segment decreased $67.0 million from 1999. In the United States, the effect of increased shipments of containers for beer producers was partially offset by lower shipments of certain food containers. The combined U.S. dollar sales of the segments foreign affiliates decreased from the prior year due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Increased shipments from the Companys operations throughout most of Europe, South America, and the Asia Pacific region were more than offset by lower shipments from the Companys operations in the United Kingdom and the effects of a strong U.S. dollar. The effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates reduced U.S. dollar sales of the segments foreign affiliates by approximately $250 million. Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment increased $100.9 million, or 6.0%, over 1999, reflecting increased shipments of plastic containers for juices, closures for food and beverages, and the effects of higher resin costs on pass through arrangements with customers, partially offset by lower shipments of household, health care, and personal care containers. The effects of higher resin costs increased sales by approximately $90 million compared to 1999. Segment EBIT for 2000, excluding the 2000 and 1999 unusual items, decreased $31.8 million to $837.5 million, or 15.1% of net sales, from 1999 segment EBIT of $869.3 million, or 15.7% of net sales. Consolidated operating expense as a percentage of net sales was 6.5% in 2000 compared to 6.8% in 1999. EBIT of the Glass Containers segment increased $4.8 million, or .8%, to $587.2 million, compared to $582.4 million in 1999. The combined U.S. dollar EBIT of the segments foreign affiliates increased from prior year. Increased shipments from the Companys operations throughout most of Europe, South America, and the Asia Pacific region, and a gain from the restructuring of the ownership in two small joint ventures in South America were partially offset by the effects of a strong U.S. dollar, higher energy costs worldwide, and expenses associated with the scheduled rebuild of a glass melting furnace in Australia. In the United States, Glass Container EBIT decreased from 1999 principally due to higher energy costs and conversions of juice and iced tea bottles from glass to plastic containers, partially offset by further improvements in cost structure. EBIT of the Plastics Packaging segment decreased $28.5 million, or 10.3%, to $249.2 million, compared to $277.7 million in 1999. Increased shipments of plastic containers for juices and closures for food and beverages were more than offset by lower shipments of household, health care, and personal care containers and costs incurred in connection with the start up of new custom PET capacity, including a new plastic bottle plant. Eliminations and other retained items improved $17.5 million from 1999 principally due to higher net financial services income. RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES The 2001 operating results include pretax charges of $90.0 million related to the following: (1) charges of $82.1 million principally related to a restructuring program and impairment at certain of the Companys international and domestic operations. The charge includes the impairment of assets at 23 the Companys affiliate in Puerto Rico and the consolidation of manufacturing capacity and the closing of a facility in Venezuela. The program also includes consolidation of capacity at certain other international and domestic facilities in response to decisions about pricing and market strategy and (2) a charge of $7.9 million related to restructuring manufacturing capacity in the medical devices business. The Company expects its actions related to these restructuring and impairment charges to be completed during the next several quarters. The 2000 operating results include a pretax charge of $248.3 million, principally related to a restructuring and capacity realignment program. The restructuring and capacity realignment program, initiated in the third quarter of 2000, includes the consolidation of manufacturing capacity and a reduction of 350 employees in the U.S. salaried work force, or about 10%, principally as a result of early retirement incentives. Also included in the charge are a write down of plant and equipment for the Companys glass container affiliate in India and certain other asset write offs, including $27.9 million for software which has been abandoned. Manufacturing capacity consolidations principally involve U.S. glass container facilities and reflect technology driven improvements in productivity, conversions of some juice and similar products to plastic containers, Company and customer decisions regarding pricing and volume, and the further concentration of production in the most strategically located facilities. ASBESTOS RELATED CHARGE The asbestos related pretax charge of $550.0 million in 2000 was established to cover estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from outstanding asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims and asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims filed in the ensuing several years, during which period the Company expected to receive the majority of the future asbestos related lawsuits and claims that could involve the Company. The estimate was based on a comprehensive review of the Companys asbestos related assets and liabilities completed during the third quarter of 2000. The Company believes that its ultimate asbestos related contingent liability (i.e., its indemnity or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees) cannot be estimated with certainty. The Companys ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the United States, the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation and found liable for substantial damage awards, the continued use of litigation screenings to generate new lawsuits, the large number of claims asserted or filed by parties who claim prior exposure to asbestos materials but have no present physical impairment as a result of such exposure, and the growing number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy. The Company has continued to monitor trends which may affect its ultimate liability and has continued to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the Company. The Company expects that the gross amount of total asbestos related payments will be moderately lower in 2002 compared to 2001 and will continue to decline thereafter as the number of potential claimants continues to decrease. However, the trend toward lower aggregate annual payments has not occurred as soon as had been anticipated when the additional liability was established in 2000. In addition, the number of claims and lawsuits filed against the Company has exceeded the number anticipated at that time. As a result, the Company is continuing to evaluate trends to determine whether further adjustment of the asbestos related liabilities is appropriate. While the results of this review cannot be estimated at this time, the Company expects that an increase of the liability will be required in order to cover estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims filed in the next several years. 24 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY The Companys total debt at December 31, 2001 was $5.40 billion, compared to $5.85 billion at December 31, 2000. During April 2001, certain of the Companys subsidiaries entered into the Secured Credit Agreement (the "Agreement") with a group of banks, which expires on March 31, 2004. The Agreement provides for a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $1.5 billion term loan. Borrowings under the Agreement were used to repay all amounts outstanding under, and terminate, the Companys Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2001, the Company had available credit totaling $4.045 billion under the Agreement, of which $491.4 million had not been utilized. At December 31, 2000, the Company had $597.8 million of credit which had not been utilized under the Companys Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Cash provided by operating activities was $538.1 million for 2001 compared to $364.8 million for 2000. The increase was principally due to higher asbestos related insurance proceeds. In June 2001, the Company completed the sale of its Harbor Capital Advisors business to Robeco Groep N.V. Harbor Capital Advisors is the adviser to the Harbor Fund family of mutual funds and the pension funds of several companies, including the Companys plans. The Company used substantially all the net cash proceeds from the sale to reduce the outstanding term loan under the Agreement by $455 million. On October 1, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of the Canadian glass container assets of Consumers Packaging Inc. for a purchase price of approximately $150 million and the assumption of certain liabilities. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice approved the transaction as part of a restructuring plan by Consumers Packaging. The purchase price was financed by borrowings under the Agreement. The Agreement contains covenants and provisions that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets, incur additional indebtedness, prepay other indebtedness or amend certain debt instruments, pay dividends, create liens on assets, enter into contingent obligations, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, make investments, loans or advances, make acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations, change the business conducted, or engage in certain transactions with affiliates and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities. In addition, the Agreement contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain, based upon financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, specified financial ratios and tests, including minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, maximum leverage ratios, minimum net worth and specified capital expenditure tests. The Company anticipates that cash flow from its operations and from utilization of credit available through March 2004 under the Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs, debt service and other obligations. The Company expects that its total asbestos related payments in 2002 will be moderately lower than 2001. Based on the Companys expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and its expectation of the collection of its insurance coverage for partial reimbursement for such lawsuits and claims, and also based on the Companys expected operating cash flow, the Company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Companys liquidity on a short term or long term basis. During January 2002, a subsidiary of the Company completed a $1.0 billion private placement of senior secured notes. The notes bear interest at 8 7/8% and are due February 15, 2009. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries. The assets of substantially all of 25 the Companys domestic subsidiaries are pledged as security for the notes. The issuing subsidiary used the net cash proceeds from the notes to reduce the outstanding term loan under the Agreement by $980 million. As such, the Company wrote off unamortized deferred financing fees in January 2002 related to the term loan and recorded an extraordinary charge totaling $10.9 million less applicable income taxes of $4.2 million. The indenture for the notes restricts among other things, the ability of the Companys subsidiaries to borrow money, pay dividends on, or redeem or repurchase stock, make investments, create liens, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. The following information summarizes the Companys significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2001 (millions of dollars). PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN TOTAL ONE YEAR 1 3 YEARS 4+ YEARS Contractual cash obligations: Long term debt...................................... $5,358.3 $30.8 $2,848.6 $2,478.9 Capital lease obligations........................... 2.2 2.2 Operating leases.................................... 243.1 62.0 120.1 61.0 Total contractual cash obligations................ $5,603.6 $92.8 $2,970.9 $2,539.9 AMOUNT OF COMMITMENT EXPIRATION PER PERIOD LESS THAN TOTAL ONE YEAR 1 3 YEARS 4+ YEARS Other commercial commitments: Lines of credit..................................... $2,410.4 $2,410.4 Standby letters of credit........................... 98.2 $98.2 Guarantees.......................................... 35.3 $ 35.3 Total commercial commitments...................... $2,543.9 $98.2 $2,410.4 $ 35.3 The Companys Board of Directors has authorized the management of the Company to repurchase up to 20 million shares of the Companys common stock. During the first quarter of 2001, the Company redeemed the remaining outstanding shares of exchangeable preferred stock. The redeemed exchangeable preferred shares were equivalent to 910,697 shares of the Companys common stock. The Company repurchased these shares pursuant to its share repurchase plan for $5.2 million. During the third quarter of 2001, the Company repurchased 3,500 shares. Since July 1999, the Company has repurchased 12,932,897 shares for $248.0 million. The Company may purchase its common stock from time to time on the open market depending on market conditions and other factors. During the term of the Agreement, the Companys total share repurchases are limited to the lesser of two million shares or $25 million. The Company believes that cash flows from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the Agreement will be sufficient to fund any such repurchases in addition to the obligations to its seasonal working capital needs, debt service, asbestos related payments, and other obligations. EXCESS OF PURCHASE COST OVER NET ASSETS ACQUIRED The excess of purchase cost over net assets acquired, net of accumulated amortization ("goodwill") was $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This represents 30% and 30% of total assets, and 139% and 165% of share owners equity at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the fair values assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired, and, under 26 accounting standards in effect through 2001, was amortized over 40 years. In assigning a benefit period to goodwill, the Company considered regulatory provisions, the technological environment in which the acquired company operates, including barriers to new competing entities, the maturity of the products manufactured by the businesses acquired, and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. The Company had determined that no events or circumstances occurred in 2001 to warrant revised estimates of the goodwill benefit period. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" which is effective for business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. Also in July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("FAS No. 142"), which is effective for goodwill acquired after June 30, 2001. For goodwill acquired prior to June 30, 2001, FAS No. 142 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Under FAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. The Company estimates that adopting FAS No. 142 will increase 2002 earnings before the effects of the accounting change by approximately $90 million compared to 2001 results. The Company has not completed its assessment of the effects that adopting FAS No. 142 will have on the reported value of goodwill, however, the Company expects that it will record an impairment charge in 2002 in connection with adopting FAS No. 142. PENSION BENEFIT PLANS FUNDED STATUS Because of their funded status, the Companys principal pension benefit plans contributed pretax credits to earnings of $97.0 in 2001, $105.4 million in 2000, and $74.4 million in 1999. The Company expects that the amount of such credits for 2002 will be approximately 20% lower than in 2001. The 2001 decrease in pretax pension credits is attributed to lower expected return on assets and the addition of certain pension plans from the acquisition of the Canadian glass container assets of Consumers Packaging Inc. A one half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding the expected return on assets would result in a change of approximately $15 million in pretax pension credits. The funded status of the plans provides assurance of benefits for participating employees, but future effects on operating results depend on economic conditions and investment performance. ITEM 7.(A). QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates, and changes in commodity prices, principally natural gas. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating natural gas prices. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK A substantial portion of the Companys operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities conducted by affiliates in foreign jurisdictions. The primary foreign markets served by the Companys affiliates are in Australia, South America (principally Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela), and Europe (principally Italy, the United Kingdom, and Poland). In general, revenues earned and costs incurred by the Companys major foreign affiliates are denominated in their respective local currencies. Consequently, the Companys reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the Companys affiliates operate. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the reported dollar value of local currency EBIT generally decreases; when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the reported U.S. dollar value of local currency EBIT generally increases. 27 Subject to other business and tax considerations, the Companys strategy is to mitigate the economic effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations on that portion of foreign currency EBIT which is expected to be invested elsewhere or remitted to the parent company. The Companys foreign affiliates generally invest their excess funds in U.S. dollars or dollar based instruments, where such instruments are available with acceptable interest rates and terms. In those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency, however, this strategy exposes the Company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. The Company believes that the benefit of investing excess cash in U.S. dollars or their equivalent outweighs the risk of reporting losses or gains from currency exchange rate fluctuations. In those countries with hyper inflationary economies, where the U.S. dollar is the designated functional currency, this investment strategy for excess funds mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains. Because most of the Companys foreign affiliates operate within their local economic environment, the Company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with local currency borrowings to the extent practicable. Considerations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans, tax implications, and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms. In those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency, this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. In those countries where the U.S. dollar is the designated functional currency, however, local currency borrowings expose the Company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. The Companys Secured Credit Agreement provides for U.S. dollar borrowings by certain foreign affiliates. As of December 31, 2001, amounts outstanding under the Secured Credit Agreement borrowed by foreign affiliates were: MILLIONS OF AFFILIATE LOCATION U.S. DOLLARS Australia................................................... $814.0 United Kingdom.............................................. 130.0 $944.0 A significant portion of the above borrowings has been swapped into local currencies using currency swaps. The Company accounts for these swaps as fair value hedges. As such, the changes in the value of the swaps are included in other expense and are expected to substantially offset any exchange rate gains or losses on the related U.S. dollar borrowings. The remaining portion of the Companys consolidated debt which was denominated in foreign currencies was not significant. The Company believes it does not have material foreign currency exchange rate risk related to the financial instruments (i.e. cash, short term investments, and long term debt) of its foreign affiliates. INTEREST RATE RISK The Companys interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates applicable to its U.S. dollar indebtedness. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in variable interest rates, the Company could, at its option, convert to fixed interest rates by either refinancing variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or entering into interest rate swaps. 28 The following table provides information about the Companys significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2001 OUTSTANDING FAIR VALUE (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS) Variable rate debt: Secured Credit Agreement, matures March 2004: Revolving Loans, interest at a Eurodollar based rate plus 2.00%............................................ $2,410.4 $2,410.4 Term Loan, interest at a Eurodollar based rate plus 2.50%................................................. $1,045.0 $1,045.0 Fixed rate debt: Senior Notes: 7.85%, due 2004......................................... $ 300.0 $ 287.1 7.15%, due 2005......................................... $ 350.0 $ 324.5 8.10%, due 2007......................................... $ 300.0 $ 275.6 7.35%, due 2008......................................... $ 250.0 $ 221.0 Senior Debentures: 7.50%, due 2010......................................... $ 250.0 $ 226.2 7.80%, due 2018......................................... $ 250.0 $ 210.7 COMMODITY RISK The Company is exposed to fluctuations of various commodity prices, most significantly the changes in prices related to natural gas. The Company purchases a significant amount of natural gas at nationally quoted market prices. The Company uses commodity futures contracts related to a portion of its forecasted natural gas requirements. The objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid and the potential volatility in earnings or cash flows from future market price movements. During 2001, the Company entered into commodity futures contracts for approximately 75% of its domestic natural gas usage (approximately 1.2 billion BTUs) through March 2002. The Company has also entered into additional contracts in 2002 with respect to a portion of its forecasted domestic natural gas usage through the end of 2002.

Forward looking statements reflect the Companys best assessment at the time, and thus involve uncertainty and risk. It is possible the Companys future financial performance may differ from expectations due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to the following: (1) foreign currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar, (2) change in capital availability or cost, including interest rate fluctuations, (3) the general political, economic and competitive conditions in markets and countries where the Company has operations, including competitive pricing pressures, inflation or deflation, and changes in tax rates, (4) consumer preferences for alternative forms of packaging, (5) fluctuations in raw material and labor costs, (6) availability of raw materials, (7) costs and availability of energy, (8) transportation costs, (9) consolidation among competitors and customers, (10) the ability of the Company to integrate operations of acquired businesses, (11) the performance by customers of their obligations under purchase agreements, and (12) the timing and occurrence of events which are beyond the control of the Company. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. Any forward looking statements in this document are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Forward looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from expectations. While the Company continually reviews trends and uncertainties affecting the Companys results of operations and financial condition, the Company does not intend to update any particular forward looking statements contained in this document. 29
