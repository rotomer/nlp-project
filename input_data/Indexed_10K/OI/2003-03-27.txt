ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations Comparison of 2002 with 2001 For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded earnings before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting change of $9.4 million compared to earnings before extraordinary items of $360.7 million for 2001. The net loss for 2002 of $460.2 million reflected $9.6 million of extraordinary charges from the early extinguishment of debt and $460.0 million from the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for goodwill. Net earnings of $356.6 million for 2001 reflected $4.1 million from an extraordinary charge from the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding the effects of the 2002 extraordinary items, cumulative effect of accounting change, and the unusual charge of $475.0 million for estimated future asbestos related costs, the Companys 2002 net earnings of $318.2 million increased $26.9 million, or 9.2% from 2001 earnings, excluding extraordinary and unusual items and goodwill amortization (as discussed in the table below), of $291.3 million. The following tables lists unusual items (in millions of dollars) recorded in 2002 and 2001 and goodwill amortization for 2001, and their related effects on both EBIT and earnings before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting change. EBIT is defined as earnings before interest income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, minority share owners interest in earnings of subsidiaries, extraordinary charges and cumulative effect of accounting change. EBIT Earnings before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting change Year ended December 31, 2002 as reported $ 414.2 $ 9.4 Adjustment of the reserve for future asbestos related costs 475.0 308.8 Before unusual item $ 889.2 $ 318.2 EBIT Earnings before extraordinary item Year ended December 31, 2001 as reported $ 1,074.3 $ 360.7 Unusual items charges (credits): Gain on the sale of the Harbor Capital Advisors business (457.3 ) (284.4 ) Gain on the sale of the Companys label business and the sale of a minerals business in Australia (13.1 ) (12.0 ) Restructuring and impairment charges at certain international and domestic operations 82.1 65.3 Loss on the sale of the Companys facilities in India 31.0 31.0 Special employee benefit programs 30.9 19.4 Charges related to certain contingencies 8.5 5.3 Restructuring manufacturing capacity in the medical devices business 7.9 4.9 Charges to adjust net income tax liabilities in Italy 6.0 Net interest on the resolution of the transfer of pension assets and liabilities for a previous acquisition 2.8 Goodwill amortization 92.3 92.3 Before unusual items and goodwill amortization $ 856.6 $ 291.3 21 Consolidated EBIT for 2002, excluding the asbestos related charge, was $889.2 million, an increase of $32.6 million, or 3.8%, compared to 2001 EBIT, excluding unusual items and goodwill amortization, of $856.6 million. The increase was principally due to higher EBIT for the Glass Containers segment, partially offset by lower EBIT for the Plastics Packaging segment and lower EBIT from eliminations and other retained items, as further discussed below. Interest expense, net of interest income and the 2001 unusual expense of $4.0 million, decreased $5.5 million from 2001. The effects of lower short term variable interest rates were partially offset by the first quarter 2002 issuance of $1.0 billion principal amount of 87/8% Senior Secured Notes due 2009 and the fourth quarter 2002 issuance of 83/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2012 totaling $625 million. Proceeds from the Senior Secured Notes were used to repay lower cost, variable rate debt borrowed under the Secured Credit Agreement. Excluding the effect of the asbestos related charge, the Companys effective tax rate for 2002 was 30.1%. This compares with a rate of 30.3% for 2001, adjusted to exclude the effects of unusual items and goodwill amortization. Capsule segment results (in millions of dollars) for 2002 and 2001 were as follows (a) (certain amounts from the prior year have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation): Net sales to unaffiliated customers 2002 2001 Glass Containers $ 3,875.2 $ 3,572.3 Plastics Packaging 1,765.2 1,825.7 Other 4.5 Segment and consolidated net sales $ 5,640.4 $ 5,402.5 EBIT 2002 2001 (c)(d) Glass Containers $ 709.0 $ 534.5 Plastics Packaging 258.2 249.5 Other 3.0 Segment EBIT 967.2 787.0 Eliminations and other retained items (553.0) (b) 379.6 Consolidated EBIT before goodwill amortization 414.2 1,166.6 Amortization of goodwill (92.3 ) Consolidated totals $ 414.2 $ 1,074.3 (a)See Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (b)Eliminations and other retained items for 2002 included a charge of $475.0 million related to adjustment of the reserve for estimated future asbestos related costs. (c)EBIT for 2001 included: (1) a gain of $457.3 million related to the sale of the Companys Harbor Capital Advisors business; (2) a $10.3 million gain from the sale of a minerals business in Australia; (3) a $2.8 million gain from the sale of the Companys label business; (4) charges of $82.1 million related to restructuring and impairment charges at certain of the Companys international glass operations, principally Venezuela and Puerto Rico, as well as certain other domestic and international operations; (5) a charge of $31.0 million related to the loss on the sale of the Companys facilities in India; (6) charges of $30.9 million related to special employee benefit programs; (7) a charge of $8.5 million for certain contingencies; and (8) a charge of $7.9 million related to restructuring manufacturing capacity in the medical devices business. 22 Such charges (gains) are included as follows in consolidated EBIT for 2001 (in millions of dollars): Glass Containers $ 92.6 Plastics Packaging 37.7 Other (2.8 ) Total Product Segments 127.5 Eliminations and other retained items (437.5 ) Consolidated Totals $ (310.0 ) (d)In accordance with FAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized beginning in 2002. In order to facilitate comparisons, goodwill amortization for 2001 has been reclassified out of the Glass Containers and Plastics Packaging segments and reported separately. Consolidated net sales for 2002 increased $237.9 million, or 4.4%, over the prior year. Net sales of the Glass Containers segment increased $302.9 million, or 8.5%, over 2001. In North America, the additional sales from the October 2001 acquisition of the Canadian glass container operations and increased shipments of containers for liquor and wine were partially offset by decreased shipments of containers for food, teas and juices. The combined U.S. dollar sales of the segments other foreign affiliates increased 2.6% over the prior year. Increased shipments throughout most of the Asia Pacific region and portions of Europe were partially offset by the absence of the glass container operations in India (sold in 2001) and the effects of political and economic uncertainty in Venezuela. A national strike in Venezuela that began in early December 2002 caused energy supply curtailments that forced the Company to idle its two plants in the country, adversely affecting net sales by approximately $20 million. The effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar sales of the segments foreign affiliates in Europe and the Asia Pacific region by approximately $90 million and decreased U.S. dollar sales of the segments foreign affiliates in South America by approximately $60 million. Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment decreased $60.5 million, or 3.3%, from 2001. Increased shipments of plastic containers for food, bottled water, juice and health care and closures for food, juice and other beverages were more than offset by lower unit pricing in some product lines, the absence of sales from several small businesses divested during 2002 and the effects of lower resin costs on pass through arrangements with customers. The effects of lower resin cost pass throughs decreased sales approximately $14 million compared to 2001. Segment EBIT for 2002, excluding the effects of the 2002 and 2001 unusual items, increased $52.7 million, or 5.8%, to $967.2 million from the 2001 adjusted EBIT of $914.5 million, adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization. Consolidated operating expenses, excluding unusual items of $30.9 million for 2001, (consisting of selling and administrative, engineering, and research and development expenses) as a percentage of net sales were 7.1% in 2002 compared to 7.1% in 2001. EBIT of the Glass Containers segment increased $81.9 million to $709.0 million, compared to adjusted EBIT of $627.1 million in 2001. The combined U.S. dollar EBIT of the segments foreign affiliates increased 7.7% over prior year. Increased shipments throughout most of the Asia Pacific region and portions of Europe and moderately improved pricing in Europe were partially offset by lower shipments in Brazil and Colombia, the national strike in Venezuela as discussed above and unfavorable currency translation rates throughout most of South America. In North America, Glass Container EBIT increased 9.7% over 2001 principally as a result of the Canadian glass container operations acquired early in the fourth quarter of 2001, moderately improved pricing and product mix, increased shipments of containers for liquor and wine and the recognition of the remaining deferred income associated with the early termination of an energy supply agreement, partially offset by the conversion of certain food and beverage containers to plastic packaging. EBIT of the Plastics Packaging segment decreased $29.0 million, or 10.1%, to $258.2 million compared to adjusted EBIT of $287.2 million in 2001. Increased shipments of plastic containers for food, bottled water, juice and health care and closures for food, juice and other beverages as well as improved manufacturing performance were more than offset 23 by lower unit pricing in some product lines, a $4.1 million unfavorable accounting adjustment at one of the segments foreign affiliates largely due to the write down of inventories to net realizable value, and discontinued production for a major customer in the advanced technology systems business as the customer moves production from the U.S. to the Far East. The Company is commissioning a new factory in the Far East to continue to supply this customer and expects this new factory to be fully operational early in 2003. The Plastics Packaging segment operates in a number of highly competitive markets and has incurred significant pricing pressure during 2002 in some product lines which the Company expects to partially offset by increased unit volume, improved productivity and reduced costs. EBIT from eliminations and other retained items, excluding the 2002 and 2001 unusual items, decreased $20.1 million from 2001 reflecting lower net financial services income due to the sale of the Companys Harbor Capital Advisors business in the second quarter of 2001 as well as higher information systems spending during the year. Results for 2002 included a pretax charge of $475.0 million ($308.8 million after tax) related to the adjustment of the reserve for estimated future asbestos related costs. The 2001 results included a net pretax gain of $310.0 million ($170.5 million after tax and minority share owners interest) for the following: (1) a gain of $457.3 million ($284.4 million after tax) related to the sale of the Harbor Capital Advisors business; (2) gains totaling $13.1 million ($12.0 million after tax) related to the sale of the label business and the sale of a minerals business in Australia; (3) charges of $82.1 million ($65.3 million after tax and minority share owners interests) related to restructuring and impairment charges at certain of the Companys international glass operations, principally Venezuela and Puerto Rico, as well as certain other domestic and international operations; (4) a charge of $31.0 million (pretax and after tax) related to the loss on the sale of the Companys facilities in India; (5) charges of $30.9 million ($19.4 million after tax) related to special employee benefit programs; (6) a charge of $8.5 million ($5.3 million after tax) for certain contingencies; and (7) a charge of $7.9 million ($4.9 million after tax) related to restructuring manufacturing capacity in the medical devices business. Comparison of 2001 with 2000 For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded earnings of $360.7 million before an extraordinary item, compared to a net loss of $269.7 million for 2000. Net earnings of $356.6 million for 2001 reflect $4.1 million of an extraordinary charge from the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding the effects of unusual items for both 2001 and 2000 discussed below, the Companys 2001 earnings of $199.0 million before extraordinary items decreased $35.1 million, or 15.0%, from 2000 earnings of $234.1 million. The 2001 results included the unusual items discussed above. The 2000 results included pretax charges totaling $798.3 million ($513.1 million after tax and minority share owners interests) for the following: (1) $550.0 million ($342.1 million after tax) related to adjustment of the reserve for estimated future asbestos related costs; (2) $122.4 million ($77.3 million after tax and minority share owners interests) related to the consolidation of manufacturing capacity; (3) a net charge of $52.4 million ($32.6 million after tax) related to early retirement incentives and special termination benefits for 350 United States salaried employees; (4) $40.0 million (pretax and after tax) related to the impairment of property, plant and equipment at the Companys facilities in India; and (5) $33.5 million ($21.1 million after tax and minority share owners interests) related principally to the write off of software and related development costs. Consolidated EBIT, excluding unusual items, for 2001 was $764.3 million, a decrease of $96.6 million, or 11.2%, compared to 2000 EBIT, excluding unusual items, of $860.9 million. The decrease was attributable to lower EBIT for both the Glass Containers segment and the Plastics Packaging segment. Results of both segments are discussed further below. Interest expense, net of 24 interest income and unusual items, decreased $51.1 million from 2000 due principally to lower interest rates and decreased levels of debt. Exclusive of the adjustment for net income tax liabilities in Italy and other unusual items previously discussed, the Companys effective tax rate for 2001 was 38.1%. This compares with a rate of 36.9% for 2000, excluding the adjustment for net income tax liabilities in Italy and other unusual items. The increase in the 2001 rate compared to 2000 was primarily the result of decreased international and domestic tax benefits and credits. Capsule segment results (millions of dollars) for 2001 and 2000 were as follows (a): Net sales to unaffiliated customers 2001 2000 Glass Containers $ 3,571.2 $ 3,695.6 Plastics Packaging 1,817.5 1,787.6 Other 13.8 68.9 Segment and consolidated net sales $ 5,402.5 $ 5,552.1 EBIT 2001 (b) 2000 (c) Glass Containers $ 489.9 $ 401.2 Plastics Packaging 218.1 238.0 Other (13.3 ) 1.1 Segment EBIT 694.7 640.3 Eliminations and other retained items 379.6 (577.7 ) Consolidated EBIT $ 1,074.3 $ 62.6 (a)See Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (b)EBIT for 2001 included the unusual items as discussed in note (c) to the table of capsule segment results for 2002 and 2001. (c)EBIT for 2000 included charges totaling $798.3 million for the following: (1) $550.0 million related to adjustment of the reserve for estimated future asbestos related costs; (2) $122.4 million related to the consolidation of manufacturing capacity; (3) a net charge of $52.4 million related to early retirement incentives and special termination benefits for 350 United States salaried employees; (4) $40.0 million related to the impairment of property, plant and equipment at the Companys facilities in India; and (5) $33.5 million related principally to the write off of software and related development costs. These items were recorded in the third quarter of 2000. These items decreased segment EBIT as follows: Glass Containers $186.0 million; Plastics Packaging $11.2 million; Eliminations and other retained items $601.1 million. Consolidated net sales for 2001 decreased $149.6 million, or 2.7%, from the prior year. Net sales of the Glass Containers segment decreased $124.4 million from 2000. In North America, the additional sales from the October 2001 acquisition of the Canadian operations were more than offset by decreased shipments of containers for beer producers and conversions of certain juice and iced tea from glass to plastic containers. The combined U.S. dollar sales of the segments foreign affiliates decreased from the prior year. Increased shipments from the Companys operations throughout most of Europe and South America were more than offset by the effects of a strong U.S. dollar and lower shipments from the Companys operations in the United Kingdom and most of the Asia Pacific region. The effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates reduced U.S. dollar sales of the segments foreign affiliates by approximately $140 million. Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment increased $29.9 million, or 1.7%, over 2000, reflecting increased shipments of plastic containers and closures for food and health care, including prescription products, and the effects of higher resin costs on pass through arrangements with customers, partially offset by lower shipments of plastic containers for 25 juice and other beverages and the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates, principally in Australia. The effects of higher resin costs increased sales by approximately $32 million compared to 2000. Segment EBIT for 2001, excluding the 2001 and 2000 unusual items, decreased $15.3 million to $822.2 million, or 15.2% of net sales, from 2000 segment EBIT of $837.5 million, or 15.1% of net sales. Consolidated operating expenses, before 2001 unusual items of $30.9 million, as a percentage of net sales were 7.1% in 2001 compared to 6.5% in 2000. The increase in operating expenses was attributed to lower pension income and higher costs of certain employee benefit programs. EBIT of the Glass Containers segment decreased $4.7 million, or 0.8%, to $582.5 million, compared to $587.2 million in 2000. The combined U.S. dollar EBIT of the segments foreign affiliates increased from prior year. Increased shipments from the Companys operations throughout most of Europe and South America were partially offset by the effects of a strong U.S. dollar, higher energy costs worldwide, and lower shipments from the Companys operations in the United Kingdom and most of the Asia Pacific region. In the United States, Glass Container EBIT decreased from 2000 principally due to higher energy costs, which were not fully recovered through price adjustments. EBIT of the Plastics Packaging segment decreased $1.3 million, or 0.5%, to $247.9 million, compared to $249.2 million in 2000. Increased shipments of plastic containers and closures for food and health care, including prescription products, were more than offset by lower shipments of plastic containers for juice and other beverages and one time costs associated with the relocation of a U.S. manufacturing operation to a new and larger facility to accommodate a growing business base. Eliminations and other retained items, excluding the 2001 and 2000 unusual items, declined $81.3 million from 2000 reflecting lower net financial services income due to the sale of the Companys Harbor Capital Advisors business, higher spending on information systems, and certain employee benefit costs increases. Restructuring and Impairment Charges The 2001 operating results included pretax charges of $90.0 million related to the following: (1) charges of $82.1 million principally related to a restructuring program and impairment at certain of the Companys international and domestic operations. The charge included the impairment of assets at the Companys affiliate in Puerto Rico and the consolidation of manufacturing capacity and the closing of a facility in Venezuela. The program also included consolidation of capacity at certain other international and domestic facilities in response to decisions about pricing and market strategy and (2) a charge of $7.9 million related to restructuring manufacturing capacity in the medical devices business. The Company substantially completed these restructuring programs during 2002. The cost savings from the 2001 restructuring programs were not material. The 2000 operating results included a pretax charge of $248.3 million, principally related to a restructuring and capacity realignment program. The restructuring and capacity realignment program, initiated in the third quarter of 2000, included the consolidation of manufacturing capacity and a reduction of 350 employees in the U.S. salaried work force, or about 10%, principally as a result of early retirement incentives. Also included in the charge was a write down of plant and equipment for the Companys glass container affiliate in India and certain other asset write offs, including $27.9 million for software which was abandoned. Manufacturing capacity consolidations principally involved U.S. glass container facilities and reflected technology driven improvements in productivity, conversions of some juice and similar products to plastic containers, decisions regarding pricing and volume, and the further concentration of production in the most strategically located facilities. The 2000 restructuring and capacity realignment program was substantially completed at the end of 2002. 26  Asbestos Related Charge The asbestos related charge of $475.0 million ($308.8 million after tax) represented an adjustment of the reserve for estimated future asbestos related costs. Following the completion of a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs in April 2002, the Company concluded that an increase in the reserve was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims expected to be filed in the next several years. Asbestos related cash payments were $221.1 million for 2002, down from $245.9 million for 2001. The Company expects that asbestos related cash payments will be moderately lower in 2003. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other resources will be sufficient to meet all asbestos related obligations. The Company believes that its ultimate asbestos related contingent liability (i.e., its indemnity or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees) cannot be estimated with certainty. The Companys ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the United States, the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation and found liable for substantial damage awards, the continued use of litigation screenings to generate new lawsuits, the large number of claims asserted or filed by parties who claim prior exposure to asbestos materials but have no present physical impairment as a result of such exposure, and the growing number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy. The Company continues to monitor trends which may affect its ultimate liability and has continued to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the Company. As a result, the Company continues to evaluate trends to determine whether future adjustments of the asbestos related liabilities may be appropriate. A former business unit of the Company produced a minor amount of specialized high temperature insulation material containing asbestos from 1948 until 1958, when the business was sold. In line with its limited involvement with an asbestos containing product and its exit from that business over 44 years ago, the Company will continue to work aggressively to minimize the number of incoming cases and to limit payments to only those impaired claimants who were exposed to the Companys products and whose claims have merit under applicable state law. As of December 31, 2002, the number of pending asbestos related claimants and plaintiffs decreased to approximately 24,000 from the previously reported level of approximately 27,000 at December 31, 2001. See Note 19 to the consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Capital Resources and Liquidity The Companys total debt at December 31, 2002 was $5.35 billion, compared to $5.40 billion at December 31, 2001. During April 2001, certain of the Companys subsidiaries entered into the Secured Credit Agreement (the "Agreement") with a group of banks, which expires on March 31, 2004. The Agreement provides for a $2.4 billion ($3.0 billion initially) revolving credit facility. The Agreement also initially provided for a $1.5 billion term loan which was repaid with the proceeds from the 2001 sale of the Companys Harbor Capital Advisors business and the issuance of Senior Secured Notes in 2002 as discussed below. At December 31, 2002, the Company had available credit totaling $2.450 billion under the Agreement, of which $520.9 million had not been utilized. At December 31, 2001, the Company had $491.4 million of credit which had not been utilized under the Agreement. Cash provided by operating activities was $603.1 million for 2002 compared to $538.1 million for 2001. During January 2002, a subsidiary of the Company issued $1.0 billion of Senior Secured Notes. The notes bear interest at 87/8% and are due February 15, 2009. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries. The assets of substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries are pledged as security for the notes. The issuing subsidiary used the net cash 27 proceeds from the notes to reduce the outstanding term loan under the Agreement by $980 million. As a result, the Company wrote off unamortized deferred financing fees in January 2002 related to the term loan and recorded an extraordinary charge of $10.9 million less applicable income taxes of $4.2 million. The indenture for the notes restricts, among other things, the ability of the Companys subsidiaries to borrow money, pay dividends on, or redeem or repurchase stock, make investments, create liens, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. During the fourth quarter of 2002, a subsidiary of the Company issued Senior Secured Notes totaling $625 million. The notes bear interest at 83/4% and are due November 15, 2012. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries. The assets of substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries are pledged as security for the notes. The issuing subsidiary used the net cash proceeds from the notes to repay the remaining $65 million of the outstanding term loan under the Agreement and to permanently reduce the revolving credit facility under the Agreement by $551 million. As a result, the Company wrote off unamortized deferred financing fees related to the term loan and the revolver and recorded an extraordinary charge of $4.5 million less applicable income taxes of $1.6 million. The indenture for the new notes has the same restrictions as the Senior Secured Notes issued in January 2002. The $1.625 billion of Senior Secured Notes noted above that were issued during 2002 are part of the Companys plan to obtain longer term financing by issuing long term fixed rate debt. While this strategy extends the maturity of the Companys debt, the long term fixed rate debt increases the cost of borrowing over the shorter term, variable rate debt. The Company expects that the higher cost debt will add approximately $25 million to interest expense in 2003. In 2003, the Company expects to continue refinancing its existing debt, including the Agreement, which may include the replacement of more of its shorter term, lower cost, variable rate debt with longer term, higher cost, fixed rate debt. The Agreement contains covenants and provisions that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets, incur additional indebtedness, prepay other indebtedness or amend certain debt instruments, pay dividends, create liens on assets, enter into contingent obligations, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, make investments, loans or advances, make acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations, change the business conducted, or engage in certain transactions with affiliates and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities. In addition, the Agreement contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and meet specified tests based upon financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, maximum leverage ratios, minimum net worth and specified capital expenditure tests. The Company anticipates that cash flow from its operations and from utilization of credit available through March 2004 under the Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs, debt service and other obligations. The Company expects that its total asbestos related payments in 2003 will be moderately lower than 2002. Based on the Companys expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the Companys expected operating cash flow, the Company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Companys liquidity on a short term or long term basis. 28 The following information summarizes the Companys significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2002 (millions of dollars). Payments due by period Total Less than one year 1 3 years 4+ years Contractual cash obligations: Long term debt $ 5,295.3 $ 29.7 $ 2,568.6 $ 2,697.0 Capital lease obligations 3.4 1.0 2.1 0.3 Operating leases 241.9 66.4 125.3 50.2 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,540.6 $ 97.1 $ 2,696.0 $ 2,747.5 Amount of commitment expiration per period Total Less than one year 1 3 years 4+ years Other commercial commitments: Lines of credit (included in the long term debt in the table above) $ 1,825.0 $ 1,825.0 Standby letters of credit 116.4 $ 116.4 Guarantees 9.0 $ 9.0 Total commercial commitments $ 1,950.4 $ 116.4 $ 1,825.0 $ 9.0 Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, including but not limited to those related to pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, and goodwill. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates. The impact and any associated risks related to estimates and assumptions are discussed within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where estimates and assumptions affect the Companys reported and expected financial results. The Company believes that accounting for pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, and goodwill involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Pension Benefit Plans Because of their historically well funded status, the Companys principal defined benefit pension plans contributed pretax credits to earnings of approximately $83.5 million for 2002 and approximately $97.0 million for 2001. The 2002 decrease in pretax pension credits is attributed to lower expected return on assets and the addition of pension obligations with the acquisition of the Canadian glass container assets of Consumers Packaging Inc. The determination of pension obligations and the related pension credits involves significant estimates. The most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present 29 value of benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on assets used in calculating the pension credits for the year. The Company uses a discount rate based on yields of highly rated fixed income debt securities at the end of the year. At December 31, 2002, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 6.52%. The Company uses an expected long term rate of return that is based on the past performance of the various plans assets and an estimate of the future performance of the assets. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the weighted average expected long term rate of return for all plans was 9.64%. Declines in the stock market over the last few years have reduced the fair value of the Companys pension plan assets, which, in turn, has caused reduced credits to earnings. In 2003, the Company also expects to reduce its assumed rate of return on pension assets to a weighted average expected long term rate of approximately 8.75%. The lower assumed rate, combined with a lower asset base, will cause the pretax credits to earnings to be substantially lower for the full year of 2003 as compared to 2002. The Company expects that these credits will be approximately $50 million, or 60%, lower in 2003 than for 2002. Future effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance. For example, a one half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding the expected return on assets would result in a change of approximately $15 million in pretax pension credits for the full year. In addition, changes in external factors, including the fair values of plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities, could result in possible future balance sheet recognition of additional minimum pension liabilities. The Companys principal pension plan in the United Kingdom had an accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO") which exceeded the fair value of the plans assets at December 31, 2002. As a result, the Company eliminated the prepaid pension asset related to that plan and recorded, as of December 31, 2002, a minimum pension liability of $92.2 million, an intangible asset of $12.1 million, and accumulated other comprehensive loss of $130.7 million. At December 31, 2002, the Companys principal pension plans in the United States and Australia had plan assets with fair values in excess of each plans ABO. If the ABO of these plans exceeds the fair value of their assets at December 31, 2003, the Company will be required to write off most of its prepaid pension asset ($925.5 million at December 31, 2002) and record a liability equal to the excess of the ABO over the fair value of the assets. The noncash charge would result in a decrease in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income component of share owners equity that would significantly reduce net worth. Contingencies and Litigation The Company believes that its ultimate asbestos related contingent liability (i.e., its indemnity or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees) cannot be estimated with certainty. The Companys ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the United States, the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation and found liable for substantial damage awards, the continued use of litigation screenings to generate new lawsuits, the large number of claims asserted or filed by parties who claim prior exposure to asbestos materials but have no present physical impairment as a result of such exposure, and the growing number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy. The Company believes that the bankruptcies of additional co defendants have resulted in an acceleration of the presentation and disposition of a number of claims, which would otherwise have been presented and disposed of over the next several years. The Company continues to monitor trends which may affect its ultimate liability and continues to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the Company. The Company expects to complete a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs in connection with finalizing and reporting its results for 2003, and annually thereafter, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review. If the results of this 30 annual comprehensive review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is insufficient to cover its estimated liabilities, then the Company will record an appropriate charge to increase the accrual. The Companys estimates are based on a number of factors as described further in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill Beginning in 2002, the Company will evaluate goodwill annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed using the business enterprise value ("BEV") of each reporting unit which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free, after tax future cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer. This BEV is then compared to the book value of each reporting unit as of the measurement date to assess whether an impairment exists. The annual impairment testing performed as of October 1, 2002 indicated that there was no impairment of any of the reporting units of the Company. If the Companys projected debt free, after tax cash flows were substantially lower, or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital were substantially higher, the testing may have indicated an impairment of one or more reporting units and, as a result, the related goodwill would have been written down. However, based on the Companys testing as of October 1, 2002, modest changes in the projected cash flows or cost of capital would not create impairment in reporting units. For example, if projected debt free, after tax cash flows were decreased by 5%, or alternatively if the weighted average cost of capital were increased by 5%, the resulting lower BEVs would still exceed the book value of each reporting unit and no impairment would exist. In the event the Company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill, the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth. ITEM 7.(A). QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates, and changes in commodity prices, principally natural gas. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating natural gas prices. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk A substantial portion of the Companys operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities conducted by affiliates in foreign jurisdictions. The primary foreign markets served by the Companys affiliates are in Australia, South America (principally Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela), and Europe (principally Italy, the United Kingdom, and Poland). In general, revenues earned and costs incurred by the Companys major foreign affiliates are denominated in their respective local currencies. Consequently, the Companys reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the Companys affiliates operate. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the reported dollar value of local currency EBIT generally decreases; when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the reported U.S. dollar value of local currency EBIT generally increases. Subject to other business and tax considerations, the Companys strategy is to generally redeploy any affiliates available excess funds through intercompany loans to other affiliates for debt repayment, capital investment, or other cash requirements. Each intercompany loan is denominated in the lenders local currency and the borrower enters into a forward exchange contract which effectively swaps the intercompany loan and related interest to its local currency. Because the Companys foreign affiliates operate within their local economic environment, the Company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with local currency borrowings to the extent practicable where debt financing is required. Considerations which influence the amount of such 31 borrowings include long and short term business plans, tax implications, and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms. In those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency, this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. In those countries where the U.S. dollar is the designated functional currency, however, local currency borrowings expose the Company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. The Companys Secured Credit Agreement requires that all borrowings other than borrowings under certain limited overdraft facilities, be denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2002, U.S. dollar amounts outstanding under the Agreement borrowed by foreign affiliates were: Affiliate location Millions of U.S. dollars Australia $ 701.0 United Kingdom 49.7 $ 750.7 A significant portion of the above borrowings and of the intercompany loans have been swapped into local currencies using currency swaps. The Company accounts for these swaps as fair value hedges. As a result, the changes in the value of the swaps are included in other expense and are expected to substantially offset any exchange rate gains or losses on the related U.S. dollar borrowings. As of December 31, 2002, the Companys affiliate in Australia has swapped $650 million of borrowings into $1,275 million Australian dollars. This swap matures on May 1, 2003, with interest resets every 90 days. The interest reset terms of the swap approximate the terms of the U.S. dollar borrowings. This derivative instrument swaps both the interest and principal from U.S. dollars to Australian dollars and also swaps the interest rate from a U.S. based rate to an Australian based rate. The Companys affiliate in the United Kingdom has swapped $200 million of bank loans and intercompany borrowings into 139 million British pounds. This swap also matures on May 1, 2003, with interest resets every 90 days. This derivative instrument swaps both the interest and principal from U.S. dollars to British pounds and also swaps the interest rate from a U.S. based rate to a British based rate. The Companys affiliates in Australia and in the United Kingdom have also entered in short term forward exchange contracts which effectively swap additional intercompany and external borrowings at each of these affiliates to its local currency. These hedges swap both the interest and principal of additional borrowings in excess of the two major swap contracts mentioned above. As of December 31, 2002, the Companys Canadian affiliate has swapped $60 million of borrowings into $94.7 million Canadian dollars. This swap matures on October 1, 2003. This derivative instrument swaps both the interest and principal from U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars and also swaps the interest rate from a U.S. based rate to a Canadian based rate. The remaining portion of the Companys consolidated debt which was denominated in foreign currencies was not significant. The Company believes it does not have material foreign currency exchange rate risk related to local currency denominated financial instruments (i.e. cash, short term investments, and long term debt) of its foreign affiliates. Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates applicable to its U.S. dollar indebtedness. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in variable interest rates, the Company could, at its option, convert to fixed interest rates by either refinancing variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or entering into interest rate swaps. 32 The following table provides information about the Companys significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2002. Outstanding Fair value (Millions of dollars) Variable rate debt: Secured Credit Agreement, matures March 2004: Revolving Loans, interest at a Eurodollar based rate plus 2.00% $ 1,825.0 $ 1,825.0 Fixed rate debt: Senior Secured Notes: 8.875%, due 2009 $ 1,000.0 $ 1,037.5 8.75%, due 2012 $ 625.0 $ 639.1 Senior Notes: 7.85%, due 2004 $ 300.0 $ 300.8 7.15%, due 2005 $ 350.0 $ 342.1 8.10%, due 2007 $ 300.0 $ 293.3 7.35%, due 2008 $ 250.0 $ 234.4 Senior Debentures: 7.50%, due 2010 $ 250.0 $ 235.0 7.80%, due 2018 $ 250.0 $ 217.5 Commodity Risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations of various commodity prices, most significantly the changes in prices related to natural gas. The Company purchases a significant amount of natural gas at nationally quoted market prices. The Company uses commodity futures contracts related to a portion of its forecasted natural gas requirements. The objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid and the potential volatility in earnings or cash flows from future market price movements. The Company continually evaluates the natural gas market in respect to its future usage requirements. The Company generally evaluates the natural gas market for the next twelve months and continually enters into commodity futures contracts in order to have a portion of its usage requirements hedged through the next twelve months. At December 31, 2002, the Company has entered into commodity futures contracts for approximately 25% of its North American natural gas usage through the end of 2003 (approximately 6,600 MM BTUs). At December 31, 2002, an unrealized net gain of $2.2 million, after tax of $1.2 million, related to these commodity futures contracts was included in Other Comprehensive Income. There was no ineffectiveness recognized during 2002. Forward Looking Statements This document may contain "forward looking" statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. Forward looking statements reflect the Companys current expectations and projections about future events at the time, and thus involve uncertainty and risk. It is possible the Companys future financial performance may differ from expectations due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to the following: (1) foreign currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar, (2) changes in capital availability or cost, including interest rate fluctuations, (3) the general political, economic and competitive conditions in markets and countries where the Company has operations, including disruptions in the supply chain, competitive pricing pressures, inflation or deflation, and changes in tax rates and laws, (4) consumer preferences for alternative forms of packaging, (5) fluctuations in raw material and labor costs, (6) availability of raw materials, (7) costs and availability of energy, (8) transportation costs, (9) consolidation among competitors and customers, (10) the ability of the Company to integrate operations of acquired businesses, (11) unanticipated expenditures with respect to environmental, safety and health laws, (12) the performance by customers of their obligations under purchase agreements, and (13) the timing and occurrence of events which are beyond the control of the Company, including 33 events related to asbestos related claims. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. Any forward looking statements in this document are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Forward looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from expectations. While the Company continually reviews trends and uncertainties affecting the Companys results of operations and financial condition, the Company does not intend to update any particular forward looking statements contained in this document. 34
