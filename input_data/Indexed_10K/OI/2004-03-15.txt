ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations Comparison of 2003 with 2002 Net Sales The Companys net sales by segment (dollars in millions) for 2003 and 2002 are presented in the following table. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2003 2002 Glass Containers $ 4,182.9 $ 3,875.2 Plastics Packaging 1,876.1 1,765.2 Segment and consolidated net sales $ 6,059.0 $ 5,640.4 Consolidated net sales for 2003 increased $418.6 million, or 7.4%, to $6,059.0 million from $5,640.4 million for 2002. Net sales of the Glass Containers segment increased $307.7 million, or 7.9%, over 2002. In North America, a $22.1 million decrease in sales was primarily attributed to a 4.9% reduction in unit shipments. Overall cool and damp weather conditions in the United States and Canada during the spring and summer caused lower demand, principally for beer containers. The North American glass container business also had lower unit shipments of containers for food and beverages, principally juice and teas, as certain of these products continued to convert to plastic packaging. The effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates increased reported U.S. dollar sales of the segments operations in Canada by approximately $19 million. The combined U.S. dollar sales of the segments operations outside of North America increased $329.8 million over 2002. The effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates increased reported U.S. dollar sales of the segments operations in Europe and the Asia Pacific region by approximately $253 million and decreased reported U.S. dollar sales of the segments operations in South America by approximately $29 million. The increase was also partially attributed to a 7% increase in unit shipments and higher prices in the European businesses (principally in Italy and the United Kingdom), higher prices in South America and the Asia Pacific region, and increased unit shipments in Brazil. Overall unit shipments in the Asia Pacific region were about equal to unit shipments for 2002. These increases were partially offset by a less favorable sales mix in the Asia Pacific region and lower unit shipments throughout most of South America, excluding Brazil, and from the effects of a national strike in Venezuela that began in early December 2002 and ended in early 2003. The strike caused energy supply curtailments that forced the Company to temporarily idle its two plants in the country, adversely affecting net sales by approximately $20 million. The effects of the strike primarily impacted the first quarter of 2003. Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment increased $110.9 million, or 6.3%, over 2002. Unit shipments increased by approximately 9.1% overall, led by increased shipments of plastic containers for health care and juices, and closures for beverages, food, juices and healthcare. These increases were offset by lower selling prices in most of the segments businesses and the absence of sales from the closures assets divested in November of 2003. The effects of higher resin cost pass throughs increased sales for 2003 by approximately $87 million compared with 2002. The effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates increased reported U.S. dollar sales of the segments operations in Europe and the Asia Pacific region by approximately $35 million and decreased reported U.S. dollar sales of the segments operations in South America by approximately $9 million. 22 EBIT The Company currently evaluates performance and allocates resources based on EBIT, excluding amounts related to certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations ("Segment EBIT"). The Companys Segment EBIT results (dollars in millions) for 2003 and 2002 are presented in the following table. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2003 2002 Glass Containers $ 658.8 $ 709.0 Plastics Packaging 171.3 258.2 Eliminations and other retained items (86.6 ) (78.0 ) Segment EBIT of the Glass Containers segment for 2003 decreased $50.2 million, or 7.1%, to $658.8 million, compared with Segment EBIT of $709.0 million for 2002. In North America, EBIT for 2003 decreased $107.7 million from 2002. The decrease resulted from higher energy costs of $45.5 million, lower pension income of approximately $32 million and lower unit shipments, particularly beer containers, resulting primarily from overall cool and damp weather conditions in the United States and Canada during the spring and summer, partially offset by higher unit pricing compared to 2002. The Company also took extended Thanksgiving and Christmas shutdowns at its U.S. factories to reduce inventory. The combined U.S. dollar EBIT of the segments operations outside North America increased $57.5 million over 2002. The increase was attributed to increased unit shipments, improved productivity, and higher prices in the European businesses (principally in Italy and the United Kingdom), higher pricing in South America and the Asia Pacific region and increased shipments in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by increased energy costs totaling $34.9 million in Europe, South America and the Asia Pacific region, a less favorable sales mix in the Asia Pacific region, lower unit shipments throughout most of South America, except Brazil, and the effects of a national strike in Venezuela that began in early December 2002. The strike caused energy supply curtailments that forced the Company to temporarily idle its two plants in the country, adversely affecting EBIT by approximately $10 million. The effects of the strike primarily impacted the first quarter of 2003. In addition, the effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates increased reported U.S. dollar EBIT of the segments operations in Europe and the Asia Pacific region by approximately $43 million and decreased reported U.S. dollar EBIT of the segments operations in South America by approximately $6 million. Segment EBIT of the Plastics Packaging segment for 2003 decreased $86.9 million, or 33.6%, to $171.3 million compared to Segment EBIT of $258.2 million for 2002. Unit shipments increased by approximately 9.1% overall, led by increased shipments of plastic containers for health care and juices, and closures for beverages, food, juices and healthcare. However, the change in product mix and lower selling prices for most of the segments businesses more than offset the effects of increased shipments. Other factors that unfavorably affected EBIT in 2003 compared to 2002 were: (1) reduced EBIT of $14.5 million for the segments advanced technology systems business, as a major customer discontinued production in the U.S. and relocated that production to Singapore; (2) the write off of $4.0 million of miscellaneous assets that were no longer being utilized and (3) lower pension income of approximately $8.8 million. Eliminations and other retained items for 2003 were $8.6 million higher than for 2002. The principal reasons for the higher costs were: (1) $4.6 million reduction in pension income; (2) the write off of software initiatives that the Company decided not to pursue; and (3) accelerated amortization of certain information system assets scheduled for replacement in 2004. 23 Consolidated EBIT for 2003 was a loss of $620.7 million and included the following: (1) charges of $720.0 million for goodwill impairment including $670.0 million for the write down of goodwill in the consumer products reporting unit and $50.0 million for the write down of an equity investment in a soda ash mining operation; (2) a charge of $450.0 million to increase the reserve for estimated future asbestos related costs; (3) a charge of $43.0 million for the write down of Plastics Packaging assets in the Asia Pacific region; (4) a loss of $41.3 million on the sale of certain closures assets; (5) a loss of $37.4 million from the sale of long term notes receivable; and (6) capacity curtailment charges totaling $72.5 million which includes $28.5 million for the permanent closure of the Hayward, California glass container factory, $23.9 million for the shutdown of the Perth, Australia glass container factory and $20.1 million for the shutdown of the Milton, Ontario glass container factory. Consolidated EBIT for 2002 was $414.2 million and included a charge of $475.0 million to increase the reserve for estimated future asbestos related costs. These items, which are all discussed further below, were excluded from Segment EBIT because management considered them not representative of ongoing operations. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $490.6 million in 2003 from $437.1 million in 2002. Interest expense for 2003 included charges of $13.2 million for note repurchase premiums and related write off of unamortized finance fees and $3.6 million for the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the reduction of available credit under the Companys previous bank credit agreement. Interest expense for 2002 included a charge of $15.4 million for early extinguishment of debt which was reclassified from extraordinary items as required by FAS No. 145. For more information, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Exclusive of these items in both years, interest expense for 2003 was $52.1 million higher than in 2002. The higher interest expense in 2003 was mainly due to the issuance of fixed rate notes totaling $1.625 billion in 2002 and $900 million in May 2003. The proceeds from the notes were used to repay lower cost, variable rate debt borrowed under the Companys Secured Credit Agreement. Higher debt levels in 2003 also contributed to the increase. Lower interest rates in 2003 on the Companys remaining variable rate debt partially offset the increase. Provision for Income Taxes Excluding the effects of the EBIT charges discussed above and the additional interest charges for early retirement of debt, the Companys effective tax rate for 2003 was 29.0%. Excluding the effects of the 2002 asbestos related charge and the additional interest charges for the early retirement of debt, the Companys effective tax rate for 2002 was 30.1%. The lower effective tax rate in 2003 is principally due to a change in Italian tax laws, including a rate decrease that was enacted late in the fourth quarter of 2003. Minority Share Owners Interest in Earnings of Subsidiaries Minority share owners interest in earnings of subsidiaries for 2003 was $25.8 million compared to $25.5 million for 2002. Net Earnings For 2003, the Company recorded a net loss of $990.8 million compared to a net loss of $460.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The aftertax effects of the items excluded from 24 Segment EBIT and the additional interest charges discussed above, increased or decreased net earnings in 2003 and 2002 as set forth in the following table (millions of dollars). Net Earnings Description Increase 2003 (Decrease) 2002 Impairment of goodwill and write down of equity investment $ (720.0 ) $ Cumulative effect of the change in accounting for goodwill (460.0 ) Increase in the reserve for future asbestos related costs (292.5 ) (308.8 ) Write down of Plastics Packaging assets in the Asia Pacific region (30.1 ) Loss on the sale of long term notes receivable (37.4 ) Loss on the sale of certain closures assets (25.8 ) Shutdown of the Milton, Ontario glass container factory (19.5 ) Shutdown of the Hayward, California glass container factory (17.8 ) Shutdown of the Perth, Australia glass container factory (17.4 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees (10.7 ) (9.6 ) Total $ (1,171.2 ) $ (778.4 ) Comparison of 2002 with 2001 Net Sales The Companys net sales by segment (dollars in millions) for 2002 and 2001 are presented in the following table. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 2002 2001 Glass Containers $ 3,875.2 $ 3,572.3 Plastics Packaging 1,765.2 1,825.7 Other 4.5 Segment and consolidated net sales $ 5,640.4 $ 5,402.5 Consolidated net sales for 2002 increased $237.9 million, or 4.4%, to $5,640.4 million from $5,402.5 million in 2001. Net sales of the Glass Containers segment increased $302.9 million, or 8.5%, over 2001. In North America, the additional sales from the October 2001 acquisition of the Canadian glass container operations and increased shipments of containers for liquor and wine were partially offset by decreased shipments of containers for food, teas and juices. The combined U.S. dollar sales of the segments other operations outside the U.S. increased 2.6% over the prior year. Increased shipments throughout most of the Asia Pacific region and portions of Europe were partially offset by the absence of the glass container operations in India, which were sold in 2001, and the effects of political and economic uncertainty in Venezuela. A national strike in Venezuela that began in early December 2002 caused energy supply curtailments that forced the Company to temporarily idle its two plants in the country, adversely affecting 2002 net sales by approximately $20 million. The effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates increased U.S. dollar sales of the segments operations in Europe and the Asia Pacific region by approximately $90 million and decreased U.S. dollar sales of the segments operations in South America by approximately $60 million. Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment decreased $60.5 million, or 3.3%, from 2001. Increased shipments of plastic containers for food, bottled water, juice and health care and closures for food, 25 juice and other beverages were more than offset by lower unit pricing in some product lines, the absence of sales from several small businesses divested during 2002 and the effects of lower resin costs on pass through arrangements with customers. The effects of lower resin cost pass throughs decreased sales approximately $14 million compared to 2001. EBIT The Companys Segment EBIT results (dollars in millions) for 2002 and 2001 are presented in the following table. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2002 2001 Glass Containers $ 709.0 $ 627.1 Plastics Packaging 258.2 287.2 Other 0.2 Eliminations and other retained items (78.0 ) (57.9 ) Segment EBIT of the Glass Containers segment increased $81.9 million to $709.0 million, compared to $627.1 million in 2001. The combined U.S. dollar EBIT of the segments operations outside the U.S. increased 7.7% over prior year. Increased shipments throughout most of the Asia Pacific region and portions of Europe and moderately improved pricing in Europe were partially offset by lower shipments in Brazil and Colombia, the national strike in Venezuela as discussed above and unfavorable currency translation rates throughout most of South America. In North America, EBIT increased 18% over 2001 principally as a result of the Canadian glass container operations acquired early in the fourth quarter of 2001, moderately improved pricing and product mix, increased shipments of containers for liquor and wine and the recognition of the remaining deferred income associated with the early termination of an energy supply agreement, partially offset by the conversion of certain food and beverage containers to plastic packaging. Segment EBIT of the Plastics Packaging segment decreased $29.0 million, or 10.1%, to $258.2 million compared to $287.2 million in 2001. Favorable effects included increased shipments of plastic containers for food, bottled water, juice and health care and closures for food, juice and other beverages as well as improved manufacturing performance. These favorable effects were more than offset by lower unit pricing in some product lines, a $4.1 million write down of inventories to net realizable value, and discontinued production for a major customer in the advanced technology systems business as the customer moved production from the U.S. to the Far East. The Company commissioned a new factory in the Far East to continue to supply this customer which became fully operational early in 2003. While the Company continues to supply this customer from the new facility, the margins on these products will be lower than in prior periods. The Plastics Packaging segment operates in a number of highly competitive markets and incurred significant pricing pressure during 2002 in some product lines which the Company expected to partially offset by increased unit volume, improved productivity and reduced costs. Eliminations and other retained items decreased $20.1 million from 2001 reflecting lower net financial services income due to the sale of the Companys Harbor Capital Advisors business in the second quarter of 2001 as well as higher information systems spending during the year. Consolidated EBIT for 2002 was $414.2 million and included a charge of $475.0 million to increase the reserve for estimated future asbestos related costs. Consolidated EBIT for 2001 was $1,074.3 million and included the following items: (1) a gain of $457.3 million related to the sale of the Harbor Capital Advisors business; (2) a $10.3 million gain from the sale of a minerals business in Australia; (3) a $2.8 million gain from the sale of the Companys label business; (4) a charge of $31.0 million related to the loss on the sale of the Companys facilities in India; (5) charges of 26 $30.9 million related to special employee benefit programs; (6) a charge of $8.5 million related to certain litigation contingencies; (7) restructuring and impairment charges of $90.0 million as discussed further below; and (8) goodwill amortization of $92.3 million. These items were excluded from Segment EBIT because management considered them not representative of ongoing operations. Net Interest Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased $0.7 million from 2001. The effects of lower short term variable interest rates were mostly offset by the first quarter 2002 issuance of $1.0 billion principal amount of 87/8% Senior Secured Notes due 2009 and the fourth quarter 2002 issuance of $625 million principal amount of 83/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2012. Proceeds from the 87/8% Senior Secured Notes due 2009 and the 83/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2012 were used to repay lower cost, variable rate debt borrowed under the original secured credit agreement. During 2002, the Company wrote off unamortized deferred finance fees related to indebtedness repaid prior to its scheduled maturity and recorded additional charges to interest expense of $15.4 million. During 2001, the Company wrote off unamortized deferred finance fees related to indebtedness repaid prior to its scheduled maturity and recorded an additional charge to interest expense of $6.6 million. Also affecting net interest for 2001 was a net interest charge of $4.0 million related to the resolution of the transfer of pension assets and liabilities for a previous acquisition and divestiture. 27  Provision for Income Taxes During 2001, the Company recorded a $6.0 million income tax charge to adjust liabilities in Italy as a result of legislation passed that year. Excluding goodwill amortization and the other items excluded from Segment EBIT, additional interest charges for the early retirement of debt, the net interest charge related to the resolution of the transfer of pension assets and liabilities for a previous acquisition and divestiture, and the Italian income tax charge, the Companys effective tax rate was 30.1% for 2002 compared to 30.3% for 2001. Net Earnings For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a net loss of $460.2 million compared to earnings of $356.6 million for 2001. The aftertax effects of the items excluded from Segment EBIT, as well as the additional interest charges and tax adjustment discussed above, increased or decreased net earnings in 2002 and 2001 as set forth in the following table (millions of dollars). Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2002 2001 Cumulative effect of the change in accounting for goodwill $ (460.0 ) $ Adjustment of the reserve for future asbestos related costs (308.8 ) Gain on the sale of the Harbor Capital Advisors business 284.4 Gain on the sale of the Companys label business and the sale of a minerals business in Australia 12.0 Restructuring and impairment charges (70.2 ) Loss on the sale of the Companys facilities in India (31.0 ) Special employee benefit programs (19.4 ) Charges to adjust net income tax liabilities in Italy (6.0 ) Charges related to certain contingencies (5.3 ) Write off unamortized deferred finance fees related to indebtedness repaid prior to its scheduled maturity (9.6 ) (4.1 ) Net interest on the resolution of the transfer of pension assets and liabilities for a previous acquisition (2.8 ) Goodwill amortization (92.3 ) Total $ (778.4 ) $ 65.3 Sale of Long term Notes Receivable On July 11, 2003, the Company received payments totaling 100 million British pounds sterling (US$163.0 million) in connection with the sale to Ardagh Glass Limited of certain long term notes receivable. The notes were received from Ardagh in 1999 by the Companys wholly owned subsidiary, United Glass Limited, in connection with its sale of Rockware, a United Kingdom glass container manufacturer obtained in the 1998 acquisition of the worldwide glass and plastics packaging businesses of BTR plc. The notes were due in 2006 and interest had previously been paid in kind through periodic increases in outstanding principal balances. The proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Companys Secured Credit Agreement. The notes were sold at a discount of approximately 22.6 million British pounds sterling. The resulting loss of US$37.4 million (US$37.4 million after tax) was included in the results of operations of the second quarter of 2003. 28 Capacity Curtailments Over the last several years, the Company has significantly improved its overall worldwide glass container labor and machine productivity, as measured by output produced per man hour. By applying its technology and worldwide best practices, the Company has been able to significantly increase the daily output of glass forming machines. As a result of these increases in productivity, the Company has had to close glass plants in order to keep its capacity in balance with required production volumes. In August 2003, the Company announced the permanent closing of its Hayward, California glass container factory. Production at the factory was suspended in June following a major leak in its only glass furnace. As a result, the Company recorded a capacity curtailment charge of $28.5 million ($17.8 million after tax) in other costs and expenses in the results of operations for 2003. The closing of this factory resulted in the elimination of approximately 170 jobs and a corresponding reduction in the Companys workforce. The Company expects to save approximately $12 million per year by closing this factory and moving the production to other locations. The Company anticipates that it will pay out approximately $15 million in cash related to severance, benefits, lease commitments, plant clean up, and other plant closing costs. The Company expects that a substantial portion of these costs will be paid out by the end of 2005. In November 2003, the Company announced the permanent closing of its Milton, Ontario glass container factory. The closing of this factory is part of the Companys previously announced capacity utilization review. This closing is part of an effort to bring capacity and inventory levels in line with anticipated demand. As a result, the Company recorded a capacity curtailment charge of $20.1 million ($19.5 million after tax) in other costs and expenses in the results of operations for 2003. The closing of this factory in November 2003 resulted in the elimination of approximately 150 jobs and a corresponding reduction in the Companys workforce. The Company eventually expects to save approximately $8.5 million per year by closing this factory and moving the production to other locations. The Company anticipates that it will pay out approximately $8.0 million in cash related to severance, benefits, plant clean up, and other plant closing costs. The Company expects that the majority of these costs will be paid out by the end of 2005. In December 2003, the Company announced the permanent closing of its Perth, Australia glass container factory. The closing of this factory is part of the Companys previously announced capacity utilization review. This closing is part of an effort to reduce overall capacity in Australia and bring inventory levels in line with anticipated demand. The Perth plants western location and small size contributed to the plant being a higher cost facility that was no longer economically feasible to operate. As a result, the Company recorded a capacity curtailment charge of $23.9 million ($17.4 million after tax) in other costs and expenses in the results of operations for 2003. The closing of this factory in December 2003 resulted in the elimination of approximately 107 jobs and a corresponding reduction in the Companys workforce. The Company expects to save approximately $9 million per year by closing this factory and eventually moving the production to other locations. The Company anticipates that it will pay out approximately $10 million in cash related to severance, benefits, plant clean up, and other plant closing costs. The Company expects that the majority of these costs will be paid out by third quarter of 2004. The 2001 operating results included pretax charges of $90.0 million related to the following: (1) charges of $82.1 million principally related to a restructuring program and impairment at certain of the Companys international and domestic operations. The charge included the impairment of assets at the Companys affiliate in Puerto Rico and the consolidation of manufacturing capacity and the closing of a facility in Venezuela. The program also included consolidation of capacity at certain other international and domestic facilities in response to decisions about pricing and market strategy and (2) a charge of $7.9 million related to restructuring manufacturing capacity in the medical devices 29 business. The Company substantially completed these restructuring programs during 2002. The cost savings from the 2001 restructuring program were not material. Sale of Certain Closures Assets During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company completed the sale of its assets related to the production of plastic trigger sprayers and finger pumps. Included in the sale were manufacturing facilities in Bridgeport, Connecticut and El Paso, Texas, in addition to related production assets at the Erie, Pennsylvania plant. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a loss of $41.3 million ($25.8 million after tax) in the third and fourth quarters of 2003. The net cash proceeds from the sale of approximately $44 million, including liquidation of related working capital, were used to reduce debt. The Companys decision to sell its assets related to the production of plastic trigger sprayers and finger pumps is consistent with its objectives to improve liquidity and to focus on its core businesses. Plastics Packaging Assets In August of 2003, the Company initiated a review of its Plastics Packaging assets in the Asia Pacific region. The review was completed during the fourth quarter of 2003. The Company used a combination of estimated divestment cash flows, which included bid prices from potential purchasers, and partial liquidation values for certain assets to determine the net realizable values of the assets. The Company compared the estimated net realizable values to the book values of the asset and determined that an asset impairment existed. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $43.0 million ($30.1 million after tax) to write down the assets to realizable values. Certain of the plastics businesses in the Asia Pacific region operate in highly competitive markets leading to reduced profit margins. In addition, the Companys PET container business has lost a significant amount of business in the past few years. The reduced business and overall excess capacity in the industry has caused a reduction in the overall value of the business. The Company has entered into an agreement to sell a significant portion of its Asia Pacific plastic business for approximately $60 million (excluding PET container operations). The sale of this business is subject to certain regulatory and other approvals. Impairment of Goodwill and Write down of Equity Investment During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company completed its annual impairment testing and determined that an impairment existed in the goodwill of its consumer products reporting unit. The consumer products unit operates in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. During the course of 2003, a number of the product lines within this reporting unit experienced price reductions, principally as a result of the Companys strategy to preserve and expand market share. The reduced pricing, along with continued capital expenditures, caused the Company to lower its earnings and cash flow projections for the consumer products reporting unit for several years following the measurement date (October 1, 2003) resulting in an estimated fair value for the unit that was lower than its book value. Following a review of the valuation of the units identifiable assets, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $670.0 million to reduce the reported value of its goodwill. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company also determined that the value of its 25% investment in a North American soda ash mining operation was impaired and not likely to recover. Increasing global competition and recent development of foreign sources of soda ash have created significant excess capacity in that industry. The resulting competitive environment caused management of the soda ash mining operation to significantly lower its projections of earnings and cash flows. Following an evaluation of future estimated earnings and cash flows, the Company determined that its carrying value should be written down to estimated fair value and recorded a $50 million charge in the fourth quarter which substantially reduced the carrying value of this equity method investment. 30 Asbestos Related Costs The charge for asbestos related costs of $450.0 million ($292.5 million after tax), recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003, represented an increase in the accrued liability for estimated future asbestos related costs. Following the completion of a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs during the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company concluded that an increase in the accrued liability was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims pending and expected to be filed in the next several years. Asbestos related cash payments for 2003 were $199.0 million, a reduction of $22.1 million, or 10%, from 2002. During 2003, the Company disposed of approximately 21,000 claims. Certain dispositions in 2003 and prior years have included deferred amounts payable over periods ranging up to seven years. Deferred amounts payable at December 31, 2003 were approximately $87 million compared with approximately $50 million at December 31, 2002. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet all asbestos related obligations on a short term and long term basis. As of December 31, 2003, the number of asbestos related claims pending against the Company was approximately 29,000, up from approximately 24,000 pending claims at December 31, 2002. In the second quarter of 2003, the Company received approximately 7,000 new filings in advance of the effective date of the recently enacted Mississippi tort reform law. Approximately 60% of those filings are cases with exposure dates after the Companys 1958 exit from the business for which the Company takes the position that it has no liability. A former business unit of the Company produced a minor amount of specialized high temperature insulation material containing asbestos from 1948 until 1958, when the business was sold. In line with its limited involvement with an asbestos containing product and its exit from that business over 45 years ago, the Company will continue to work aggressively to minimize the number of incoming cases and will continue to limit payments to only those impaired claimants who were exposed to the Companys products and whose claims have merit under applicable state law. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Pending Acquisition On February 18, 2004, the Company announced that it has entered into exclusive negotiations to acquire BSN Glasspack, S.A., the second largest glass container manufacturer in Europe, from Glasspack Participations, a company controlled by investment funds advised by CVC Capital Partners Europe. Total consideration for the acquisition would be approximately 1,160 million euros (US$1,460 million) in cash, including the assumption of approximately $590 million of debt. The Company is currently in negotiations with its lenders in order to amend the Secured Credit Agreement to allow additional borrowings to fund the balance of the total consideration and provide for seasonal working capital needs. BSN has successfully concluded consultations with the appropriate employee workers councils in accordance with applicable labor laws. The acquisition would be subject to regulatory approval, with the closing expected in the second quarter of 2004. BSN owns and operates 19 plants located in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, principally serving the wine and spirits, other beverages including beer, and specialty food industries. Based on 2003 sales, the acquisition of BSN would have increased the Companys glass container sales approximately 38%. After the acquisition is completed, the Company will have approximately $1.5 billion of additional debt outstanding and its interest expense will increase accordingly. However, the Company expects the transaction to be accretive to earnings and cash flow in the first year, before synergies. 31 Capital Resources and Liquidity Current and Long Term Debt The Companys total debt at December 31, 2003 was $5.43 billion, compared to $5.35 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in the total debt from 2002 to 2003 was primarily the result of reduced cash provided by operating activities, principally working capital, as discussed further below. On June 13, 2003, the Companys subsidiary borrowers entered into an Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement (the "Agreement") which provides for up to $1.9 billion of borrowings. The Agreement consists of a $600 million revolving credit facility and a $460 million A term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of April 1, 2007, and an $840 million B term loan, which has a final maturity date of April 1, 2008. Proceeds from borrowings under the Agreement were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the Companys $1.9 billion previous credit agreement which had been scheduled to mature on March 31, 2004. At December 31, 2003, the Company had available credit totaling $1.9 billion under the Agreement, of which $438.1 million had not been utilized. During May 2003, a subsidiary of the Company issued Senior Secured Notes totaling $450 million and Senior Notes totaling $450 million. The notes bear interest at 7.75% and 8.25%, respectively, and are due May 15, 2011 and May 15, 2013, respectively. Both series of notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries. In addition, the assets of substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries are pledged as security for the Senior Secured Notes. The indentures for the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes and the 8.25% Senior Notes have substantially the same restrictions as the previously issued 8.875% and 8.75% Senior Secured Notes. The issuing subsidiary used the net proceeds from the notes of approximately $880 million to purchase in a tender offer $263.5 million of the $300 million 7.85% Senior Notes due 2004 and repay borrowings under the previous credit agreement. Concurrently, available credit under the previous credit agreement was reduced to approximately $1.9 billion. As part of the issuance of these notes and the related tender offer, the Company recorded in the second quarter of 2003 additional interest charges of $13.2 million for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees and $3.6 million for the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the reduction of available credit under the previous credit agreement. The Senior Secured Notes totaling $2.075 billion and Senior Notes totaling $450 million that were issued during 2002 and 2003 were part of the Companys plan to improve financial flexibility by issuing long term fixed rate debt. While this strategy extended the maturity of the Companys debt, long term fixed rate debt increases the cost of borrowing compared to shorter term, variable rate debt. The Agreement contains covenants and provisions that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets, incur additional indebtedness, prepay other indebtedness or amend certain debt instruments, pay dividends, create liens on assets, enter into contingent obligations, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, make investments, loans or advances, make acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations, change the business conducted, or engage in certain transactions with affiliates and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities. In addition, the Agreement contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and meet specified tests based upon financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, maximum leverage ratios, minimum net worth and specified capital expenditure tests. The Company anticipates that cash flow from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs, debt service and other obligations on a short term and long term basis. 32 Cash Flows For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company paid $470.6 million in cash interest compared with $372.1 million for 2002. The increase in cash interest paid is due in part to the issuance of the Senior Secured and Senior Notes discussed above. The increase is also due to overall higher levels of debt. These increases were partially offset by lower overall interest rates on the Companys variable rate debt borrowed under the Agreement. The Company expects that the effects of additional higher cost fixed rate debt will add approximately $22 million to interest expense for full year of 2004 compared to the full year of 2003. As discussed further below, the Company has implemented an ongoing program to swap up to $1.2 billion of fixed rate debt into floating rate debt. The Company expects that this program will save approximately $26 million in cash interest paid during 2004. Following the expected acquisition of BSN, the Companys cash interest payments will increase substantially as a result of the additional borrowings and assumed debt. The amount of such additional payments will depend partially on future interest rates, however, based on rates in effect at the end of 2003, the Company expects cash interest payments to increase by approximately $75 million on an annual basis. Asbestos related payments for 2003 decreased $22.1 million, or 10.0%, to $199.0 million, compared with $221.1 million for 2002. The Company expects that its total asbestos related payments in 2004 will be moderately lower than 2003. Based on the Companys expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the Companys expected operating cash flow, the Company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Companys liquidity on a short term or long term basis. For 2003, cash provided by operating activities was $353.1 million compared with $603.1 million for 2002. The decrease is due in part to an overall increase in working capital. The increase in working capital is partially due to an increase in inventories in domestic glass container operations partially due to lower shipments. Inventory levels in domestic plastic containers and the Australian glass container operations were also higher, as compared to the prior year. An increase in accounts receivable for certain European affiliates and for the Companys affiliate in Brazil was the result of increased sales. Cash flow in 2003 also lacks the benefit of a significant collection of past due accounts receivable from the Canadian acquisition which were collected in 2002. During 2004, the Company is continuing its focus on reducing inventory levels around the world and reducing accounts receivable balances by vigorously pursing past due receivables. For 2003, the Companys capital spending for additions to property, plant and equipment was $431.5 million compared with $496.0 million for 2002. The Company continues to focus on reducing capital spending and improving its return on capital invested by improving capital efficiency. The Company expects to reduce its capital spending on existing facilities during 2004 by limiting the number of expansion projects and only undertaking projects with relatively short payback periods. On July 11, 2003, the Company received payments totaling 100 million British pounds sterling (US$163.0 million) in connection with the sale to Ardagh Glass Limited of certain long term notes receivable as discussed further above. The proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Agreement. For 2003, the Company received $66.7 million from divestitures and other asset sales compared with $39.0 million in 2002. Included in 2003 was approximately $50 million from the divestiture of certain closures assets as discussed above. The Company has retained advisors to conduct a strategic review of certain of its blow molded plastics operations in North America, South America and Europe. The review may result in the divestiture of portions of this business that do not meet the Companys overall strategic plans. 33 For 2003, the Company paid $44.5 million in finance fees related to the issuance of the Senior Secured and Senior Notes discussed above as well as the refinancing of the Agreement. The Company paid $27.7 million in 2002 for the issuance of Senior Secured Notes. During 2003, the Company also paid and expensed $13.2 million of tender offer premiums. For 2003, the Company paid $123.1 million related to debt hedging activity compared to $70.9 million in 2002. As discussed further below, the Companys strategy is to use currency and interest rate swaps to convert U.S. dollar borrowings by the Companys international subsidiaries, principally in Australia, into local currency borrowings. During 2003, as a result of the U.S. dollars decline against several foreign currencies, including the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar, the Company paid significant amounts to settle these swaps at their maturity. The increase from prior year is largely due to a significantly larger decline in the U.S. dollar against the foreign currencies. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following information summarizes the Companys significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2003 (millions of dollars). 34  Payments due by period Total Less than one year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Contractual cash obligations: Long term debt $ 5,394.0 $ 62.7 $ 428.9 $ 1,870.4 $ 3,032.0 Capital lease obligations 2.9 1.1 1.4 0.4 Operating leases 245.2 72.7 94.5 46.1 31.9 Pension benefit plan contributions 33.9 33.9 Postretirement benefit plan benefit payments 292.4 30.6 60.8 59.7 141.3 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,968.4 $ 201.0 $ 585.6 $ 1,976.6 $ 3,205.2 Amount of commitment expiration per period Total Less than one year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Other commercial commitments: Standby letters of credit $ 125.4 $ 125.4 Guarantees 9.0 $ 9.0 Total commercial commitments $ 134.4 $ 125.4 $ $ $ 9.0 At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had no material off balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, including but not limited to those related to pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, goodwill, and deferred tax assets. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates. The impact and any associated risks related to estimates and assumptions are discussed within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where estimates and assumptions affect the Companys reported and expected financial results. The Company believes that accounting for pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, goodwill, and deferred tax assets involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Pension Benefit Plans Because of their historically well funded status, the Companys principal defined benefit pension plans contributed pretax credits to earnings of approximately $29.9 million for 2003 and approximately $83.5 million for 2002. The 2003 decrease in pretax pension credits is attributed to several factors discussed below. The determination of pension obligations and the related pension credits involves significant estimates. The most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on assets used in calculating the 35 pension credits for the year. The Company uses discount rates based on yields of highly rated fixed income debt securities at the end of the year. At December 31, 2003, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 6.1%. The Company uses an expected long term rate of return on assets that is based on both past performance of the various plans assets and estimated future performance of the assets. Past performance of the Companys pension plan assets has been particularly volatile in the last four years. Investment returns exceeded 20% during 2003 but were negative in each of the years 2000 2002. The Company refers to average historical returns over longer periods (up to 10 years) in setting its rates of return because short term fluctuations in market value do not reflect the rates of return the Company expects to achieve based upon its long term investing strategy. For 2003, the Company reduced its assumed rate of return on pension assets to a weighted average expected long term rate of approximately 8.7%, compared to 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The lower assumed rate, combined with a lower asset base, contributed to the lower pretax credits to earnings in 2003. Because of the amortization of previous losses and generally lower discount rates, the Company expects credits to earnings in 2004 to be less than $1.0 million, compared with credits to earnings of $29.9 million in 2003. Future effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance. For example, a one half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding the expected return on assets would result in a change of approximately $16 million in pretax pension credits for the full year 2004. In addition, changes in external factors, including the fair values of plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities, could result in possible future balance sheet recognition of additional minimum pension liabilities. If the Accumulated Benefit Obligation ("ABO") of the Companys principal pension plans in the U.S. and Australia exceeds the fair value of their assets at the next measurement date of December 31, 2004, the Company will be required to write off the related prepaid pension asset and record a liability equal to the excess of the ABO over the fair value of the assets. The noncash charge would result in a decrease in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income component of share owners equity that would significantly reduce net worth. Amounts related to the Companys U.S. and Australian plans as of December 31, 2003 are as follows (millions of dollars): U.S. Salary U.S. Hourly Australian Plans Total Fair value of assets $ 796.2 $ 1,496.4 $ 97.3 $ 2,389.9 Accumulated benefit obligations 748.7 1,358.9 83.9 2,191.5 Excess $ 47.5 $ 137.5 $ 13.4 $ 198.4 Prepaid pension asset $ 354.5 $ 590.4 $ 22.2 $ 967.1 Even if the fair values of the U.S. plans assets are less than ABO at December 31, 2004, however, the Company believes it will not be required to make cash contributions to the U.S. plans for at least several years. Contingencies and Litigation The Company believes that its ultimate asbestos related liability (i.e., its indemnity payments or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees) cannot be estimated with certainty. The Companys ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the United States, the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation and found liable for substantial damage awards, the continued use of litigation screenings to generate new lawsuits, the large number of claims asserted or filed by parties who claim prior exposure to asbestos materials but have no present physical impairment as a result of such exposure, and the growing number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy. The Company 36 believes that the bankruptcies of additional co defendants have resulted in an acceleration of the presentation and disposition of a number of claims, which would otherwise have been presented and disposed of over the next several years. The Company continues to monitor trends which may affect its ultimate liability and continues to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the Company. The Company completed a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs in connection with finalizing and reporting its results for 2003, and expects to conduct a comprehensive review annually thereafter, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review. If the results of the annual comprehensive review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is insufficient to cover its estimated costs, then the Company will record an appropriate charge to increase the accrued liability. Following the completion of its comprehensive review during the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company concluded that an increase in the accrued liability was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims pending and expected to be filed in the next several years. The resulting charge of $450 million ($292.5 million after tax) was reflected in the results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2003. The Companys estimates are based on a number of factors as described further in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill As required by FAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangibles," the Company evaluates goodwill annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. The Company conducts its evaluation as of October 1 of each year. Goodwill impairment testing is performed using the business enterprise value ("BEV") of each reporting unit which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free, after tax future cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer. This BEV is then compared to the book value of each reporting unit as of the measurement date to assess whether an impairment exists. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company completed its annual impairment testing and determined that an impairment existed in the goodwill of its consumer products reporting unit. The consumer products unit operates in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. During the course of 2003, a number of the product lines within this reporting unit experienced price reductions, principally as a result of the Companys strategy to preserve and expand market share. The reduced pricing, along with continued capital investment requirements, caused the Company to lower its earnings and cash flow projections for the consumer products reporting unit for several years following the measurement date, which resulted in a lower BEV. Following a review of the valuation of the units identifiable assets, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $670.0 million to reduce the reported value of its goodwill. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company also determined that the value of its 25% investment in a North American soda ash mining operation was impaired and not likely to recover. Increasing global competition and recent development of foreign sources of soda ash have created significant excess capacity in that industry. The resulting competitive environment caused management of the soda ash mining operation to significantly lower its projections of earnings and cash flows. Following an evaluation of future estimated earnings and cash flows, the Company determined that its carrying value should be written down to estimated fair value and recorded a $50 million charge in the fourth quarter which substantially reduced the carrying value of this equity method investment. If the Companys projected debt free, after tax cash flows were substantially lower, or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital were substantially higher, the testing performed as of October 1, 2003, may have indicated an impairment of one or more of the Companys other reporting units and, as a result, the related goodwill would also have been written down. However, based on the 37 Companys testing as of that date, modest changes in the projected cash flows or cost of capital would not have created impairment in other reporting units. For example, if projected debt free, after tax cash flows had been decreased by 5%, or alternatively if the weighted average cost of capital had been increased by 5%, the resulting lower BEVs would still have exceeded the book value of each reporting unit by a significant margin in all cases except for the Asia Pacific Glass reporting unit. Because the BEV for the Asia Pacific Glass reporting unit exceeded its book value by approximately 5%, the results of the impairment testing could be negatively affected by relatively modest changes in the assumptions and projections. At December 31, 2003, the goodwill of the Asia Pacific Glass reporting unit accounted for approximately $960 million of the Companys consolidated goodwill. The Company will monitor conditions throughout 2004 that might significantly affect the projections and variables used in the impairment test to determine if a review prior to October 1 may be appropriate. If the results of impairment testing confirm that a write down of goodwill is necessary, then the Company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of 2004, or earlier if appropriate. In the event the Company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill, the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth. Deferred Tax Assets FAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which the company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses. In the United States, the Company has recorded significant deferred tax assets, the largest of which relate to the accrued liability for asbestos related costs that are not deductible until paid and to its net operating loss carryforwards. The deferred tax assets are partially offset by deferred tax liabilities, the most significant of which relates to the prepaid pension balance. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for its U.S. tax credit carryforwards, however, it has not recorded a valuation allowance for the balance of its net U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company believes that its projected taxable income in the U.S., along with a number of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses prior to their expiration. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient income from its U.S. operations or implement the required tax planning strategies, or if the Company is required to eliminate deferred tax liabilities in connection with a write off of its pension balance, then a valuation allowance will have to be provided. It is not possible to estimate the amount of the adjustment that may be required, however, based on recorded deferred taxes at December 31, 2003, the related non cash tax charge could range from approximately $90 million to $425 million. The Company will assess the need to provide a valuation allowance annually or more frequently, if necessary. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying existing statutory tax rates to the temporary differences between amounts reported in the financial statements and those reported in the tax return and to the pretax amount of loss carryforwards. During 2003, legislation was proposed in the U.S. that would, among other things, reduce the rate of tax on corporate income. If such legislation is enacted, the Company will be required to revalue its deferred tax assets and liabilities using lower rates. Because the deferred tax accounts are in a net asset position, the result would be a charge to earnings through an increase in the provision for taxes. Based on the Companys U.S. net deferred tax asset position at December 31, 2003, a 1% decrease in the corporate income tax rate would require an increase in the tax provision of approximately $1 million.  ITEM 7.(a). QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates, and changes in commodity prices, principally natural gas. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating natural gas prices. In addition, the Company 38 uses interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of fixed and floating rate debt and to reduce interest expense. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk A substantial portion of the Companys operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities conducted by subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions. The primary foreign markets served by the Companys subsidiaries are in Canada, Australia, South America (principally Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela), and Europe (principally Italy, the United Kingdom, and Poland). In general, revenues earned and costs incurred by the Companys major foreign affiliates are denominated in their respective local currencies. Consequently, the Companys reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the Companys subsidiaries operate. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the reported dollar value of local currency earnings generally decreases; when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the reported U.S. dollar value of local currency earnings generally increases. The Company does not have any significant foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in the U.S. dollar, however, if economic conditions in Venezuela continue to decline, the Company may have to adopt the U.S. dollar as its functional currency for its subsidiaries in that country. Subject to other business and tax considerations, the Companys strategy is to generally redeploy any subsidiarys available excess funds through intercompany loans to other subsidiaries for debt repayment, capital investment, or other cash requirements. Each intercompany loan is denominated in the lenders local currency and the borrower enters into a forward exchange contract which effectively swaps the intercompany loan and related interest to its local currency. Because the Companys subsidiaries operate within their local economic environment, the Company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with local currency borrowings to the extent practicable where debt financing is required. Considerations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans, tax implications, and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms. In those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency, this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. In those countries where the U.S. dollar is the designated functional currency, however, local currency borrowings expose the Company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. The Companys subsidiaries in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and several other European countries have also entered into short term forward exchange contracts which effectively swap additional intercompany and external borrowings at each subsidiary into its local currency. The Companys Secured Credit Agreement requires that all borrowings, other than borrowings under certain limited overdraft facilities, be denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2003, the U.S. dollar amounts outstanding under the Agreement borrowed by the Companys foreign subsidiary in Australia were $460.0 million. A significant portion of the above Australian borrowings and the intercompany loans have been swapped into local currencies using currency swaps. The Company accounts for these swaps as fair value hedges. As a result, the changes in the value of the swaps are included in other expense and are expected to substantially offset any exchange rate gains or losses on the related U.S. dollar borrowings. During the second quarter of 2003, the Companys subsidiary in Australia entered into a number of agreements that swap a total of U.S. $666 million of borrowings into 1,050 million Australian dollars. These derivative instruments swap both the interest and principal from U.S. dollars to Australian 39 dollars and also swap the interest rate from a U.S. based rate to an Australian based rate. These agreements have various maturity dates ranging from April 2004 through May 2005. The remaining portion of the Companys consolidated debt which was denominated in foreign currencies was not significant. The Company believes it does not have material foreign currency exchange rate risk related to local currency denominated financial instruments (i.e. cash, short term investments, and long term debt) of its subsidiaries outside the U.S. 40  Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates applicable to its U.S. dollar indebtedness. The following table provides information about the Companys significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2003. Amount Fair value Hedge value (Millions of dollars) Variable rate debt: Secured Credit Agreement, matures March 2007: Term Loans, interest at a Eurodollar based rate plus 2.00% A Term Loan $ 460.0 $ 460.0 B Term Loan 840.0 840.0 Fixed rate debt: Senior Secured Notes: 8.875%, due 2009 1,000.0 1,095.0 7.75%, due 2011 450.0 478.1 8.75%, due 2012 625.0 692.2 Senior Notes: 7.85%, due 2004 36.5 36.5 7.15%, due 2005 350.0 359.6 8.10%, due 2007 300.0 314.2 $ 301.3 7.35%, due 2008 250.0 255.6 248.8 8.25%, due 2013 450.0 478.1 Senior Debentures: 7.50%, due 2010 250.0 254.4 248.3 7.80%, due 2018 250.0 251.3 Interest Rate Swap Agreements In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $700 million that mature from 2007 through 2010. The swaps were executed in order to: (i) convert a portion of the senior notes and senior debentures fixed rate debt into floating rate debt; (ii) maintain a capital structure containing appropriate amounts of fixed and floating rate debt; and (iii) reduce net interest payments and expense in the near term. The Companys fixed to variable interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. Because the relevant terms of the swap agreements match the corresponding terms of the notes, there is no hedge ineffectiveness. Accordingly, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 the Company recorded the fair market values of the swaps as a net non current liability of $1.6 millon along with a corresponding net decrease to the hedged debt. Under the swaps the Company receives fixed rate interest amounts (equal to interest on the corresponding hedged note) and pays interest at a six month U.S. LIBOR rate (set in arrears) plus a margin spread (see table below). The interest rate differential on each swap is recognized as an adjustment of interest expense over the term of the agreement. 41 The following selected information relates to fair value swaps at December 31, 2003 (based on a projected U.S. LIBOR rate of 1.49%): Amount Hedged Average Receive Rate Average Spread Asset (Liability) Recorded (dollars in millions) Senior Notes due 2007 $ 200.0 8.10% 4.3% $ 1.3 Senior Notes due 2008 250.0 7.35% 3.5% (1.2 ) Senior Debentures due 2010 250.0 7.50% 3.2% (1.7 ) Total $ 700.0 $ (1.6 ) Commodity Risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations of various commodity prices, most significantly the changes in prices of natural gas. The Company purchases a significant amount of natural gas at nationally quoted market prices. The Company uses commodity futures contracts related to a portion of its forecasted natural gas requirements. The objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid for natural gas and the potential volatility in earnings or cash flows from future market price movements. The Company continually evaluates the natural gas market with respect to its future usage requirements. The Company generally evaluates the natural gas market for the next twelve to eighteen months and continually enters into commodity futures contracts in order to hedge a portion of its usage requirements through the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2003, the Company had entered into commodity futures contracts for approximately 75% (approximately 18,000,000 MM BTUs) of its expected North American natural gas usage for the full year of 2004. The Company accounts for the above futures contracts on the balance sheet at fair value. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as, and meets the required criteria for, a cash flow hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI") and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is recognized in current earnings. The above futures contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2003. Hedge accounting is only applied when the derivative is deemed to be highly effective at offsetting anticipated cash flows of the hedged transactions. For hedged forecasted transactions, hedge accounting will be discontinued if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable to occur, and any previously deferred gains or losses will be recorded to earnings immediately. At December 31, 2003, an unrealized net gain of $1.0 million, after tax of $0.5 million, related to these commodity futures contracts was included in OCI. There was no ineffectiveness recognized during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Forward Looking Statements This document contains "forward looking" statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. Forward looking statements reflect the Companys current expectations and projections about future events at the time, and thus involve uncertainty and risk.

It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. Any forward looking statements in this document are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances.
