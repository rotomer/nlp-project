ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview Year ended December 2004 and 2003 Net sales of the Glass Containers segment increased $1,183.2 million as a result of the acquisition of BSN, world wide unit shipment volume growth of approximately 2%, generally higher selling prices, a favorable product mix, and stronger foreign exchange rates in the major regions that the Company does business. Net sales of the continuing Plastics Packaging segment decreased $30.4 million as a result of lower sales resulting from the divestiture of certain closure assets in the 4th quarter of 2003, the divestiture of a portion of the Asia Pacific plastics business in the 2nd quarter of 2004, and lower shipments of prescription vials in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to the strong flu season in the prior year. These negative effects were partially offset by higher unit shipments of closures. Segment Operating Profit of the Glass Containers segment increased by $100.8 million over 2003 as a result of the same principal factors that increased sales. In addition, improved productivity also improved Segment Operating Profit over the prior year, but was partially offset by inflation in the Companys manufacturing and overhead costs. Segment Opertating Profit of the Plastics Packaging segment increased by $16.3 million as a result of favorable product sales mix, improved productivity, and the non recurrence of a third quarter 2003 write off of miscellaneous assets that were no longer being used. Interest expense for continuing operations increased by $45.1 million as a result of the BSN acquisition and from tender offer premiums and the write off of deferred finance fees related to the refinancing of the BSN Senior Subordinated notes and the early retirement of certain outstanding public obligations of the Company. Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $501.6 million over 2003 as a result of the items listed above in Segment Operating Profit as well as a smaller charge in 2004 to increase the Companys asbestos reserve ($84.9 million after tax in 2004 versus $292.5 million after tax in 2003). During 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded several items that management considers not representative of on going operations. The net after tax effect of these items was an increase in earnings of $38.4 million for 2004 and a decrease in earnings of $207.1 million for 2003. The Company completed its acquisition of BSN Glasspack S.A. ("BSN") on June 21, 2004 for a total purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion. The Company completed the sale of its blow molded plastic container operations on October 7, 2004 with total sales proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. Asbestos related cash payments of $190.1 million were lower than the prior year by 4.5%. The Companys total debt at December 31, 2004 was $5.36 billion or $65.1 million lower than the prior year balance. Cash provided by continuing operating activities improved by $239.7 million over the prior year, principally as a result of higher earnings and the Companys focus on working capital reductions and capital efficiency. Results of Operations Comparison of 2004 with 2003 Net Sales The Companys net sales by segment (dollars in millions) for 2004 and 2003 are presented in the following table. The Plastics Packaging amounts reflect the continuing operations and therefore, the 22 results of the discontinued operations have been reclassified from the 2004 and 2003 amounts. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2004 2003 Glass Containers $ 5,366.1 $ 4,182.9 Plastics Packaging 762.3 792.7 Segment and consolidated net sales $ 6,128.4 $ 4,975.6 Consolidated net sales for 2004 increased $1,152.8 million, or 23.2%, to $6,128.4 million from $4,975.6 million for 2003. Net sales of the Glass Containers segment increased $1,183.2 million, or 28.3%, over 2003. In Europe, the Companys largest region, sales increased $939.5 million from 2003. Net sales from the newly acquired BSN business made up $768.6 million of the regions increase. Stronger currency rates against the U.S. dollar for the European currencies also contributed to the sales growth. Unit volumes for the previously owned European businesses were up 2.8% overall with strong growth in the food, beverage and spirit markets. In North America, sales for 2004 were $47.2 million higher than sales in 2003. The higher sales resulted principally from increased selling prices and improved product sales mix as unit shipments declined by about 2% overall. The decrease in unit shipments was more than accounted for by the previously disclosed loss of a beverage container customer. Shipments of beer and malt beverage containers increased by approximately 4.8% over 2003, primarily due to the increase in business from a significant malt beverage customer. Shipments of containers for wine and spirits were also higher for 2004; however shipments of containers for tea, juice and other beverages were lower. In the Asia Pacific region, sales increased $117.7 million from 2003 principally due to unit volumes that were up 2.9% overall resulting from strong growth in beer, wine and low alcohol refreshers partially offset by lower shipments of food containers. In South America, sales increased $78.8 million principally as a result of glass container shipments increasing by more than 5% led by strong growth in the beer and beverage markets. Unit growth was significantly affected by lower exports to North America as a result of the loss of a previously disclosed beverage customer. Excluding the loss of those shipments, overall volume growth in South America was approximately 15%. The change in net sales for the Glass Containers segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 2003 Net sales Glass Containers segment $ 4,182.9 Additional sales from BSN businesses $ 768.6 The effects of sales volume, price and mix 257.5 The effects of changing foreign currency rates on net sales 172.1 Other (15.0 ) Total net effect on sales 1,183.2 2004 Net sales Glass Containers segment $ 5,366.1 Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment decreased $30.4 million, or 3.8%, from 2003. The lower sales primarily reflect the absence of sales from the closure assets divested in the fourth quarter of 2003 and the Asia Pacific plastic operations that were divested in the second quarter of 2004. In addition, sales of containers for prescription packaging were adversely affected due to a milder flu 23 season in December 2004 compared to December 2003. Increased resin prices passed through to customers and stronger currencies in Europe, Brazil and the Asia Pacific region partially offset these reductions. The change in net sales for the Plastics Packaging segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 2003 Net sales Plastics Packaging segment $ 792.7 Divested businesses $ (95.7 ) Effects of higher resin cost pass throughs 24.1 The effects of changing foreign currency rates on net sales 21.0 The effects of sales volume, price and mix 9.7 Other 10.5 Total net effect on sales (30.4 ) 2004 Net sales Plastics Packaging segment $ 762.3 Segment Operating Profit The Companys Segment Operating Profit results (dollars in millions) for 2004 and 2003 are presented in the following table. The Plastics Packaging Segment Operating Profit amounts reflect the continuing operations, and therefore the results of the discontinued operations have been reclassified from the 2004 and 2003 amounts. In addition, certain Glass Container amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2004 2003 Glass Containers $ 759.6 $ 658.8 Plastics Packaging 115.0 98.7 Eliminations and other retained items (102.2 ) (91.9 ) Segment Operating Profit of the Glass Containers segment for 2004 increased $100.8 million, or 15.3%, to $759.6 million, compared with Segment Operating Profit of $658.8 million for 2003. In Europe, Segment Operating Profit for 2004 increased $60.4 million over 2003. The newly acquired BSN business contributed $27.6 million of the increase. Stronger currency rates against the U.S. dollar for the European currencies also contributed to the growth in Segment Operating Profit. In addition, higher unit shipments over 2003 in combination with improved pricing and improved productivity also contributed to the growth. These increases were partially offset by higher energy costs. The Segment Operating Profit contribution from BSN for 2004 includes a reduction in gross profit of $31.1 million related to the impact of the acquisition step up of BSN finished goods inventory as required by FAS No. 141. In North America, Segment Operating Profit for 2004 increased $5.7 million over 2003. The benefits of higher selling prices and a more favorable product sales mix were the principal reasons for the increase. These increases were partially offset by a number of unfavorable effects, including: (1) lower production to control inventories consistent with the Companys working capital goals; (2) increased freight expense reflecting higher diesel fuel costs; and (3) a reduction in pension income. Also contributing to this decline was a 2% decline in unit shipments that was the result of the previously disclosed loss of a beverage customer. This decline in shipments of beverage containers was partially offset by increased shipments of containers for beer, wine, and liquor. 24 In the Asia Pacific region, Segment Operating Profit for 2004 increased $11.8 million over 2003. The effects of overall improved pricing as well as increased unit shipments were partially offset by higher energy costs. The increased unit shipments primarily relate to higher shipments in Australia for containers for wine and beer and increased shipments in New Zealand. In South America, Segment Operating Profit for 2004 increased $22.9 million over 2003. The increase is primarily attributed to increased unit shipments during the year. Unit shipments were higher in Venezuela where shipments increased 30% over prior year and in Ecuador where shipments increased 34% over prior year. In addition to higher unit shipments, the increase is also attributed to a better product sales mix in Brazil as the sales mix moved away from lower margin exports. The change in Segment Operating Profit for the Glass Containers segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 2003 Segment Operating Profit Glass Containers $ 658.8 The effects of sales volume, price and mix $ 107.3 Additional Segment Operating Profit from BSN businesses 27.6 The effect of changing foreign currency rates on Segment Operating Profit 27.0 Improved productivity and other manufacturing costs 3.7 Lower pension income (25.2 ) Higher energy costs (22.8 ) Increased warehouse and other manufacturing costs (18.8 ) Other 2.0 Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit 100.8 2004 Segment Operating Profit Glass Containers $ 759.6 Segment Operating Profit of the Plastics Packaging segment for 2004 increased $16.3 million, or 16.5%, to $115.0 million compared to Segment Operating Profit of $98.7 million for 2003. The increase is primarily attributable to improved productivity and higher unit shipments. Also contributing to this increase was the non recurrence of the third quarter of 2003 write off of miscellaneous assets that were no longer being utilized. These increases were partially offset by higher delivery, warehouse, shipping and other manufacturing costs, as well as lower pension income. The change in Segment Operating Profit for the Plastics Packaging segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 2003 Segment Operating Profit Plastics Packaging $ 98.7 The effects of price,mix, sales volume and production volume $ 7.4 The effect of improved productivity 7.0 The non recurrence of a write off of miscellaneous assets 4.0 Increased delivery, warehouse, shipping and other manufacturing costs (3.6 ) Lower pension income (0.7 ) Other 2.2 Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit 16.3 2004 Segment Operating Profit Plastics Packaging $ 115.0 Eliminations and other retained items for 2004 were $10.3 million higher than for 2003. A reduction in pension income, higher legal and professional services costs in 2004 resulting in part from compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and higher retention of property and casualty losses were the primary reasons for the increase. These increases were partially offset by lower spending on information systems costs as compared to prior year. 25 Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $474.9 million in 2004 from $429.8 million in 2003. Interest expense for 2004 included charges of $28.0 million for note repurchase premiums and $2.8 million for the write off of unamortized finance fees related to debt that was repaid prior to its maturity. Interest expense for 2003 included charges of $13.2 million for note repurchase premiums and related write off of unamortized finance fees and $1.3 million for the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the reduction of available credit under the Companys previous bank credit agreement. Exclusive of these items in both years, interest expense for 2004 was $28.8 million higher than in 2003. The higher interest in 2004 reflects additional interest as a result of higher debt related to the BSN acquisition. Partially offsetting this increase were lower interest expense that was principally the result of savings from the December 2003 repricing of the Secured Credit Agreement and approximately $21 million in interest savings as a result of the Companys fixed to floating interest rate swap on a portion of its fixed rate debt. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2004 was 2.8%. Excluding the effects of items excluded from Segment Operating Profit discussed above, the additional interest charges for early retirement of debt and a tax benefit on an Australian tax consolidation, the Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2004 was 26.9%. The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2003 was 30.5%. Excluding the effects of items excluded from Segment Operating Profit discussed above and the additional interest charges for early retirement of debt, the Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2003 was 27.9%. The lower effective tax rate in 2004 is principally due to a favorable change in the global mix of earnings. Minority Share Owners Interest in Earnings of Subsidiaries Minority share owners interest in earnings of subsidiaries for 2004 was $32.9 million compared to $25.8 million for 2003. The increase in 2004 is primarily due to higher earnings for the Companys subsidiaries in Venezuela, Colombia, and Italy. Earnings from Continuing Operations For 2004, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations of $171.5 million compared to a loss from continuing operations of $330.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The aftertax effects of the items excluded from Segment Operating Profit, the additional interest charges discussed above and the tax benefit on the Australian tax consolidation, increased or decreased earnings in 2004 and 2003 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). 26 Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2004 2003 Gain on the sale of certain real property $ 14.5 $ Gain on a restructuring in the Italian Specialty Glass business 13.1 Gain from the mark to market effect of certain commodity futures contracts 3.2 A benefit for a tax consolidation in the Australian glass business 33.1 Increase in the reserve for future asbestos related costs (84.9 ) (292.5 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees (20.1 ) (9.1 ) Life insurance restructuring charge (5.4 ) Write down of equity investment (50.0 ) Write down of Plastics Packaging assets in the Asia Pacific region (30.1 ) Loss on the sale of long term notes receivable (37.4 ) Loss on the sale of certain closures assets (25.8 ) Shutdown of the Milton, Ontario glass container factory (19.5 ) Shutdown of the Hayward, California glass container factory (17.8 ) Shutdown of the Perth, Australia glass container factory (17.4 ) Total $ (46.5 ) $ (499.6 ) Executive Overview Years ended December 2003 and 2002 For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $330.1 million, or $291.9 million higher than the year ended December 31, 2002 loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change of $38.2 million. The following items reduced 2003 results as compared to 2002 results: The write down of plastics packaging assets in the Asia Pacific region that reduced earnings by $30.1 million ($43.0 million pretax) The loss on the sale of long term notes receivable that reduced earnings by $37.4 million ($37.4 million pretax) The loss on the sale of certain closure assets that reduced earnings by $25.8 million ($41.3 million pretax) The shutdown of three glass container factories in Hayward, California, Milton, Ontario and Perth, Australia that reduced earnings by $54.7 million ($72.5 million pretax). The write down of an equity investment that reduced earnings by $50.0 million ($50.0 million pretax) Also affecting the 2003 results were the effects of higher natural gas costs, reduced pension income, continued price pressure in certain of the Companys Plastics Packaging business, a national strike in Venezuela that lasted from December of 2002 until early 2003 and higher interest expense as further discussed below. The 2003 results were increased as compared to the 2002 results by higher unit prices in most of the Companys Glass Container segment, higher unit shipments of closures and the effects of changing foreign currency rates. Also affecting the comparison, in 2003 the Company recorded a charge to increase the reserve for asbestos related costs that reduced earnings by $292.5 million ($450.0 million pretax) compared to a 2002 charge that reduced earnings by $308.8 million ($475.0 million pretax). A net loss of $990.8 million for 2003 includes a loss from discontinued operations of $660.7 million reflecting an impairment charge of $670.0 million to reduce the reported value of goodwill in the 27 consumer products reporting unit. A net loss of $460.2 million for 2002 reflects earnings from discontinued operations of $38.0 million and a cumulative effect of accounting change of $460.0 million. Results of Operations Comparison of 2003 with 2002 Net Sales The Companys net sales by segment (dollars in millions) for 2003 and 2002 are presented in the following table. The Plastics Packaging amounts reflect the continuing operations and therefore, the results of the discontinued operations have been reclassified from the 2003 and 2002 amounts. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2003 2002 Glass Containers $ 4,182.9 $ 3,875.2 Plastics Packaging 792.7 746.0 Segment and consolidated net sales $ 4,975.6 $ 4,621.2 Consolidated net sales for 2003 increased $354.4 million, or 7.7%, to $4,975.6 million from $4,621.2 million for 2002. Net sales of the Glass Containers segment increased $307.7 million, or 7.9%, over 2002. In North America, a $22.1 million decrease in sales was primarily attributed to a 4.9% reduction in unit shipments. Overall cool and damp weather conditions in the United States and Canada during the spring and summer caused lower demand, principally for beer containers. The North American glass container business also had lower unit shipments of containers for food and beverages, principally juice and teas, as certain of these products continued to convert to plastic packaging. The effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates increased reported U.S. dollar sales of the segments operations in Canada by approximately $19 million. The combined U.S. dollar sales of the segments operations outside of North America increased $329.8 million over 2002. The effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates increased reported U.S. dollar sales of the segments operations in Europe and the Asia Pacific region by approximately $253 million and decreased reported U.S. dollar sales of the segments operations in South America by approximately $29 million. The increase was also partially attributed to a 7% increase in unit shipments and higher prices in the European businesses (principally in Italy and the United Kingdom), higher prices in South America and the Asia Pacific region, and increased unit shipments in Brazil. Overall unit shipments in the Asia Pacific region were about equal to unit shipments for 2002. These increases were partially offset by a less favorable sales mix in the Asia Pacific region and lower unit shipments throughout most of South America, excluding Brazil, and from the effects of a national strike in Venezuela that began in early December 2002 and ended in early 2003. The strike caused energy supply curtailments that forced the Company to temporarily idle its two plants in the country, adversely affecting net sales by approximately $20 million. The effects of the strike primarily impacted the first quarter of 2003. 28 The change in net sales for the Glass Containers segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 2002 Net sales Glass Containers segment $ 3,875.2 The effects of sales volume, price and mix $ 101.6 The effects of the national strike in Venezuela (20.9 ) The effects of changing foreign currency rates on net sales in Europe, Asia Pacific and Canada 271.7 The effects of changing foreign currency rates on net sales in South America (29.3 ) Other (15.4 ) Total net effect on sales 307.7 2003 Net sales Glass Containers segment $ 4,182.9 Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment increased $46.7 million, or 6.3%, over 2002. Unit shipments increased by approximately 10.9% overall, led by increased shipments of closures for beverages, food, juices and healthcare. These increases were offset by lower selling prices in most of the segments businesses and the absence of sales from the closure assets divested in November of 2003. The effects of higher resin cost pass throughs increased sales for 2003 by approximately $19.7 million compared with 2002. The change in net sales for the Plastics Packaging segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 2002 Net sales Plastics Packaging segment $ 746.0 The effect of sales volume, price and mix $ 17.8 Divested businesses (15.3 ) Effects of higher resin cost pass throughs 19.7 The effects of changing foreign currency rates on net sales the Asia Pacific region 26.4 Other (1.9 ) Total net effect on sales 46.7 2003 Net sales Plastics Packaging segment $ 792.7 Segment Operating Profit The Companys Segment Operating Profit results (dollars in millions) for 2003 and 2002 are presented in the following table. The Plastics Packaging Segment Operating Profit amounts reflect the continuing operations, and therefore the results of the discontinued operations have been reclassified from the 2003 and 2002 amounts. In addition, certain Glass Container amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2003 2002 Glass Containers $ 658.8 $ 709.0 Plastics Packaging 98.7 136.0 Eliminations and other retained items (91.9 ) (83.1 ) Segment Operating Profit of the Glass Containers segment for 2003 decreased $50.2 million, or 7.1%, to $658.8 million, compared with Segment Operating Profit of $709.0 million for 2002. In North 29 America, Segment Operating Profit for 2003 decreased $107.7 million from 2002. The decrease resulted from higher energy costs of $45.5 million, lower pension income of approximately $32 million and lower unit shipments, particularly beer containers, resulting primarily from overall cool and damp weather conditions in the United States and Canada during the spring and summer, partially offset by higher unit pricing compared to 2002. The Company also took extended Thanksgiving and Christmas shutdowns at its U.S. factories to reduce inventory. The combined U.S. dollar Segment Operating Profit of the segments operations outside North America increased $57.5 million over 2002. The increase was attributed to increased unit shipments, improved productivity, and higher prices in the European businesses (principally in Italy and the United Kingdom), higher pricing in South America and the Asia Pacific region and increased shipments in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by increased energy costs totaling $34.9 million in Europe, South America and the Asia Pacific region, a less favorable sales mix in the Asia Pacific region, lower unit shipments throughout most of South America, except Brazil, and the effects of a national strike in Venezuela that began in early December 2002. The strike caused energy supply curtailments that forced the Company to temporarily idle its two plants in the country, adversely affecting Segment Operating Profit by approximately $10 million. The effects of the strike primarily impacted the first quarter of 2003. In addition, the effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates increased reported U.S. dollar Segment Operating Profit of the segments operations in Europe and the Asia Pacific region by approximately $43 million and decreased reported U.S. dollar Segment Operating Profit of the segments operations in South America by approximately $6 million. The change in Segment Operating Profit for the Glass Containers segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 2002 Segment Operating Profit Glass Containers $ 709.0 The effects of sales volume, price and mix $ 64.4 Increased warehouse and other manufacturing costs (24.4 ) Higher energy costs (80.4 ) Lower pension income in North America (31.9 ) Lower pension income in Europe and the Asia Pacific region (7.2 ) The effects of the national strike in Venezuela (10.1 ) The effects of changing foreign currency rates on Segment Operating Profit in Europe and Asia Pacific 42.6 The effects of changing foreign currency rates on Segment Operating Profit in South America (5.9 ) Other 2.7 Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit (50.2 ) 2003 Segment Operating Profit Glass Containers $ 658.8 Segment Operating Profit of the Plastics Packaging segment for 2003 decreased $37.3 million, or 27.4%, to $98.7 million compared to Segment Operating Profit of $136.0 million for 2002. Unit shipments increased by approximately 10.9% overall, led by increased shipments of closures for beverages, food, juices and healthcare. However, the change in product mix and lower selling prices for most of the segments businesses more than offset the effects of increased shipments. Other factors that unfavorably affected Segment Operating Profit in 2003 compared to 2002 were: (1) reduced Segment Operating Profit of $14.5 million for the segments advanced technology systems business, as a major customer discontinued production in the U.S. and relocated that production to Singapore; (2) the write off of $4.0 million of miscellaneous assets that were no longer being utilized and (3) lower pension income of approximately $4.4 million. 30 The change in Segment Operating Profit for the Plastics Packaging segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 2002 Segment Operating Profit Plastics Packaging $ 136.0 The effects of price and volume $ (7.5 ) Increased delivery, warehouse, shipping and other manufacturing costs (5.5 ) Lower pension income (4.4 ) Effects of a customer relocating to Singapore (14.5 ) The write off of miscellaneous assets (4.0 ) Other (1.4 ) Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit (37.3 ) 2003 Segment Operating Profit Plastics Packaging $ 98.7 Eliminations and other retained items for 2003 were $8.8 million higher than for 2002. The principal reasons for the higher costs were: (1) $4.6 million reduction in pension income; (2) the write off of software initiatives that the Company decided not to pursue; and (3) accelerated amortization of certain information system assets scheduled for replacement in 2004. Consolidated Segment Operating Profit for 2003 was $665.6 million and excluded the following: (1) a charge of $450.0 million to increase the reserve for estimated future asbestos related costs; (2) charges of $50.0 million for the write down of an equity investment in a soda ash mining operation; (3) a charge of $43.0 million for the write down of Plastics Packaging assets in the Asia Pacific region; (4) a loss of $41.3 million on the sale of certain closures assets; (5) a loss of $37.4 million from the sale of long term notes receivable; and (6) capacity curtailment charges totaling $72.5 million which includes $28.5 million for the permanent closure of the Hayward, California glass container factory, $23.9 million for the shutdown of the Perth, Australia glass container factory and $20.1 million for the shutdown of the Milton, Ontario glass container factory. These items, which are all discussed further below, were excluded from Segment Operating Profit because management considered them not representative of ongoing operations. Consolidated Segment Operating Profit for 2002 was $761.9 million and excluded a charge of $475.0 million to increase the reserve for estimated future asbestos related costs. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $429.8 million in 2003 from $372.2 million in 2002. Interest expense for 2003 included charges of $13.2 million for note repurchase premiums and related write off of unamortized finance fees and $1.3 million for the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the reduction of available credit under the Companys previous bank credit agreement. Interest expense for 2002 included a charge of $9.1 million for early extinguishment of debt which was reclassified from extraordinary items as required by FAS No. 145. For more information, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Exclusive of these items in both years, interest expense for 2003 was $52.2 million higher than in 2002. The higher interest expense in 2003 was mainly due to the issuance of fixed rate notes totaling $1.625 billion in 2002 and $900 million in May 2003. The proceeds from the notes were used to repay lower cost, variable rate debt borrowed under the Companys secured credit agreement. Higher debt levels in 2003 also contributed to the increase. Lower interest rates in 2003 on the Companys remaining variable rate debt partially offset the increase. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2003 was 30.5%. Excluding the effects of items excluded from Segment Operating Profit discussed above and the additional interest charges for early retirement of debt, the Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2003 was 27.9%. The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2002 was 79.7%. 31 Excluding the effects of items excluded from Segment Operating Profit discussed above and the additional interest charges for early retirement of debt, the Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2002 was 28.4%. The lower effective tax rate in 2003 is principally due to a change in Italian tax laws, including a rate decrease that was enacted late in the fourth quarter of 2003. Minority Share Owners Interest in Earnings of Subsidiaries Minority share owners interest in earnings of subsidiaries for 2003 was $25.8 million compared to $25.5 million for 2002. Earnings from Continuing Operations For 2003, the Company recorded a net loss from continuing operations of $330.1 million compared to a net loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change of $38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The aftertax effects of the items excluded from Segment Operating Profit and the additional interest charges discussed above, increased or decreased earnings in 2003 and 2002 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2003 2002 Increase in the reserve for future asbestos related costs $ (292.5 ) $ (308.8 ) Write down of equity investment (50.0 ) Write down of Plastics Packaging assets in the Asia Pacific region (30.1 ) Loss on the sale of long term notes receivable (37.4 ) Loss on the sale of certain closures assets (25.8 ) Shutdown of the Milton, Ontario glass container factory (19.5 ) Shutdown of the Hayward, California glass container factory (17.8 ) Shutdown of the Perth, Australia glass container factory (17.4 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees (9.1 ) (5.7 ) Total $ (499.6 ) (314.5 ) Acquisition of BSN Glasspack, S.A. On June 21, 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of BSN Glasspack, S.A. ("BSN") from Glasspack Participations (the "Acquisition"). Total consideration for the Acquisition was approximately $1.3 billion, including the assumption of approximately $650 million of debt, a portion of which was refinanced in connection with the Acquisition. BSN was the second largest glass container manufacturer in Europe with manufacturing facilities in France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands. The Acquisition was financed with borrowings under the Companys Second Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement (see Note 6). In order to secure the European Commissions approval, the Company committed to divest the Barcelona, Spain, and Corsico, Italy glass plants. The Company completed the sale of these plants in January 2005 and received cash proceeds of approximately &euro;138.2 million. The Acquisition was part of the Companys overall strategy to improve its presence in the European market in order to better serve the needs of its customers throughout the European region and to take advantage of synergies in purchasing and cost reductions. This integration strategy should lead to significant improvement in earnings from the European operations by the end of 2006. Certain actions contemplated by the integration strategy may require additional accruals that will increase goodwill or result in additional charges to operations. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has determined to reduce capacity in one of the acquired plants. During the first half of 2005, the Company expects to conclude the evaluation of its acquired capacity. 32  The total purchase cost of approximately $1.3 billion will be allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based upon their respective fair values. Such allocations will be based upon valuations which have not been finalized. Accordingly, the allocation of the purchase consideration included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2004, is preliminary and includes &euro;577.6 million ($786.6 million at December 31, 2004 exchange rate) of goodwill representing the unallocated portion of the purchase price. The Company expects that the valuation process will be completed no later than the second quarter of 2005. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2004, included six months and ten days of BSN operations. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on June 21, 2004, translated from Euros into dollars at the exchange rate on that date. The initial purchase price allocations may be adjusted within one year of the purchase date for changes in estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (dollars in millions): June 21, 2004 Inventories $ 294.7 Accounts receivable 197.8 Other current assets (excluding cash acquired) 31.8 Total current assets 524.3 Goodwill 696.0 Other long term assets 121.5 Net property, plant and equipment 670.9 Assets acquired $ 2,012.7 Accounts payable and other current liabilities (410.6 ) Other long term liabilities (334.6 ) Aggregate purchase costs $ 1,267.5 The assets above include $71.1 million of estimated intangible assets related to customer relationships, which will be amortized over the next 8 to 12 years. The liabilities above include $72.7 million for the initial estimated costs of certain actions discussed above, substantially all of which relates to employee termination costs and related fringe benefits. Discontinued Operations On October 7, 2004, the Company announced that it had completed the sale of its blow molded plastic container operations in North America, South America and Europe, to Graham Packaging Company. Cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion were used to repay term loans under the Companys bank credit facility, which was amended to permit the sale. The sale agreement included a post closing purchase price adjustment based on changes in certain working capital components and certain other assets and liabilities of the business. Because the level of working capital declined during the several months prior to closing, primarily due to seasonal factors, the Company expects that an amount will be payable to Graham Packaging under this price adjustment provision. The process for determining the amount payable to Graham Packaging has not been completed, however, the Company expects that it will not have a material effect upon results of operations or cash flows. Included in the sale were 24 plastics manufacturing plants in the U.S., two in Mexico, three in Europe and two in South America, serving consumer products companies in the food, beverage, 33 household, chemical and personal care industries. The blow molded plastic container operations were part of the consumer products business unit of the plastics packaging segment. As required by FAS No. 144, the Company has presented the results of operations for the blow molded plastic container business in the Consolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 as a discontinued operation. Interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations based on debt that was required to be repaid from the proceeds. Amounts for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. The following summarizes the revenues and expenses of the discontinued operations as reported in the condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): Year ended December 31, Revenues: 2004 2003 2002 Net sales $ 875.3 $ 1,083.4 $ 1,019.2 Other revenue 7.7 9.0 9.7 883.0 1,092.4 1,028.9 Costs and expenses: Manufacturing, shipping and delivery 754.6 949.3 840.5 Research, development and engineering 16.0 20.2 22.4 Selling and administrative 23.7 33.8 30.7 Interest 45.1 60.8 64.9 Other 22.9 681.0 6.7 862.3 1,745.1 965.2 Earnings (loss) before items below 20.7 (652.7 ) 63.7 Provision for income taxes 27.1 8.0 25.7 Gain on sale of discontinued operations 70.4 Net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations $ 64.0 $ (660.7 ) $ 38.0 Other costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes an impairment charge of $670.0 million to reduce the reported value of goodwill in the consumer products reporting unit, all of which was attributable to the discontinued operations. The sale of the blow molded plastic business resulted in a substantial capital loss, primarily related to previous goodwill write downs that were not deductible when recorded. The gain on the sale of discontinued operations of $70.4 million includes a credit for income taxes of $39.7 million, representing the tax benefit from offsetting a portion of the loss against otherwise taxable capital gains. 34 The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003 included the following assets and liabilities related to the discontinued operations (dollars in millions): Assets: Balance at December 31, 2003 Inventories $ 155.0 Accounts receivable 112.1 Other current assets 14.8 Total current assets 281.9 Goodwill 151.1 Other long term assets 79.2 Net property, plant and equipment 729.2 Total assets $ 1,241.4 Liabilities: Accounts payable and other current liabilities $ 103.0 Other long term liabilities 64.0 Total liabilities $ 167.0 Asbestos Related Costs The fourth quarter 2004 charge for asbestos related costs was $152.6 million ($84.9 million after tax), compared to the fourth quarter 2003 charge of $450.0 million ($292.5 million after tax). These charges resulted from the Companys comprehensive annual review of asbestos related liabilities and costs. In each case, the Company concluded that an increase in the accrued liability was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims pending and expected to be filed during the several years following the completion of the comprehensive review. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" for further information. Asbestos related cash payments for 2004 were $190.1 million, a reduction of $8.9 million, or 4.5%, from 2003. During 2004, the Company disposed of approximately 9,000 claims. Certain dispositions in 2004 and prior years have included deferred amounts payable over periods ranging up to seven years. Deferred amounts payable at December 31, 2004 were approximately $91 million compared with approximately $87 million at December 31, 2003. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet all asbestos related obligations on a short term and long term basis. As of December 31, 2004, the number of asbestos related claims pending against the Company was approximately 35,000, up from approximately 29,000 pending claims at December 31, 2003. In the second quarter of 2003, the Company received approximately 7,000 new filings in advance of the effective date of the recently enacted Mississippi tort reform law. Approximately 60% of those filings are cases with exposure dates after the Companys 1958 exit from the business for which the Company takes the position that it has no liability. The Company anticipates a significant number of the Mississippi cases will be dismissed without prejudice subject to the possibility of such cases being re filed in other jurisdictions. A former business unit of the Company produced a minor amount of specialized high temperature insulation material containing asbestos from 1948 until 1958, when the business was sold. In line with its limited involvement with an asbestos containing product and its exit from that business over 45 years ago, the Company will continue to work aggressively to minimize the number of incoming cases and will continue to limit payments to only those impaired claimants who were exposed to the Companys 35 products and whose claims have merit under applicable state law. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 2004 Non operational Items Mark to Market of Hedge Contracts The Company uses commodity futures contracts related to forecasted natural gas requirements. The objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid for natural gas and the potential volatility in cash flows from future market price movements. The Company continually evaluates the natural gas market with respect to its future usage requirements. The Company generally evaluates the natural gas market for the next twelve to eighteen months and continually enters into commodity futures contracts in order to hedge a portion of its usage requirements through the next twelve to eighteen months. As discussed further below, prior to December 31, 2004, the Company accounted for the above futures contracts on the balance sheet at fair value. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative that was designated as, and met the required criteria for, a cash flow hedge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI") and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged item affects earnings. Any material portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge that was deemed to be ineffective was recognized in current earnings. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company determined that the commodity futures contracts described above did not meet all of the documentation requirements to qualify for special hedge accounting treatment and began to recognize all changes in fair value of these contracts in current earnings. The total unrealized pretax gain recorded in 2004 was $4.9 million ($3.2 million after tax). This change had no effect upon the Companys cash flows. Plastics Packaging Assets In August of 2003, the Company initiated a review of its Plastics Packaging assets in the Asia Pacific region. The review was completed during the fourth quarter of 2003. The Company used a combination of estimated divestment cash flows, which included bid prices from potential purchasers, and partial liquidation values for certain assets to determine the net realizable values of the assets. The Company compared the estimated net realizable values to the book values of the asset and determined that an asset impairment existed. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $43.0 million ($30.1 million after tax) to write down the assets to realizable values. Certain of the plastics businesses in the Asia Pacific region operate in highly competitive markets leading to reduced profit margins. In addition, the Companys PET container business has lost a significant amount of business in the past few years. The reduced business and overall excess capacity in the industry has caused a reduction in the overall value of the business. During 2004, the Company completed the sale of a portion of this business and is continuing to evaluate prospective buyers for the remaining businesses. The Company does not expect to record any further material losses related to this business. 2003 Non operational Items Sale of Long term Notes Receivable On July 11, 2003, the Company received payments totaling 100 million British pounds sterling (US$163.0 million) in connection with the sale to Ardagh Glass Limited of certain long term notes receivable. The notes were received from Ardagh in 1999 by the Companys wholly owned subsidiary, United Glass Limited, in connection with its sale of Rockware, a United Kingdom glass container 36 manufacturer obtained in the 1998 acquisition of the worldwide glass and plastics packaging businesses of BTR plc. The notes were due in 2006 and interest had previously been paid in kind through periodic increases in outstanding principal balances. The proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Companys Secured Credit Agreement. The notes were sold at a discount of approximately 22.6 million British pounds sterling. The resulting loss of US$37.4 million (US$37.4 million after tax) was included in the results of operations of the second quarter of 2003. Capacity Curtailments Over the last several years, the Company has significantly improved its overall worldwide glass container labor and machine productivity, as measured by output produced per man hour. By applying its technology and worldwide best practices, the Company has been able to significantly increase the daily output of glass forming machines. As a result of these increases in productivity, the Company has had to close glass plants in order to keep its capacity in balance with required production volumes. In August 2003, the Company announced the permanent closing of its Hayward, California glass container factory. Production at the factory was suspended in June following a major leak in its only glass furnace. As a result, the Company recorded a capacity curtailment charge of $28.5 million ($17.8 million after tax) in the third quarter of 2003. The closing of this factory resulted in the elimination of approximately 170 jobs and a corresponding reduction in the Companys workforce. The Company expects that a substantial portion of the closing costs will be paid out by the end of 2005. In November 2003, the Company announced the permanent closing of its Milton, Ontario glass container factory. This closing was part of an effort to bring capacity and inventory levels in line with anticipated demand. As a result, the Company recorded a capacity curtailment charge of $20.1 million ($19.5 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2003. The closing of this factory in November 2003 resulted in the elimination of approximately 150 jobs and a corresponding reduction in the Companys workforce. The Company expects that the majority of the closing costs will be paid out by the end of 2005. In December 2003, the Company announced the permanent closing of its Perth, Australia glass container factory. This closing was part of an effort to reduce overall capacity in Australia and bring inventory levels in line with anticipated demand. The Perth plants western location and small size contributed to the plant being a higher cost facility that was no longer economically feasible to operate. As a result, the Company recorded a capacity curtailment charge of $23.9 million ($17.4 million after tax) in other costs and expenses in the results of operations for 2003. The closing of this factory in December 2003 resulted in the elimination of approximately 107 jobs and a corresponding reduction in the Companys workforce. The majority of the closing costs were paid out by the end of 2004. Sale of Certain Closures Assets During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company completed the sale of its assets related to the production of plastic trigger sprayers and finger pumps. Included in the sale were manufacturing facilities in Bridgeport, Connecticut and El Paso, Texas, in addition to related production assets at the Erie, Pennsylvania plant. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a loss of $41.3 million ($25.8 million after tax) in the third and fourth quarters of 2003. The net cash proceeds from the sale of approximately $44 million, including liquidation of related working capital, were used to reduce debt. 37 The Companys decision to sell its assets related to the production of plastic trigger sprayers and finger pumps was consistent with its objectives to improve liquidity and to focus on its core businesses. Write down of Equity Investment During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company determined that the value of its 25% investment in a North American soda ash mining operation was impaired and not likely to recover. Increasing global competition and recent development of foreign sources of soda ash have created significant excess capacity in that industry. The resulting competitive environment caused management of the soda ash mining operation to significantly lower its projections of earnings and cash flows. Following an evaluation of future estimated earnings and cash flows, the Company determined that its carrying value should be written down to estimated fair value and recorded a $50 million charge in the fourth quarter which substantially reduced the carrying value of this equity method investment. Capital Resources and Liquidity Current and Long Term Debt The Companys total debt at December 31, 2004 was $5.36 billion, compared to $5.43 billion at December 31, 2003. The decrease in the total debt from 2003 to 2004 was primarily the result of increased cash provided by operating activities, as discussed further below, partially offset by higher capital spending as a result of the Companys announced investment in a new glass container manufacturing plant in the U.S. The 2004 debt was also affected by several large transactions during the year. The June 21, 2004 acquisition of BSN Glasspack discussed above increased debt by $1.360 billion and the October 7, 2004 divestiture of the blow molded plastic container business discussed above reduced debt by $1.191 billion. In addition, on October 13, the Company received $81.8 million in cash proceeds from the sale of its 20% equity interest in Consol Limited of South Africa, which was used to further reduce outstanding term debt. In 2004, the Company also incurred debt of $105.4 million for finance fees and repurchase premiums related to the financing of the BSN acquisition, the refinancing of the BSN Senior Subordinated Notes and the refinancing of the Companys Senior Notes due 2005. On October 7, 2004, in connection with the sale of the Companys blow molded plastic container operations, the Companys subsidiary borrowers entered into the Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement (the "Agreement"). The proceeds from the sale were used to repay C and D term loans and a portion of the B1 term loan outstanding under the previous agreement. At December 31, 2004, the Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement includes a $600.0 million revolving credit facility and a $315.0 million A1 term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of April 1, 2007. It also includes a $226.8 million B1 term loan, and $190.6 million C1 term loan, and a &euro;47.5 million C2 term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of April 1, 2008. The Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement eliminated the provisions related to the C3 term loan that was canceled on August 19, 2004. The Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement also permits the Company, at its option, to refinance certain of its outstanding notes and debentures prior to their scheduled maturity. At December 31, 2004, the Companys subsidiary borrowers had unused credit of $404.8 million available under the Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement at December 31, 2004 was 5.09%. Including the effects of cross currency swap agreements related to borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement by the Companys Australian, European and Canadian subsidiaries, as discussed in Note 9, the weighted average interest rate was 5.40%. 38 The Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement contains covenants and provisions that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets, incur additional indebtedness, prepay other indebtedness or amend certain debt instruments, pay dividends, create liens on assets, enter into contingent obligations, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, make investments, loans or advances, make acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations, change the business conducted, or engage in certain transactions with affiliates and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities. In addition, the Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and meet specified tests based upon financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, maximum leverage ratios and specified capital expenditure tests. As part of the BSN Acquisition, the Company assumed the senior subordinated notes of BSN. The 10.25% senior subordinated notes were due August 1, 2009 and had a face amount of &euro;140.0 million at the acquisition date and were recorded at the acquisition date at a fair value of &euro;147.7 million. The 9.25% senior subordinated notes were due August 1, 2009 and had a face amount of &euro;160.0 million at the acquisition date and were recorded at the acquisition date at a fair value of &euro;168.0 million. The majority of these notes were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2004 as discussed below. During December 2004, a subsidiary of the Company issued Senior Notes totaling $400.0 million and Senior Notes totaling &euro;225.0 million. The notes bear interest at 6.75%, and are due December 1, 2014. Both series of notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries. The indentures for both series of notes have substantially the same restrictions as the previously issued 7.75%, 8.875% and 8.75% Senior Secured Notes and 8.25% Senior Notes. The issuing subsidiary used the net proceeds from the notes of approximately $680.0 million in addition to borrowings under the Agreement to purchase in a tender offer $237.6 million of the $350.0 million 7.15% Senior Notes due 2005, &euro;159.6 million of the &euro;160.0 million 9.25% BSN notes due 2009 and &euro;127.3 million of the &euro;140.0 million 10.25% BSN notes due 2009. As part of the issuance of these notes and the related tender offer, the Company recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 additional interest charges of $28.3 million for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees. During May 2003, a subsidiary of the Company issued Senior Secured Notes totaling $450.0 million and Senior Notes totaling $450.0 million. The notes bear interest at 7.75% and 8.25%, respectively, and are due May 15, 2011 and May 15, 2013, respectively. Both series of notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries. In addition, the assets of substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries are pledged as security for the Senior Secured Notes. The indentures for the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes and the 8.25% Senior Notes have substantially the same restrictions as the previously issued 8.875% and 8.75% Senior Secured Notes. The issuing subsidiary used the net proceeds from the notes of approximately $880.0 million to purchase in a tender offer $263.5 million of the $300.0 million 7.85% Senior Notes due 2004 and repay borrowings under the previous credit agreement. As part of the issuance of these notes and the related tender offer, the Company recorded in the second quarter of 2003 additional interest charges of $13.2 million for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees and $3.6 million, of which $2.3 million was allocated to discontinued operations, for the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the reduction of available credit under the previous credit agreement. The Senior Secured and Senior Notes that were issued during the past three years were part of the Companys plan to improve financial flexibility by issuing long term fixed rate debt, as well as refinance existing fixed rate debt that was nearing maturity. While this strategy extended the maturity of the Companys debt, long term fixed rate debt increases the cost of borrowing compared to shorter term, variable rate debt. The Company does not intend to continue to refinance variable rate debt with new fixed rate issuances, but will continue to issue long term fixed rate debt in order to repay existing fixed rate debt that is nearing maturity. 39  Cash Flows For 2004, cash provided by continuing operating activities was $544.7 million compared with $305.0 million for 2003, an improvement of $239.7. Cash provided by the change in components of working capital for 2004 was $180.9 million compared to a use of cash of $40.5 million for 2003. Inventories in North American glass container operations were lower than prior year as a result of tighter management of inventory levels as part of the Companys overall focus on working capital improvement. Inventory levels in the Australian and European glass container operations, excluding the BSN Acquisition, were also lower, as compared to the prior year. These lower inventories along with lower accounts receivable, excluding the BSN acquisition and changes in foreign currency rates, are part of the Companys focus on working capital management to improve cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company paid $548.8 million in cash interest, including note repurchase premiums, compared with $458.8 million, including note repurchase premiums, for 2003. The increase in cash interest paid is primarily due to the additional interest related to the BSN acquisition. The interest expense related to the divested blow molded plastic container business has been reclassified to discontinued operations. This increase was partially offset by lower overall interest rates from the December 2003 repricing of the Agreement and from interest savings resulting from the Companys fixed to floating interest rate swap program, as discussed further below, which reduced interest expense by approximately $21 million. Asbestos related payments for 2004 decreased $8.9 million, or 4.5%, to $190.1 million, compared with $199.0 million for 2003. The Company expects that its total asbestos related payments in 2005 will be moderately lower than 2004. Based on the Companys expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the Companys expected operating cash flow, the Company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Companys liquidity on a short term or long term basis. For 2004, the Companys capital spending for additions to property, plant and equipment (continuing operations) was $436.7 million compared with $344.4 million for 2003. The increase is principally related to capital spending at the acquired BSN facilities and the new glass container plant being built in Windsor, Colorado. The Company continues to focus on reducing capital spending and improving its return on invested capital by improving capital efficiency. The Company expects to reduce its capital spending on existing facilities during 2005 by limiting the number of expansion projects and only undertaking projects with relatively short payback periods. For 2004, the Company received proceeds of $1,430.9 million from divestitures and other asset sales compared with $66.7 million in 2003. Included in 2004 were the following items (dollars in millions): Sale of the blow molded plastics business $ 1,191.0 Sale of the 20% investment in Consol Glass 81.8 Restructuring in the Italian Specialty Glass business 42.4 Sale of a portion of the Australian plastics business 53.4 Sale of certain real property 25.2 Other asset sales 37.1 Total proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales $ 1,430.9 Included in 2003 was approximately $44 million from the divestiture of certain closures assets as discussed above. 40 The Company paid $34.4 million in finance fees in 2004 for the issuance of Senior Notes as well as the refinancing of the Agreement. During 2004, the Company also paid and expensed $28.0 million of tender offer premiums. For 2003, the Company paid $44.5 million in finance fees related to the issuance of the Senior Secured and Senior Notes discussed above as well as the refinancing of the Agreement. During 2003, the Company also paid and expensed $13.2 million of tender offer premiums. For 2004, the Company paid $25.9 million related to debt hedging activity compared to $123.1 million in 2003. As discussed further below, the Companys strategy is to use currency and interest rate swaps to convert U.S. dollar borrowings by the Companys international subsidiaries, principally in Australia, into local currency borrowings. The decrease from prior year is largely due to a significantly smaller decline in the U.S. dollar against the foreign currencies during 2004 as well as lower amounts that were hedged during the year. The Company anticipates that cash flow from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs, debt service and other obligations on a short term and long term basis. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following information summarizes the Companys significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2004 (dollars in millions). Payments due by period Total Less than one year 13 years 35 years More than 5 years Contractual cash obligations: Long term debt $ 5,338.6 $ 173.3 $ 700.8 $ 1,729.2 $ 2,735.3 Capital lease obligations 3.6 1.0 1.0 0.8 0.8 Operating leases 270.6 88.5 105.9 51.5 24.7 Contractual purchase obligation 50.5 39.7 10.8 Interest 2,697.4 411.7 799.1 660.9 825.7 Pension benefit plan contributions 37.3 37.3 Postretirement benefit plan benefit payments 243.5 32.3 47.6 46.1 117.5 Total contractual cash obligations $ 8,641.5 $ 783.8 $ 1,665.2 $ 2,488.5 $ 3,704.0 Amount of commitment expiration per period Total Less than one year 13 years 35 years More than 5 years Other commercial commitments: Standby letters of credit $ 165.1 $ 165.1 Guarantees 9.0 $ 9.0 Total commercial commitments $ 174.1 $ 165.1 $ $ $ 9.0 Accounts Receivable Securitization Program As part of the acquisition of BSN, the Company acquired a trade accounts receivable securitization program through a BSN subsidiary, BSN Glasspack Services. The program was entered into by BSN in order to provide lower interest costs on a portion of its financing. In November 2000, BSN created a securitization program for its trade receivables through a sub fund (the "fund") created in accordance with French Law. This securitization program, co arranged by Credit Commercial de France 41 (HSBC CCF), and Gestion et Titrisation Internationales ("GTI") and managed by GTI, provides for an aggregate securitization volume of up to &euro;210 million. Under the program, BSN Glasspack Services is permitted to sell receivables to the fund until November 5, 2006. According to the program, subject to eligibility criteria, certain, but not all, receivables held by the BSN Glasspack Services are sold to the fund on a weekly basis. The purchase price for the receivables is determined as a function of the book value and the term of each receivable and a Euribor three month rate increased by a 1.51% margin. A portion of the purchase price for the receivables is deferred and paid by the fund to BSN Glasspack Services only when receivables are collected or at the end of the program. This deferred portion varies based on the status and updated collection history of BSN Glasspack Services receivable portfolio. The transfer of the receivables to the fund is deemed to be a sale for U.S. GAAP purposes. The fund assumes all collection risk on the receivables and the transferred receivables have been isolated from BSN Glasspack Services and are no longer controlled by BSN Glasspack Services. The total securitization program cannot exceed &euro;210 million ($286.0 million at December 31, 2004). At December 31, 2004, the Company had $207.0 million of receivables that were sold in this program. For the period from June 21, 2004 through December 31, 2004, the Company received $795.9 million from the sale of receivables to the fund and paid interest of approximately $3.6 million. BSN Glasspack Services continues to service, administer and collect the receivables on behalf of the fund. This service rendered to the fund is invoiced to the fund at a normal market rate. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, including but not limited to those related to pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, goodwill, and deferred tax assets. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates. The impact and any associated risks related to estimates and assumptions are discussed within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where estimates and assumptions affect the Companys reported and expected financial results. The Company believes that accounting for pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, goodwill, and deferred tax assets involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Pension Benefit Plans The determination of pension obligations and the related pension expense or credits to operations involves significant estimates. The most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on assets used in calculating the pension charges or credits for the year. The Company uses discount rates based on yields of highly rated fixed income debt securities at the end of the year. At December 31, 2004, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 5.5%. The Company uses an expected long term rate of return on assets that is based on both past performance of the various plans assets and estimated 42 future performance of the assets. Due to the nature of the plans assets and the volatility of debt and equity markets, results may vary significantly from year to year. For example, actual returns were negative for each of the years 2000 2002 while the return was over 20% for 2003 and exceeded 18% in 2004. The Company refers to average historical returns over longer periods (up to 10 years) in determining its expected rates of return because short term fluctuations in market values do not reflect the rates of return the Company expects to achieve based upon its long term investing strategy. For 2004, the Company used a weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension assets of approximately 8.4% compared to 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The Company recorded pension expense totaling approximately $8.7 million for 2004 and pretax pension credits of $29.9 million for 2003 from its principal defined benefit pension plans. The lower pretax credits to earnings in 2004 are principally attributable to a lower asset base, higher amortization of previous actuarial losses and generally lower discount rates (6.10% for 2004 compared with 6.52% for 2003). Depending on international exchange rates and including BSN for the full year, the Company expects to record approximately $3.2 million of pension expense for the full year of 2005, compared with expense of $6.3 million for continuing operations ($8.7 million total) in 2004. Future effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance. For example, a one half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding the expected return on assets would result in a change of approximately $18 million in pretax pension expense for the full year 2005. In addition, changes in external factors, including the fair values of plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities, could result in possible future balance sheet recognition of additional minimum pension liabilities. If the Accumulated Benefit Obligation ("ABO") of any of the Companys principal pension plans in the U.S. and Australia exceeds the fair value of its assets at the next measurement date of December 31, 2005, the Company will be required to write off the related prepaid pension asset and record a liability equal to the excess of the ABO over the fair value of the asset of such plan at the next measurement date of December 31, 2005. The non cash charge would result in a decrease in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income component of share owners equity that would significantly reduce net worth. Amounts related to the Companys U.S. and Australian plans as of December 31, 2004 were as follows (millions of dollars): U.S. Salary U.S. Hourly Australian Plans Total Fair value of assets $ 839.5 $ 1,662.1 $ 101.7 $ 2,603.3 Accumulated benefit obligations 776.1 1,407.8 88.3 2,272.2 Excess $ 63.4 $ 254.3 $ 13.4 $ 331.1 Prepaid pension asset $ 327.6 $ 616.4 $ 21.9 $ 965.9 Even if the fair values of the U.S. plans assets are less than ABO at December 31, 2005, however, the Company believes it will not be required to make cash contributions to the U.S. plans for at least several years. The covenants under the Companys Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement would not be affected by a reduction in the Companys net worth if a significant charge was taken to write off the prepaid pension assets. Contingencies and Litigation The Company believes that its ultimate asbestos related liability (i.e., its indemnity payments or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees) cannot be estimated with certainty. The Companys ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the United States, the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation and found liable for substantial damage awards, the continued use of litigation 43 screenings to generate new lawsuits, the large number of claims asserted or filed by parties who claim prior exposure to asbestos materials but have no present physical impairment as a result of such exposure, and the growing number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy. The Company believes that the bankruptcies of additional co defendants have resulted in an acceleration of the presentation and disposition of a number of claims, which would otherwise have been presented and disposed of over the next several years. The Company continues to monitor trends which may affect its ultimate liability and continues to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the Company. The Company conducts a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs annually in connection with finalizing and reporting its annual results of operations, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review. If the results of an annual comprehensive review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is insufficient to cover its estimated future asbestos related costs, then the Company will record an appropriate charge to increase the accrued liability. The Company believes that an estimation of the reasonably probable amount of the contingent liability for claims not yet asserted against the Company is not possible beyond a period of several years. Therefore, while the results of future annual comprehensive reviews cannot be determined, the Company expects the addition of one year to the estimation period will result in an annual charge. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a charge of $450.0 million ($292.5 million after tax) to increase its accrued liability for asbestos related costs. The factors and developments that particularly affected the determination of this increase included the following: (i) the significant increase in new claim filings in 2003, which the Company believes was caused by anticipation of tort reform legislation in Mississippi and Texas; (ii) the elimination of certain co defendants from the litigation through consensually structured ("prepackaged") bankruptcy filings; (iii) the number of pending serious disease cases and the relatively flat trend line in new filings of serious disease cases; and (iv) the limited success achieved by the Company and its co defendants in eliminating forum shopping, unimpaired claim filings, and other litigation abuses. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a charge of $152.6 million ($84.9 million after tax) to increase its accrued liability for asbestos related costs. This amount was significantly reduced from the 2003 charge due in part to the Companys decision to conduct a comprehensive review annually. The factors and developments that particularly affected the determination of this increase included the following: (i) the modest 4.5% decline in yearly cash outlays; (ii) the significant decline in new claim filings against the Company including a decline in filings of serious disease cases; (iii) the Companys successful litigation record during the year, including a California appellate decision upholding its position regarding its nonliability for post 1958 claims; (iv) significant judicial reform in Mississippi (where approximately 40% of the lawsuits against the Company are pending) and advantageous legislative changes in Ohio affecting unimpaired claimants; and (v) a significant Federal circuit court decision overturning a co defendants prepackaged bankruptcy reorganization. The Companys estimates are based on a number of factors as described further in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill As required by FAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangibles," the Company evaluates goodwill annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. The Company conducts its evaluation as of October 1 of each year. Goodwill impairment testing is performed using the business enterprise value ("BEV") of each reporting unit which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free, after tax projected future cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer. This BEV is then compared to the 44 book value of each reporting unit as of the measurement date to assess whether an impairment of goodwill may exist. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company completed its annual testing and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. If the Companys projected future cash flows were substantially lower, or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital were substantially higher, the testing performed as of October 1, 2004, may have indicated an impairment of one or more of the Companys reporting units and, as a result, the related goodwill would also have been written down. However, based on the Companys testing as of that date, modest changes in the projected future cash flows or cost of capital would not have created impairment in any reporting unit. For example, if projected future cash flows had been decreased by 5%, or alternatively, if the weighted average cost of capital had been increased by 5%, the resulting lower BEVs would still have exceeded the book value of each reporting unit by a significant margin in all cases except for the Asia Pacific Glass reporting unit. Because the BEV for the Asia Pacific Glass reporting unit exceeded its book value by approximately 6%, the results of the impairment testing could be negatively affected by relatively modest changes in the assumptions and projections. At December 31, 2004, the goodwill of the Asia Pacific Glass reporting unit accounted for approximately $1.0 billion of the Companys consolidated goodwill. The Company will monitor conditions throughout 2005 that might significantly affect the projections and variables used in the impairment test to determine if a review prior to October 1 may be appropriate. If the results of impairment testing confirm that a write down of goodwill is necessary, then the Company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of 2005, or earlier if appropriate. In the event the Company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill, the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth. Deferred Tax Assets FAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which the Company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses. In the United States, the Company has recorded significant deferred tax assets, the largest of which relate to the accrued liability for asbestos related costs that are not deductible until paid and to its net operating loss carryforwards. The deferred tax assets are partially offset by deferred tax liabilities, the most significant of which relates to the prepaid pension asset. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for its U.S. tax credit carryforwards and U.S. capital loss carryforward, however, it has not recorded a valuation allowance for the balance of its net U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company believes that its projected taxable income in the U.S., along with a number of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses prior to their expiration. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient income from its U.S. operations or implement the required tax planning strategies, or if the Company is required to eliminate deferred tax liabilities in connection with a write off of its prepaid pension asset, then a valuation allowance will have to be provided. It is not possible to estimate the amount of the adjustment that may be required, however, based on recorded deferred taxes at December 31, 2004, the related non cash tax charge could range as high as $580 million. The Company will assess the need to provide a valuation allowance annually or more frequently, if necessary. 45  ITEM 7.(A). QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates, and changes in commodity prices, principally natural gas. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating natural gas prices. In addition, the Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of fixed and floating rate debt and to reduce interest expense. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk A substantial portion of the Companys operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities conducted by subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions. The primary international markets served by the Companys subsidiaries are in Canada, Australia, South America (principally Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela), and Europe (principally Italy, France, the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Poland). In general, revenues earned and costs incurred by the Companys major international operations are denominated in their respective local currencies. Consequently, the Companys reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the international markets in which the Companys subsidiaries operate. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the reported dollar value of local currency earnings generally decreases; when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the reported U.S. dollar value of local currency earnings generally increases. The Company does not have any significant foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in the U.S. dollar, however, if economic conditions in Venezuela continue to decline, the Company may have to adopt the U.S. dollar as its functional currency for its subsidiaries in that country. Subject to other business and tax considerations, the Companys strategy is to generally redeploy any subsidiarys available excess funds through intercompany loans to other subsidiaries for debt repayment, capital investment, or other cash requirements. Generally, each intercompany loan is denominated in the lenders local currency and the borrower enters into a forward exchange contract which effectively swaps the intercompany loan and related interest to its local currency. Because the Companys subsidiaries operate within their local economic environment, the Company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with local currency borrowings to the extent practicable where debt financing is required. Considerations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans, tax implications, and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms. In those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency, this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. In those countries where the U.S. dollar is the designated functional currency, however, local currency borrowings expose the Company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. The terms of the Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement require that borrowings under the Agreement be denominated in U.S. dollars except for the C2 term loan which allows for &euro;47.5 million borrowings. In order to manage the exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates created by U.S. dollar borrowings by the Companys international subsidiaries, certain subsidiaries have entered into currency swaps for the principal amount of their borrowings under the Agreement and for their interest payments due under the Agreement. At the end of 2004, the Companys subsidiary in Australia had agreements that swap a total of U.S. $455.0 million of borrowings into 702.0 million Australian dollars. These derivative instruments swap both the interest and principal from U.S. dollars to Australian dollars and also swap the interest 46 rate from a U.S. based rate to an Australian based rate. These agreements have various maturity dates ranging from April 2005 through March 2006. The Companys subsidiaries in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and several European countries have also entered into short term forward exchange contracts which effectively swap additional intercompany and external borrowings by each subsidiary into its local currency. These contracts swap both the interest and principal amount of borrowings. The Company recognizes the above derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, and the Company accounts for them as fair value hedges. Accordingly, the changes in the value of the swaps are recognized in current earnings and are expected to substantially offset any exchange rate gains or losses on the related U.S. dollar borrowings. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the amount not offset was immaterial. The fair values are included with other long term liabilities on the balance sheet. In connection with debt refinancing late in December 2004, the Companys subsidiary in France borrowed approximately &euro;91.0 million from Owens Brockway Glass Container ("OBGC"), a U.S. subsidiary of the Company. In order to hedge the changes in the cash flows of the foreign currency interest and principal repayments, OBGC entered into a swap that converts the Euro coupon interest payments into a predetermined U.S. dollar coupon interest payment and also converts the final principal payment in December 2009 from &euro;91 million to approximately $120.7 million U.S. dollars. The Company accounts for the above foreign currency exchange contract on the balance sheet at fair value. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as, and meets the required criteria for, a cash flow hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI") and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged item affects earnings. Any material portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge that is deemed to be ineffective is recognized in current earnings. The above foreign currency exchange contract is accounted for as a cash flow hedge at December 31, 2004. Hedge accounting is only applied when the derivative is deemed to be highly effective at offsetting anticipated cash flows of the hedged transactions. For hedged forecasted transactions, hedge accounting will be discontinued if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable to occur, and any previously deferred gains or losses will be recorded to earnings immediately. The remaining portion of the Companys consolidated debt which was denominated in foreign currencies was not significant. The Company believes it does not have material foreign currency exchange rate risk related to local currency denominated financial instruments (i.e. cash, short term investments, and long term debt) of its subsidiaries outside the U.S. Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates applicable to its U.S. dollar indebtedness. 47 The following table provides information about the Companys significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2004. Amount Fair value Hedge value (Dollars in millions) Variable rate debt: Secured Credit Agreement, matures April 2007 and 2008: Revolving Credit Facility, interest at various rates Revolving Loans $ 30.1 $ 30.1 Term Loans, interest at a Eurodollar based rate plus 2.75% A1 Term Loan 315.0 315.0 B1 Term Loan 226.8 226.8 C1 Term Loan 190.6 190.6 C2 Term Loan (&euro;47.5 million) 64.7 64.7 Fixed rate debt: Senior Secured Notes: 8.875%, due 2009 1,000.0 1,087.5 7.75%, due 2011 450.0 489.4 8.75%, due 2012 625.0 703.1 Senior Notes: 7.15%, due 2005 112.4 113.8 8.10%, due 2007 300.0 317.3 $ 298.2 7.35%, due 2008 250.0 262.5 248.4 8.25%, due 2013 450.0 496.1 440.0 6.75%, due 2014 400.0 407.0 6.75%, due 2014 (&euro;225 million) 306.4 323.3 Senior Debentures: 7.50%, due 2010 250.0 262.5 249.6 7.80%, due 2018 250.0 258.8 Senior Subordinated Notes: 10.25%, due 2009 (&euro;12.7 million) 17.4 18.3 9.25%, due 2009 (&euro;0.4 million) 0.6 0.6 Interest Rate Swap Agreements In the fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $1.25 billion that mature from 2007 through 2013. The swaps were executed in order to: (i) convert a portion of the senior notes and senior debentures fixed rate debt into floating rate debt; (ii) maintain a capital structure containing appropriate amounts of fixed and floating rate debt; and (iii) reduce net interest payments and expense in the near term. The Companys fixed to variable interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. Because the relevant terms of the swap agreements match the corresponding terms of the notes, there is no hedge ineffectiveness. Accordingly, as required by FAS No. 133 the Company recorded the net of the fair market values of the swaps as a long term liability along with a corresponding net decrease in the carrying value of the hedged debt. Under the swaps the Company receives fixed rate interest amounts (equal to interest on the corresponding hedged note) and pays interest at a six month U.S. LIBOR rate (set in arrears) plus a margin spread (see table below). The interest rate differential on each swap is recognized as an adjustment of interest expense during each six month period over the term of the agreement. 48 The following selected information relates to fair value swaps at December 31, 2004 (based on a projected U.S. LIBOR rate of 3.3688%): Amount Hedged Receive Rate Average Spread Asset (Liability) Recorded Senior Notes due 2007 $ 300.0 8.10 % 4.5 % $ (1.8 ) Senior Notes due 2008 250.0 7.35 % 3.5 % (1.6 ) Senior Debentures due 2010 250.0 7.50 % 3.2 % (0.4 ) Senior Notes due 2013 450.0 8.25 % 3.7 % (10.0 ) Total $ 1,250.0 $ (13.8 ) Commodity Risk The Company uses commodity futures contracts related to forecasted natural gas requirements. The objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid for natural gas and the potential volatility in cash flows from future market price movements. The Company continually evaluates the natural gas market with respect to its future usage requirements. The Company generally evaluates the natural gas market for the next twelve to eighteen months and continually enters into commodity futures contracts in order to hedge a portion of its usage requirements through the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2004, the Company had entered into commodity futures contracts for approximately 78% (approximately 17,930,000 MM BTUs) of its expected North American natural gas usage for full year of 2005 and approximately 23% (approximately 5,280,000 MM BTUs) for the full year of 2006. As discussed further below, prior to December 31, 2004, the Company accounted for the above futures contracts on the balance sheet at fair value. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative that was designated as, and met the required criteria for, a cash flow hedge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI") and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged item affects earnings. Any material portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge that was deemed to be ineffective was recognized in current earnings. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company determined that the commodity futures contracts described above did not meet all of the documentation requirements to qualify for special hedge accounting treatment and began to recognize all changes in fair value of these contracts in current earnings. The total unrealized pretax gain recorded in 2004 was $4.9 million ($3.2 million after tax). This change had no effect upon the Companys cash flows. Forward Looking Statements This document contains "forward looking" statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. Forward looking statements reflect the Companys current expectations and projections about future events at the time, and thus involve uncertainty and risk. It is possible the Companys future financial performance may differ from expectations due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to the following: (1) foreign currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar, (2) changes in capital availability or cost, including interest rate fluctuations, (3) the general political, economic and competitive conditions in markets and countries where the Company has its operations, including disruptions in the supply chain, competitive pricing pressures, inflation or deflation, and changes in tax rates and laws, (4) consumer preferences for alternative forms of packaging, (5) fluctuations in raw material and labor costs, (6) availability of raw materials, (7) costs and availability of energy, (8) transportation costs, (9) consolidation among competitors and customers, (10) the ability of the Company to integrate 49 operations of acquired businesses and achieve expected synergies, (11) unanticipated expenditures with respect to environmental, safety and health laws, (12) the performance by customers of their obligations under purchase agreements, and (13) the timing and occurrence of events which are beyond the control of the Company, including events related to asbestos related claims. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. Any forward looking statements in this document are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Forward looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from expectations. While the Company continually reviews trends and uncertainties affecting the Companys results of operations and financial condition, the Company does not intend to update any particular forward looking statements contained in this document. 50
