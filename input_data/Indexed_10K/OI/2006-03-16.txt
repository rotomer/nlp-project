ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview Year ended December 2005 and 2004 Net sales of the Glass Containers segment were $900.8 million higher than the prior year principally resulting from the BSN Acquisition and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment were $49.8 million higher than the prior year. Higher sales from improved pricing, increased sales volume and pass through of higher resin costs were partially offset by the absence of sales from plastic container assets in the Asia Pacific region that were divested in the second quarter of 2004. Segment Operating Profit of the Glass Containers segment was $31.2 million higher than the prior year. The BSN Acquisition accounted for most of the increase. The benefits of stronger foreign currencies and higher selling prices were partially offset by inflationary cost increases. Segment Operating Profit of the Plastics Products segment was $12.2 million higher than the prior year. Increases from improved pricing, sales volume, product mix and a gain from the sale of a plant related to the partial exit from the Australian plastics business more than offset increased costs. Interest expense was $8.2 million lower than the prior year. The decrease resulted from lower debt levels in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 and the non recurrence of repurchase premiums partially offset by higher variable interest rates and higher debt from the BSN Acquisition. Loss from continuing operations in 2005 was $621.6 million, or $4.26 per share (diluted), down from earnings of $171.5 million, or $1.00 per share (diluted), from continuing operations in 2004. Earnings in both periods included items that management considers not representative of continuing operations. These items decreased net earnings in 2005 by $850.9 million, or $5.62 per share, and decreased net earnings in 2004 by $46.5 million, or $0.31 per share. Cash payments for asbestos related costs were $171.1 million, down 10.0% from the prior year. The Companys total debt at December 31, 2005 was $5.30 billion or $63.4 million lower than the prior year balance. Exclusive of the $191.8 million increase in both debt and accounts receivable required by a change in the Companys European accounts receivable securitization program, total debt decreased by $255.2 million to its lowest level since 1998. 32 Results of Operations Comparison of 2005 with 2004 Net Sales The Companys net sales by segment for 2005 and 2004 are presented in the following table. The Plastics Packaging amounts for 2004 reflect only the continuing operations. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Glass Containers $ 6,266.9 $ 5,366.1 Plastics Packaging 812.1 762.3 Segment and consolidated net sales $ 7,079.0 $ 6,128.4 Consolidated net sales for 2005 increased $950.6 million, or 15.5%, to $7,079.0 million from $6,128.4 million in 2004. Net sales of the Glass Containers segment increased $900.8 million, or 16.8%, over 2004. Contributing to the increase were the additional sales from the BSN Acquisition. Increased shipments of beverage containers throughout the Americas more than offset reduced shipments of food containers in North America. Improved pricing also had a favorable effect on net sales. Favorable currency exchange rates accounted for about 5% of the increase. Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of sales from the Castellar factory sold in January 2005. The change in net sales for the Glass Containers segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Net sales 2004 $ 5,366.1 Net effect of the BSN Acquisition, volume, price, and mix $ 883.3 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 46.2 Divestiture of Castellar factory (28.7 ) Total net effect on sales 900.8 Net sales 2005 $ 6,266.9 Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment increased $49.8 million, or 6.5%, from 2004. The higher sales reflected improved pricing and sales volume in several product lines, the pass through effect of higher resin costs, and favorable currency translation rates. Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of sales from plastic container assets in the Asia Pacific region that were divested in the second quarter of 2004. The change in net sales for the Plastics Packaging segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 33 Net sales 2004 $ 762.3 Effect of increased resin cost pass throughs $ 44.8 Net effect of volume, price and mix 34.4 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 3.5 Divestiture (32.9 ) Total net effect on sales 49.8 Net sales 2005 $ 812.1 Segment Operating Profit Operating Profit for product segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. For the Companys U.S. pension plans, net periodic pension cost (credit) has been allocated to product segments. The Plastics Packaging amounts for 2004 reflect only the continuing operations. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Glass Containers $ 790.8 $ 759.6 Plastics Packaging 127.2 115.0 Eliminations and other retained items (89.4 ) (102.2 ) Segment Operating Profit of the Glass Containers segment for 2005 increased $31.2 million, or 4.1%, to $790.8 million, compared with Segment Operating Profit of $759.6 million in 2004. Factors contributing to the increase were: (1) the additional operating profit from the BSN Acquisition; (2) increased unit shipments of beverage containers principally in the Americas; (3) favorable exchange rates; (4) generally improved selling prices; and (5) the non recurrence of the acquisition step up of BSN finished goods inventory. Factors that partially offset the increase were: (1) inflationary cost increases including energy, raw material costs, and transportation; (2) temporarily idled production capacity to reduce inventory; (3) costs of the European integration and new European headquarters; (4) the absence of equity earnings from Consol Limited (divested in the fourth quarter of 2004); (5) the absence of operating profit from the Corsico and Castellar factories; and (6) reduced food container shipments in North America. The change in Segment Operating Profit for the Glass Containers segment can be summarized as follows: 34 Segment Operating Profit 2004 $ 759.6 Net effect of BSN acquisition and volume, price, and mix $ 184.0 Non recurrence of BSN inventory step up 31.1 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 14.5 Higher energy costs (75.7 ) Other inflationary cost increases (57.7 ) Temporarily idled production capacity to reduce inventory (20.5 ) Effects of European integration and new European headquarter costs (18.0 ) Divestiture of Corsico and Castellar factories and Consol investment (13.6 ) Increased delivery and warehousing costs (4.7 ) Other (8.2 ) Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit 31.2 Segment Operating Profit 2005 $ 790.8 Segment Operating Profit of the Plastics Packaging segment for 2005 increased $12.2 million, or 10.6%, to $127.2 million compared with Segment Operating Profit of $115.0 million in 2004. The 2005 amount includes a $6 million fourth quarter gain from the sale of one plant related to the partial exit from the Australian plastics business and a reduction of the accrued exit costs. Also contributing to the increase were the effects of improved pricing, product mix, and sales volume which more than offset the effect of increases in manufacturing, shipping and delivery costs, and the absence of profits from the plastic container assets in the Asia Pacific region that were divested in the second quarter of 2004. The change in Segment Operating Profit for the Plastics Packaging segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Segment Operating Profit 2004 $ 115.0 Net effect of volume, price and mix $ 14.8 Partial exit of Australian plastics business 6.0 Non recurrence plant shut down costs 3.7 Divestiture (4.1 ) Increased delivery, warehousing and other inflationary cost increases (4.2 ) Higher energy costs (1.9 ) Other (2.1 ) Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit 12.2 Segment Operating Profit 2005 $ 127.2 Eliminations and other retained items for 2005 were favorable by $12.8 million compared to 2004. The 2005 year reflects a favorable adjustment of approximately $10.0 million to the Companys accruals for self insured risks, partially offset by higher retained costs for the divested blow molded plastic container business and adjustments made to certain accruals. The 2004 year included self insured property and casualty losses that did not recur in 2005. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased to $466.7 million in 2005 from $474.9 million in 2004. The 2004 amount included $30.8 million for repurchase premiums and write offs of unamortized finance fees. Exclusive of 35 that amount, interest expense increased $22.6 million in 2005 due to higher interest rates on the Companys variable rate debt and additional interest as a result of higher debt related to the BSN Acquisition. Partially offsetting this increase was lower interest as a result of lower average debt balances in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 and lower interest rates on fixed rate debt in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. Provision for Income Taxes Excluding the effects of separately taxed items in both periods, listed in the table below, the Companys effective tax rate for 2005 was 29.9% compared with 26.9% in 2004. The higher 2005 effective rate is principally due to a change in the mix of earnings toward higher tax international jurisdictions, the recent tax legislation in Ohio and recognition of other discrete changes in deferred taxes during 2005. Minority Share Owners Interest in Earnings of Subsidiaries Minority share owners interest in earnings of subsidiaries for 2005 was $35.9 million compared to $32.9 million for 2004. Earnings from Continuing Operations For 2005, the Company recorded a loss from continuing operations of $621.6 million compared to earnings from continuing operations of $171.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The after tax effects of the items excluded from Segment Operating Profit, the tax charge to increase the valuation allowance, the tax benefit of reversing an accrual for potential tax liabilities, the additional interest charges and the tax benefit on the Australian tax consolidation, increased or decreased earnings in 2005 and 2004 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2005 2004 Gain on the sale of the Corsico, Italy glass container facility $ 28.1 $ A tax benefit from the reversal of an accrual for potential tax liabilities 5.3 Gain on the sale of certain real property 14.5 Gain on a restructuring in the Italian Specialty Glass business 13.1 Gain from the mark to market effect of natural gas hedge contracts 2.3 3.2 A benefit for a tax consolidation in the Australian glass business 33.1 Impairment of goodwill in the Asia Pacific Glass unit (494.0 ) Increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance (306.6 ) Increase in the reserve for future asbestos related costs (86.0 ) (84.9 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees (20.1 ) Life insurance restructuring charge (5.4 ) Total $ (850.9 ) $ (46.5 ) Executive Overview Year ended December 2004 and 2003 Net sales of the Glass Containers segment increased $1,183.2 million as a result of the BSN Acquisition, world wide unit shipment volume growth of approximately 2%, generally higher selling prices, a 36 favorable product mix, and stronger foreign exchange rates in the major regions that the Company does business. Net sales of the continuing Plastics Packaging segment decreased $30.4 million as a result of lower sales following the divestiture of certain closure assets in the fourth quarter of 2003, the divestiture of a portion of the Asia Pacific plastics business in the second quarter of 2004, and lower shipments of prescription vials in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to the strong flu season in the prior year. These negative effects were partially offset by higher unit shipments of closures. Segment Operating Profit of the Glass Containers segment increased by $100.8 million over 2003 as a result of the same principal factors that increased sales. In addition, improved productivity also improved Segment Operating Profit over the prior year, but was partially offset by inflation in the Companys manufacturing and overhead costs. Segment operating Profit of the Plastics Packaging segment increased by $16.3 million as a result of favorable product sales mix, improved productivity, and the non recurrence of a third quarter 2003 write off of miscellaneous assets that were no longer being used. Interest expense for continuing operations increased by $45.1 million as a result of the BSN Acquisition and from tender offer premiums and the write off of deferred finance fees related to the refinancing of the BSN Senior Subordinated notes and the early retirement of certain outstanding public obligations of the Company. Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $501.6 million over 2003 as a result of the items listed above in Segment Operating Profit as well as a smaller charge in 2004 to increase the Companys asbestos reserve ($84.9 million after tax in 2004 versus $292.5 million after tax in 2003). During 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded several items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations. The net after tax effect of these items was an increase in earnings of $38.4 million for 2004 and a decrease in earnings of $207.1 million for 2003. The Company completed the BSN Acquisition on June 21, 2004 for a total purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion. The Company completed the sale of its blow molded plastic container operations on October 7, 2004 with total sales proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. Asbestos related cash payments of $190.1 million were lower than the prior year by 4.5%. The Companys total debt at December 31, 2004 was $5.36 billion or $65.1 million lower than the prior year balance. Cash provided by continuing operating activities improved by $239.7 million over the prior year, principally as a result of higher earnings and the Companys focus on working capital reductions and capital efficiency. 37 Results of Operations Comparison of 2004 with 2003 Net Sales The Companys net sales by segment for 2004 and 2003 are presented in the following table. The Plastics Packaging amounts reflect the continuing operations and therefore, the results of the discontinued operations have been reclassified from the 2004 and 2003 amounts. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2004 2003 (dollars in millions) Glass Containers $ 5,366.1 $ 4,182.9 Plastics Packaging 762.3 792.7 Segment and consolidated net sales $ 6,128.4 $ 4,975.6 Consolidated net sales for 2004 increased $1,152.8 million, or 23.2%, to $6,128.4 million from $4,975.6 million for 2003. Net sales of the Glass Containers segment increased $1,183.2 million, or 28.3%, over 2003. In Europe, the Companys largest region, sales increased $939.5 million from 2003. Net sales from the newly acquired BSN business made up $768.6 million of the regions increase. Stronger currency rates against the U.S. dollar for the European currencies also contributed to the sales growth. Unit volumes for the previously owned European businesses were up 2.8% overall with strong growth in the food, beverage and spirit markets. In North America, sales for 2004 were $47.2 million higher than sales in 2003. The higher sales resulted principally from increased selling prices and improved product sales mix as unit shipments declined by about 2% overall. The decrease in unit shipments was more than accounted for by the previously disclosed loss of a beverage container customer. Shipments of beer and malt beverage containers increased by approximately 4.8% over 2003, primarily due to the increase in business from a significant malt beverage customer. Shipments of containers for wine and spirits were also higher for 2004; however, shipments of containers for tea, juice and other beverages were lower. In the Asia Pacific region, sales increased $117.7 million from 2003 principally due to unit volumes that were up 2.9% overall resulting from strong growth in beer, wine and low alcohol refreshers partially offset by lower shipments of food containers. In South America, sales increased $78.8 million principally as a result of glass container shipments increasing by more than 5% led by strong growth in the beer and beverage markets. Unit growth was significantly affected by lower exports to North America as a result of the loss of a previously disclosed beverage customer. Excluding the loss of those shipments, overall volume growth in South America was approximately 15%. The change in net sales for the Glass Containers segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 38 2003 Net sales Glass Containers segment $ 4,182.9 Additional sales from BSN businesses $ 768.6 The effects of sales volume, price and mix 257.5 The effects of changing foreign currency rates on net sales 172.1 Other (15.0 ) Total net effect on sales 1,183.2 2004 Net sales Glass Containers segment $ 5,366.1 Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment decreased $30.4 million, or 3.8%, from 2003. The lower sales primarily reflect the absence of sales from the closure assets divested in the fourth quarter of 2003 and the Asia Pacific plastic operations that were divested in the second quarter of 2004. In addition, sales of containers for prescription packaging were adversely affected due to a milder flu season in December 2004 compared to December 2003. Increased resin prices passed through to customers and stronger currencies in Europe, Brazil and the Asia Pacific region partially offset these reductions. The change in net sales for the Plastics Packaging segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 2003 Net sales Plastics Packaging segment $ 792.7 Divested businesses $ (95.7 ) Effects of higher resin cost pass throughs 24.1 The effects of changing foreign currency rates on net sales 21.0 The effects of sales volume, price and mix 9.7 Other 10.5 Total net effect on sales (30.4 ) 2004 Net sales Plastics Packaging segment $ 762.3 Segment Operating Profit The Companys Segment Operating Profit results (dollars in millions) for 2004 and 2003 are presented in the following table. The Plastics Packaging Segment Operating Profit amounts reflect the continuing operations, and therefore, the results of the discontinued operations have been reclassified from the 2004 and 2003 amounts. In addition, certain Glass Container amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2004 2003 (dollars in millions) Glass Containers $ 759.6 $ 658.8 Plastics Packaging 115.0 98.7 Eliminations and other retained items (102.2 ) (91.9 ) 39 Segment Operating Profit of the Glass Containers segment for 2004 increased $100.8 million, or 15.3%, to $759.6 million, compared with Segment Operating Profit of $658.8 million for 2003. In Europe, Segment Operating Profit for 2004 increased $60.4 million over 2003. The newly acquired BSN business contributed $27.6 million of the increase. Stronger currency rates against the U.S. dollar for the European currencies also contributed to the growth in Segment Operating Profit. In addition, higher unit shipments over 2003 in combination with improved pricing and improved productivity also contributed to the growth. These increases were partially offset by higher energy costs. The Segment Operating Profit contribution from BSN for 2004 includes a reduction in gross profit of $31.1 million related to the impact of the acquisition step up of BSN finished goods inventory as required by FAS No. 141. In North America, Segment Operating Profit for 2004 increased $5.7 million over 2003. The benefits of higher selling prices and a more favorable product sales mix were the principal reasons for the increase. These increases were partially offset by a number of unfavorable effects, including: (1) lower production to control inventories consistent with the Companys working capital goals; (2) increased freight expense reflecting higher diesel fuel costs; and (3) a reduction in pension income. Also contributing to this decline was a 2% decline in unit shipments that was the result of the previously disclosed loss of a beverage customer. This decline in shipments of beverage containers was partially offset by increased shipments of containers for beer, wine, and liquor. In the Asia Pacific region, Segment Operating Profit for 2004 increased $11.8 million over 2003. The effects of overall improved pricing as well as increased unit shipments were partially offset by higher energy costs. The increased unit shipments primarily relate to higher shipments in Australia for containers for wine and beer and increased shipments in New Zealand. In South America, Segment Operating Profit for 2004 increased $22.9 million over 2003. The increase is primarily attributed to increased unit shipments during the year. Unit shipments were higher in Venezuela where shipments increased 30% over prior year and in Ecuador where shipments increased 34% over prior year. In addition to higher unit shipments, the increase is also attributed to a better product sales mix in Brazil as the sales mix moved away from lower margin exports. The change in Segment Operating Profit for the Glass Containers segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 2003 Segment Operating Profit Glass Containers $ 658.8 The effects of sales volume, price and mix $ 107.3 Additional Segment Operating Profit from BSN businesses 27.6 The effect of changing foreign currency rates on Segment Operating Profit 27.0 Improved productivity and other manufacturing costs 3.7 Lower pension income (25.2 ) Higher energy costs (22.8 ) Increased warehouse and other manufacturing costs (18.8 ) Other 2.0 Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit 100.8 2004 Segment Operating Profit Glass Containers $ 759.6 40 Segment Operating Profit of the Plastics Packaging segment for 2004 increased $16.3 million, or 16.5%, to $115.0 million compared to Segment Operating Profit of $98.7 million for 2003. The increase is primarily attributable to improved productivity and higher unit shipments. Also contributing to this increase was the non recurrence of the third quarter of 2003 write off of miscellaneous assets that were no longer being utilized. These increases were partially offset by higher delivery, warehouse, shipping and other manufacturing costs, as well as lower pension income. The change in Segment Operating Profit for the Plastics Packaging segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 2003 Segment Operating Profit Plastics Packaging $ 98.7 The effects of price,mix, sales volume and production volume $ 7.4 The effect of improved productivity 7.0 The non recurrence of a write off of miscellaneous assets 4.0 Increased delivery, warehouse, shipping and other manufacturing costs (3.6 ) Lower pension income (0.7 ) Other 2.2 Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit 16.3 2004 Segment Operating Profit Plastics Packaging $ 115.0 Eliminations and other retained items for 2004 were $10.3 million higher than for 2003. A reduction in pension income, higher legal and professional services costs in 2004 resulting in part from compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and higher retention of property and casualty losses were the primary reasons for the increase. These increases were partially offset by lower spending on information systems costs as compared to prior year. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $474.9 million in 2004 from $429.8 million in 2003. Interest expense for 2004 included charges of $28.0 million for note repurchase premiums and $2.8 million for the write off of unamortized finance fees related to debt that was repaid prior to its maturity. Interest expense for 2003 included charges of $13.2 million for note repurchase premiums and related write off of unamortized finance fees and $1.3 million for the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the reduction of available credit under the Companys previous bank credit agreement. Exclusive of these items in both years, interest expense for 2004 was $28.8 million higher than in 2003. The higher interest in 2004 reflects additional interest as a result of higher debt related to the BSN acquisition. Partially offsetting this increase were lower interest expense that was principally the result of savings from the December 2003 repricing of the Secured Credit Agreement and approximately $21 million in interest savings as a result of the Companys fixed to floating interest rate swap on a portion of its fixed rate debt. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2004 was 2.8%. Excluding the effects of items excluded from Segment Operating Profit discussed above, the additional interest charges for 41 early retirement of debt and a tax benefit on an Australian tax consolidation, the Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2004 was 26.9%. The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2003 was 30.5%. Excluding the effects of items excluded from Segment Operating Profit discussed above and the additional interest charges for early retirement of debt, the Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2003 was 27.9%. The lower effective tax rate in 2004 is principally due to a favorable change in the global mix of earnings. Minority Share Owners Interest in Earnings of Subsidiaries Minority share owners interest in earnings of subsidiaries for 2004 was $32.9 million compared to $25.8 million for 2003. The increase in 2004 is primarily due to higher earnings for the Companys subsidiaries in Venezuela, Colombia, and Italy. Earnings from Continuing Operations For 2004, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations of $171.5 million compared to a loss from continuing operations of $330.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The aftertax effects of the items excluded from Segment Operating Profit, the additional interest charges discussed above and the tax benefit on the Australian tax consolidation, increased or decreased earnings in 2004 and 2003 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2004 2003 Gain on the sale of certain real property $ 14.5 $ Gain on a restructuring in the Italian Specialty Glass business 13.1 Gain from the mark to market effect of certain commodity futures contracts 3.2 A benefit for a tax consolidation in the Australian glass business 33.1 Increase in the reserve for future asbestos related costs (84.9 ) (292.5 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees (20.1 ) (9.1 ) Life insurance restructuring charge (5.4 ) Write down of equity investment (50.0 ) Write down of Plastics Packaging assets in the Asia Pacific region (30.1 ) Loss on the sale of long term notes receivable (37.4 ) Loss on the sale of certain closures assets (25.8 ) Shutdown of the Milton, Ontario glass container factory (19.5 ) Shutdown of the Hayward, California glass container factory (17.8 ) Shutdown of the Perth, Australia glass container factory (17.4 ) Total $ (46.5 ) $ (499.6 ) Acquisition of BSN Glasspack, S.A. On June 21, 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of BSN Glasspack, S.A. (BSN) from Glasspack Participations (the BSN Acquisition). Total consideration for the BSN Acquisition was approximately $1.3 billion, including the assumption of approximately $650 million of debt, a portion of which was refinanced in connection with the BSN Acquisition. BSN was the second largest glass container manufacturer in Europe with manufacturing facilities in France, Spain, Germany and the 42 Netherlands. The BSN Acquisition was financed with borrowings under the Companys Second Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement. In order to secure the European Commissions approval, the Company committed to divest the Barcelona, Spain, and Corsico, Italy glass plants. The Company completed the sale of these plants in January 2005 and received cash proceeds of approximately 138.2 million. The BSN Acquisition was part of the Companys overall strategy to improve its presence in the European market in order to better serve the needs of its customers throughout the European region and to take advantage of synergies including purchasing leverage and cost reductions. This integration strategy should lead to significant improvement in earnings from the European operations by the end of 2006. During the second quarter of 2005, the Company concluded its evaluation of acquired capacity and announced the permanent closing of its Dsseldorf, Germany glass container factory, and the shutdown of a furnace at its Reims, France glass container facility, both in 2005. These actions were part of the previously announced European integration strategy to optimally align the manufacturing capacities with the market and improve operational efficiencies. As a result, the Company recorded an accrual of 47.1 million through an adjustment to goodwill. These second quarter actions will result in the elimination of approximately 400 jobs and a corresponding reduction in the Companys workforce. The Company expects to reduce fixed cash costs by approximately 35 million per year by closing the Dsseldorf factory, shutting down the furnace at Reims and moving most of the production to other locations. The Company anticipates that it will pay out approximately 110.9 million in cash related to severance, benefits, plant clean up, and other plant closing costs related to restructuring accruals. In addition, the Company expects to pay approximately 65 million for other European reorganization and integration activities, approximately 60% of which will be expensed. Approximately 50% of these payments were made by the end of 2005 and the Company expects that most of the balance will be paid in 2006. The restructuring accrual recorded in the second quarter of 2005 was in addition to the initial estimated accrual of 63.8 recorded in 2004. Selected information related to the restructuring accrual is as follows, with activity translated from Euros into dollars at the December 31, 2005 exchange rate (dollars in millions): Total restructuring accrual (110.9 million) $ 134.1 Net cash paid, principally severance and related benefits (41.0 ) Other, principally translation (12.2 ) Remaining European restructuring accrual as of December 31, 2005 $ 80.9 The total purchase cost of approximately $1.3 billion was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based upon their respective fair values. The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on June 21, 2004, translated from Euros into dollars at the exchange rate on that date (dollars in millions): 43 June 21, 2004 Inventories $ 294.3 Accounts receivable 197.7 Other current assets (excluding cash acquired) 31.8 Total current assets 523.8 Goodwill 716.6 Other long term assets 85.4 Net property, plant and equipment 762.1 Assets acquired $ 2,087.9 Accounts payable and other current liabilities (425.4 ) Other long term liabilities (387.5 ) Aggregate purchase costs $ 1,275.0 The assets above include $48.1 million of intangible assets related to customer relationships, which will be amortized over the next 13 years. The liabilities above include $133.6 million (110.9 million) for the restructuring actions discussed above, the majority of which relates to employee termination costs and related fringe benefits. Discontinued Operations On October 7, 2004, the Company announced that it had completed the sale of its blow molded plastic container operations in North America, South America and Europe, to Graham Packaging Company. Cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion were used to repay term loans under the Companys bank credit facility, which was amended to permit the sale. The sale agreement included a post closing purchase price adjustment based on changes in certain working capital components and certain other assets and liabilities of the business. This adjustment was finalized in April 2005, and Graham was paid approximately $39 million. The adjustment did not impact results of operations. Included in the sale were 24 plastics manufacturing plants in the U.S., two in Mexico, three in Europe and two in South America, serving consumer products companies in the food, beverage, household, chemical and personal care industries. The blow molded plastic container operations were part of the consumer products business unit of the plastics packaging segment. As required by FAS No. 144, the Company has presented the results of operations for the blow molded plastic container business in the Consolidated Results of Operations for 2004 and 2003 as a discontinued operation. Interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations based on debt that was required to be repaid from the proceeds. The following summarizes the revenues and expenses of the discontinued operations as reported in the condensed consolidated results of operations for the period indicated: 44 Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 Revenues: Net sales $ 875.3 $ 1,083.4 Other revenue 7.7 9.0 883.0 1,092.4 Costs and expenses: Manufacturing, shipping and delivery 754.6 949.3 Research, development and engineering 16.0 20.2 Selling and administrative 23.7 33.8 Interest 45.1 60.8 Other 22.9 681.0 862.3 1,745.1 Earnings (loss) before items below 20.7 (652.7 ) Provision for income taxes 27.1 8.0 Gain on sale of discontinued operations 70.4 Net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations $ 64.0 $ (660.7 ) Other costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 included an impairment charge of $670.0 million to reduce the reported value of goodwill in the consumer products reporting unit, all of which was attributable to the discontinued operations. The sale of the blow molded plastic business resulted in a substantial capital loss, primarily related to previous goodwill write downs that were not deductible when recorded. The 2004 gain on the sale of discontinued operations of $70.4 million includes a credit for income taxes of $39.7 million, representing the tax benefit from offsetting a portion of the loss against otherwise taxable capital gains. Discontinued operations of $63.0 million for 2005 includes $61.8 million for a benefit from the reversal of an accrual for potential tax liabilities related to a previous divestiture. The accrual is no longer required based on the Companys reassessment of the potential liabilities due to several factors, including statute expiration in September 2005. The balance of $1.2 million relates to an adjustment of the 2004 gain on the sale of the blow molded plastic container operations principally from finalizing certain tax allocations. Asbestos Related Costs The fourth quarter 2005 charge for asbestos related costs was $135.0 million ($86.0 million after tax), compared to the fourth quarter 2004 charge of $152.6 million ($84.9 million after tax). These charges resulted from the Companys comprehensive annual review of asbestos related liabilities and costs. In each case, the Company concluded that an increase in the accrued liability was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims pending and expected to be filed during the several years following the completion of the comprehensive review. See Critical Accounting Estimates for further information. Asbestos related cash payments for 2005 were $171.1 million, a reduction of $19.0 million, or 10.0%, from 2004. During 2005, the Company disposed of approximately 12,000 claims. Certain dispositions in 2005 and prior years have included deferred amounts payable over periods ranging up to seven years. 45 Deferred amounts payable at December 31, 2005 were approximately $91 million virtually unchanged from the amount at December 31, 2004. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet all asbestos related obligations on a short term and long term basis. As of December 31, 2005, the number of asbestos related claims pending against the Company was approximately 32,000, down from approximately 35,000 pending claims at December 31, 2004. A former business unit of the Company produced specialized high temperature insulation material containing asbestos from 1948 until 1958, when the business was sold. In line with its limited involvement with an asbestos containing product and its exit from that business over 45 years ago, the Company will continue to work aggressively to minimize the number of incoming cases and will continue to limit payments to only those impaired claimants who were exposed to the Companys products and whose claims have merit under applicable state law. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 2005 Non operational Items Impairment of Goodwill During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company completed its annual impairment testing using business enterprise values and determined that impairment existed in the goodwill of its Asia Pacific Glass business unit. Lower projected cash flows as a result of competitive pricing pressures in the Companys Australian glass operations caused the decline in the business enterprise value. Following a review of the valuation of the units identifiable assets, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $494.0 million to reduce the reported value of its goodwill. Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance The Company recorded a non cash charge of $306.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 to increase the valuation allowance against its accumulated net deferred tax assets in the United States. The Company had recorded net deferred tax assets related principally to asbestos charges and net operating losses in recent years. The amount of valuation allowance required under the provisions of FAS No. 109 is dependent upon projected near term U.S. profitability including the effects of tax planning. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company determined that an additional valuation allowance was necessary because of the near term effects on U.S. profitability of continued asbestos related payments, significant interest expense, rising energy costs and other cost increases. 2004 Non operational Items Plastics Packaging Assets In August of 2003, the Company initiated a review of its Plastics Packaging assets in the Asia Pacific region. The review was completed during the fourth quarter of 2003. The Company used a combination of estimated divestment cash flows, which included bid prices from potential purchasers, and partial liquidation values for certain assets to determine the net realizable values of the assets. The Company compared the estimated net realizable values to the book values of the assets and determined that asset impairment existed. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $43.0 million ($30.1 million after tax) to write down the assets to realizable values. Certain of the plastics businesses in the Asia Pacific region operate in highly competitive markets leading to reduced profit margins. In addition, the Companys PET container business has lost a significant amount of business in the past few years. The reduced business and overall excess capacity in the industry has caused a reduction in the overall value of the business. 46 During 2004, the Company completed the sale of a portion of this business and is continuing to evaluate prospective buyers for the remaining businesses. The Company does not expect to record any further material losses related to this business. Capital Resources and Liquidity Current and Long Term Debt The Companys total debt at December 31, 2005 was $5.30 billion, compared to $5.36 billion at December 31, 2004. On October 7, 2004, in connection with the sale of the Companys blow molded plastic container operations, the Companys subsidiary borrowers entered into the Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement (the Agreement). The proceeds from the sale were used to repay C and D term loans and a portion of the B1 term loan outstanding under the previous credit agreement. On January 19, 2005, the Company completed the required divestiture of two European glass container factories and received proceeds of approximately $180 million. The proceeds were largely used to repay debt during the first quarter. At December 31, 2005, the Agreement included a $600.0 million revolving credit facility and a $223.9 million A1 term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of April 1, 2007. It also included a $220.8 million B1 term loan, a $185.6 million C1 term loan, and a 46.3 million C2 term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of April 1, 2008. The Agreement also permits the Company, at its option, to refinance certain of its outstanding notes and debentures prior to their scheduled maturity. At December 31, 2005, the Companys subsidiary borrowers had unused credit of $511.0 million available under the Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Agreement at December 31, 2005 was 5.96%. Including the effects of cross currency swap agreements related to borrowings under the Agreement by the Companys Australian subsidiary, as discussed in Note 9, the weighted average interest rate was 6.76%. The Agreement contains covenants and provisions that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets, incur additional indebtedness, prepay other indebtedness or amend certain debt instruments, pay dividends, create liens on assets, enter into contingent obligations, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, make investments, loans or advances, make acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations, change the business conducted, or engage in certain transactions with affiliates and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities. In addition, the Agreement contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and meet specified tests based upon financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, maximum leverage ratios and specified capital expenditure tests. During December 2004, a subsidiary of the Company issued Senior Notes totaling $400.0 million and Senior Notes totaling 225.0 million. The notes bear interest at 6.75%, and are due December 1, 2014. Both series of notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries. The indentures for both series of notes have substantially the same restrictions as the previously issued 7.75%, 8.875% and 8.75% Senior Secured Notes and 8.25% Senior Notes. The issuing subsidiary used the net proceeds from the notes of approximately $680.0 million in addition to borrowings under the Agreement to purchase in a tender offer $237.6 million of the $350.0 million 7.15% Senior Notes due 2005, 159.6 47 million of the 160.0 million 9.25% BSN notes due 2009 and 127.3 million of the 140.0 million 10.25% BSN notes due 2009. As part of the issuance of these notes and the related tender offer, the Company recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 additional interest charges of $28.3 million for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees. The Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes that were issued during the past four years were part of the Companys plan to improve financial flexibility by issuing long term fixed rate debt, as well as refinance existing fixed rate debt that was nearing maturity. While this strategy extended the maturity of the Companys debt, long term fixed rate debt increases the cost of borrowing compared to shorter term, variable rate debt. The Company does not intend to continue to refinance variable rate debt with new fixed rate issuances, but will continue to issue long term fixed rate debt in order to repay existing fixed rate debt that is nearing maturity. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company expanded the capacity of its European accounts receivable securitization program from 200 million to 320 million to include operations in Italy and the United Kingdom. The accounts receivable securitization program provides lower costs of financing than traditional bank debt. The terms of this expansion resulted in a changing from off balance sheet to on balance sheet accounting for the program. The net impact was an increase, at December 31, 2005, in reported accounts receivable and consolidated debt of $191.8 million. Cash Flows For 2005, cash provided by continuing operating activities was $503.8 million compared with $544.7 million for 2004. The working capital reduction in 2004 occurred largely in BSN operations following its acquisition in June 2004 when inventories were at seasonally high levels. Higher payments of accrued liabilities and accounts payable, including approximately $41.0 million for European restructuring activities, also required more cash in 2005 than in 2004. In addition, cash flows in 2004 benefited from the initial effects of the Companys program to improve working capital management. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company paid $450.9 million in cash interest compared with $548.8 million for 2004. The 2004 amount included $47.2 million for repurchase premiums. Exclusive of that amount, cash paid for interest decreased $50.7 million from 2004. The decrease in cash interest paid is primarily due to lower overall interest rates from the June 2005 repricing of the Agreement, lower rates on fixed rate debt, lower average debt balances and the effects of cross currency swaps in Australia. Asbestos related payments for 2005 decreased $19.0 million, or 10.0%, to $171.1 million, compared with $190.1 million for 2004. The Company expects that its total asbestos related payments in 2006 will be moderately lower than 2005. Based on the Companys expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the Companys expected operating cash flow, the Company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Companys liquidity on a short term or long term basis. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment from continuing operating activities was $404.1 million compared to $436.7 million in the prior year. The 2005 amount included spending in the acquired BSN operations for the full year compared to the 2004 amount which included only the period from June 21 through December 31, 2004. The Company continues to focus on reducing capital spending and improving its return on invested capital by improving capital efficiency. 48 Cash flows from financing activities included payments by foreign operations to settle swaps of borrowings denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency. In particular, during the second quarter of 2005 certain swaps that hedged U.S. dollar borrowings in Australia required payments at maturity of approximately $65 million. These payments offset the Australian dollar gains recorded over the 2 year duration of the swaps during which the Australian dollar strengthened significantly against the U.S. dollar. The Company anticipates that cash flow from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs, debt service and other obligations on a short term and long term basis. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following information summarizes the Companys significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2005 (dollars in millions). Payments due by period Contractual cash obligations: Total Less than one year 1 2 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long term debt $ 5,263.6 $ 251.7 $ 1,325.2 $ 1,254.8 $ 2,431.9 Capital lease obligations 7.1 0.3 2.1 2.1 2.6 Operating leases 226.3 73.3 89.1 40.9 23.0 Contractual purchase obligation 10.7 10.7 Interest 2,253.7 402.7 746.1 513.3 591.6 Pension benefit plan contributions 48.9 48.9 Postretirement benefit plan benefit payments 214.4 21.5 42.6 42.7 107.6 Total contractual cash obligations $ 8,024.7 $ 809.1 $ 2,205.1 $ 1,853.8 $ 3,156.7 Amount of commitment expiration per period Other commercial commitments: Total Less than one year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Standby letters of credit $ 89.0 $ 89.0 Guarantees 9.0 $ 9.0 Total commercial commitments $ 98.0 $ 89.0 $ $ $ 9.0 Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, including but not limited to those related to pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, goodwill, and deferred tax assets. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of 49 certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates. The impact and any associated risks related to estimates and assumptions are discussed within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where estimates and assumptions affect the Companys reported and expected financial results. The Company believes that accounting for pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, goodwill, and deferred tax assets involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Pension Benefit Plans The determination of pension obligations and the related pension expense or credits to operations involves significant estimates. The most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on assets used in calculating the pension charges or credits for the year. The Company uses discount rates based on yields of highly rated fixed income debt securities at the end of the year. At December 31, 2005, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 5.3%. The Company uses an expected long term rate of return on assets that is based on both past performance of the various plans assets and estimated future performance of the assets. Due to the nature of the plans assets and the volatility of debt and equity markets, results may vary significantly from year to year. For example, actual returns in the Companys two largest plans were negative in each of the years 2000 2002. The returns exceeded 20% in 2003, 18% in 2004 and 10% in 2005. The Company refers to average historical returns over longer periods (up to 10 years) in determining its expected rates of return because short term fluctuations in market values do not reflect the rates of return the Company expects to achieve based upon its long term investing strategy. For 2005, the Companys estimated weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension assets was 8.4% compared to 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company recorded pension expense from continuing operations totaling approximately $4.0 million and $8.7 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively, from its principal defined benefit pension plans. The reduction in net pension expense resulted from changes in the U.S. salary plan, partially offset by lower discount rates, lower return rates and higher amortization. Depending on currency translation rates, the Company expects to record approximately $30.0 million of pension expense for the full year of 2006, compared with expense of $4.0 million for 2005. Future effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance. For example, a one half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding the expected return on assets would result in a change of approximately $18 million in pretax pension expense for the full year 2006. In addition, changes in external factors, including the fair values of plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities, could result in possible future balance sheet recognition of additional minimum pension liabilities. If the Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) of any of the Companys principal pension plans in the U.S. and Australia exceeds the fair value of its assets at the next measurement date of December 31, 2006, the Company will be required to write off the related prepaid pension asset and record a liability equal to the excess of the ABO over the fair value of the asset of such plan at the next measurement date of December 31, 2006. The non cash charge would result in a decrease in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income component of share owners equity that would significantly reduce net worth. Amounts related to the Companys U.S. and Australian plans as of December 31, 2005 were as follows (millions of dollars): 50 U.S. Salary Plans U.S. Hourly Plans Australian Plans Total Fair value of assets $ 832.4 $ 1,730.4 $ 107.4 $ 2,670.2 Accumulated benefit obligations 766.2 1,441.2 79.3 2,286.7 Excess $ 66.2 $ 289.2 $ 28.1 $ 383.5 Prepaid pension asset $ 327.2 $ 643.8 $ 17.1 $ 988.1 The Company is unable to predict discount rates or asset values at the next measurement date of December 31, 2006. However, if asset values and discount rates decline from their December 31, 2005 levels, the ABO of the U.S. salary plan may exceed the plans assets at the measurement date. In that event, the plans prepaid asset would be written off resulting in a pre tax charge to other comprehensive income in the range of $330 million to $340 million. Even if the fair values of the U.S. plans assets are less than ABO at December 31, 2006, the Company believes it will not be required to make cash contributions to the U.S. plans for at least several years. The covenants under the Companys Third Amended and Restated Secured Credit Agreement would not be affected by a reduction in the Companys net worth if a significant non cash charge was taken to write off the prepaid pension assets. Contingencies and Litigation The Company believes that its ultimate asbestos related liability (i.e., its indemnity payments or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees) cannot be estimated with certainty. The Companys ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the United States, the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation, the continued use of litigation screenings to generate new lawsuits, the large number of claims asserted or filed by parties who claim prior exposure to asbestos materials but have no present physical impairment as a result of such exposure, and the growing number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy. The Company believes that the bankruptcies of additional co defendants have resulted in an acceleration of the presentation and disposition of a number of claims, which would otherwise have been presented and disposed of over the next several years. The Company continues to monitor trends which may affect its ultimate liability and continues to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the Company. The Company conducts a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs annually in connection with finalizing and reporting its annual results of operations, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review. If the results of an annual comprehensive review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is insufficient to cover its estimated future asbestos related costs, then the Company will record an appropriate charge to increase the accrued liability. The Company believes that an estimation of the reasonably probable amount of the contingent liability for claims not yet asserted against the Company is not possible beyond a period of several years. Therefore, while the results of future annual comprehensive reviews cannot be determined, the Company expects the addition of one year to the estimation period will result in an annual charge. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a charge of $135.0 million ($86.0 million after tax) to increase its accrued liability for asbestos related costs. This amount was reduced from the 2004 charge of $152.6 million. The factors and developments that particularly affected the determination of this increase in the accrual included the following: (i) the 10% decline in yearly cash outlays; (ii) the slight decline in serious disease filings against the Company and the significant decline in the non malignancy 51 filings; (iii) the Companys successful litigation record during the year; and (iv) legislative developments in several states. The Companys estimates are based on a number of factors as described further in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill As required by FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangibles, the Company evaluates goodwill annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. The Company conducts its evaluation as of October 1 of each year. Goodwill impairment testing is performed using the business enterprise value (BEV) of each reporting unit which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free, after tax projected future cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer. This BEV is then compared to the book value of each reporting unit as of the measurement date to assess whether an impairment of goodwill may exist. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company completed its annual testing and determined that impairment existed in the goodwill of its Asia Pacific Glass business unit. Following a review of the units identifiable assets, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $494.0 million to reduce the reported value of its goodwill. If the Companys projected future cash flows were substantially lower, or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital were substantially higher, the testing performed as of October 1, 2005, may have indicated an impairment of one or more of the Companys other reporting units and, as a result, the related goodwill would also have been impaired. However, based on the Companys testing as of that date, modest changes in the projected future cash flows or cost of capital would not have created impairment in any other reporting unit. The Company will monitor conditions throughout 2006 that might significantly affect the projections and variables used in the impairment test to determine if a review prior to October 1 may be appropriate. If the results of impairment testing confirm that a write down of goodwill is necessary, then the Company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of 2006, or earlier if appropriate. In the event the Company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill, the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth. Deferred Tax Assets FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is largely dependent upon projected near term profitability including the effects of tax planning. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which the Company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses. In the United States, the Company has recorded significant deferred tax assets, the largest of which relate to net operating losses, capital losses, tax credits and the accrued liability for asbestos related costs that are not deductible until paid. The deferred tax assets are partially offset by deferred tax liabilities, the most significant of which relate to the prepaid pension asset and accelerated depreciation. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of U.S. deferred tax assets not offset by deferred tax liabilities. Should the Company be required to write off the prepaid pension assets related to the U.S. pension plans (as described above under Pension Benefit Plans), the related deferred tax liability would also be written off, leaving deferred tax assets amounting to approximately $262 million without a valuation allowance. 52 It is currently likely that an additional valuation allowance would be required in that case since it is currently more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would not be realized. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates, and changes in commodity prices, principally energy. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating energy prices. In addition, the Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of fixed and floating rate debt and to reduce interest expense. These instruments carry varying degrees of counterparty credit risk. To mitigate this risk, the Company has established limits on the exposure with individual counterparties and the Company regularly monitors these exposures. Substantially all of these exposures are with counterparties that are rated single A or above. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Earnings of operations outside the United States A substantial portion of the Companys operations are conducted by subsidiaries outside the U.S. The primary international markets served by the Companys subsidiaries are in Canada, Australia, South America (principally Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela), and Europe (principally Italy, France, the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Poland). In general, revenues earned and costs incurred by the Companys major international operations are denominated in their respective local currencies. Consequently, the Companys reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the international markets in which the Companys subsidiaries operate. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the reported dollar value of local currency earnings generally decreases; when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the reported U.S. dollar value of local currency earnings generally increases. The Company does not have any significant foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in the U.S. dollar, however, if economic conditions in Venezuela continue to decline, the Company may be required to adopt the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for its subsidiaries in that country. The Company does not hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to earnings of operations outside the United States. Borrowings not denominated in the functional currency Because the Companys subsidiaries operate within their local economic environment, the Company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with borrowings denominated in the local currency to the extent practicable where debt financing is desirable or necessary. Considerations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans, tax implications, and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms. In those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency, this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. In those countries where the U.S. dollar is the designated functional currency, however, local currency borrowings expose the Company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. Available excess funds of a subsidiary may be redeployed through intercompany loans to other subsidiaries for debt repayment, capital investment, or other cash requirements. Generally, each 53 intercompany loan is denominated in the lenders local currency giving rise to foreign currency exchange rate risk for the borrower. To mitigate this risk, the borrower generally enters into a forward exchange contract which effectively swaps the intercompany loan and related interest to its local currency. Similarly, certain of the Companys international subsidiaries have external borrowings denominated in currencies other than the designated functional currency, giving rise to foreign currency exchange rate risk for the borrower. To mitigate this risk, certain subsidiaries have entered into currency swaps or forward exchange contracts for the principal amount of their borrowings and, in some cases, the related interest. Significant transactions related to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from borrowings not denominated in the functional currency are as follows: At the end of 2005, the Companys subsidiary in Australia had an agreement that swaps a total of U.S. $175.0 million of borrowings into 251.8 million Australian dollars. This derivative instrument swaps the principal from U.S. dollars to Australian dollars and also swaps the interest rate from a U.S. based rate to an Australian based rate. This agreement has a maturity date of March 2006. In connection with debt refinancing in late December 2004, the Companys subsidiary in France borrowed approximately 91 million from Owens Brockway Glass Container (OBGC), a U.S. subsidiary of the Company, at a fixed interest rate through 2009. In order to hedge the changes in the cash flows of the foreign currency interest and principal repayments, OBGC entered into a swap that converts the Euro coupon interest payments into a predetermined U.S. dollar coupon interest payment and also converts the final principal payment in December 2009 from 91.0 million to approximately $120.7 million U.S. dollars. The Companys subsidiaries in Australia, Canada and several European countries have also entered into short term forward exchange contracts which effectively swap additional intercompany and external borrowings by each subsidiary into its local currency. These contracts swap the principal amount of borrowings and in some cases they swap the related interest. Purchases and sales not denominated in the functional currency Through the use of forward exchange contracts, the Company fixes some or all of the future amount payable/receivable on significant purchases and sales denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary entering into the underlying transaction. These instruments typically have terms of one year or less. Significant transactions related to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from purchases and sales not denominated in the functional currency are as follows: The Company entered into a foreign currency exchange contract to swap 37.5 million into $47.3 million U.S. dollars related to anticipated 2006 western European fuel oil purchases, a portion of which is denominated in U.S. dollars. The swap mitigates foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to approximately 93% of the anticipated 2006 fuel oil purchases in western Europe. The Company believes the near term exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk of its foreign currency risk sensitive instruments was not material at December 31, 2005 and 2004. 54 Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates applicable to its U.S. dollar indebtedness. In the fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $1.25 billion that mature from 2007 through 2013. The swaps were executed in order to: (i) convert a portion of the senior notes and senior debentures fixed rate debt into floating rate debt; (ii) maintain a capital structure containing appropriate amounts of fixed and floating rate debt; and (iii) reduce net interest payments and expense in the near term. Under the swaps, the Company receives fixed rate interest amounts (equal to interest on the corresponding hedged note) and pays interest at a six month U.S. LIBOR rate (set in arrears) plus a margin spread (see table below). The interest rate differential on each swap is recognized as an adjustment of interest expense during each six month period over the term of the agreement. The following table provides information about the Companys interest rate sensitivity related to its significant debt obligations and interest rate swaps at December 31, 2005. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contract maturity date. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the swap contracts.

The Company believes it can mitigate a portion of this risk by passing commodity cost changes through to customers. In addition, the Company enters into commodity futures contracts related to forecasted natural gas and fuel oil requirements, the objectives of which are to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid for natural gas and fuel oil and the related volatility in cash flows. The Company continually evaluates the natural gas and fuel oil market with respect to its forecasted usage requirements over the next twelve to eighteen months and periodically enters into commodity futures contracts in order to hedge a portion of its usage requirements over that period. Significant transactions related to commodity price risk are as follows: At December 31, 2005, the Company had entered into commodity futures contracts for approximately 62% (approximately 14,780,000 MM BTUs) of its expected North American natural gas usage for full year of 2006 and approximately 15% (approximately 3,600,000 MM BTUs) for the full year of 2007. At December 31, 2005, the Company had also entered into commodity futures contracts for substantially all of its expected western European fuel oil usage (approximately 43,500 metric tons) for the first quarter of 2006. The Company believes the near term exposure to commodity price risk of its commodity futures contracts was not material at December 31, 2005 and 2004.
