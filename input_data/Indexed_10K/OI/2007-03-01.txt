ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview Years ended December 2006 and 2005 Net sales of the Glass Containers segment were $383.5 million higher than the prior year principally resulting from increased unit shipments, improved pricing, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment were $40.5 million lower than the prior year. Excluding the absence of $46.3 million in sales from a portion of the plastics business in the Asia Pacific region which was divested in December of 2005, sales increased over the prior year. Resin cost pass throughs more than offset an unfavorable product mix. Segment Operating Profit of the Glass Containers segment was $39.5 million lower than the prior year. The benefits of higher selling prices, improved productivity, fixed cost savings and increased unit shipments were more than offset by inflationary cost increases. Segment Operating Profit of the Plastics Packaging segment for 2006 was $12.7 million lower than the prior year. The decrease resulted principally from the exit from the Asia Pacific plastics business and inflationary cost increases, partially offset by improved productivity and cost savings. Interest expense for 2006 was $488.2 million compared to $466.7 million in 2005. Included in the 2006 interest expense was $17.5 million for note repurchase premiums and the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the June 2006 refinancing of the Companys previous credit agreement and the July 2006 repurchase of approximately $150 million principal amount of the 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2009. Net loss in 2006 was $27.5 million, or $0.32 per share (diluted), compared to a loss from continuing operations of $621.6 million, or $4.26 per share (diluted) in 2005. Earnings in both periods included items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased net earnings in 2006 by $177.0 million, or $1.15 per share, and decreased net earnings in 2005 by $850.9 million, or $5.62 per share. Cash payments for asbestos related costs were $162.5 million for 2006 compared to $171.1 million for 2005. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment was $320.3 million compared to $404.1 million in the prior year. 28 Results of Operations Comparison of 2006 with 2005 Net Sales The Companys net sales by segment for 2006 and 2005 are presented in the following table. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Glass Containers $ 6,650.4 $ 6,266.9 Plastics Packaging 771.6 812.1 Segment and consolidated net sales $ 7,422.0 $ 7,079.0 Consolidated net sales for 2006 increased $343.0 million, or 4.8%, to $7,422.0 million from $7,079.0 million in 2005. Net sales of the Glass Containers segment increased $383.5 million, or 6.1%, over 2005. Shipments of beer containers and beverage containers increased in 2006 compared to 2005, more than offsetting reductions in most other product lines. Also contributing to the increase were generally higher selling prices. The change in net sales for the Glass Containers segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Net sales 2005 $ 6,266.9 Net effect of price and mix $ 233.8 Net effect of volume 79.5 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 86.5 Other (16.3 ) Total net effect on sales 383.5 Net sales 2006 $ 6,650.4 Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment decreased $40.5 million from 2005. Excluding the absence of $46.3 million in sales from a portion of the plastics business in the Asia Pacific region which was divested in December of 2005, sales increased over the prior year. Resin cost pass throughs more than offset an unfavorable product mix. 29 The change in net sales for the Plastics Packaging segment can be summarized as follows: Net sales 2005 $ 812.1 Effect of increased resin cost pass throughs $ 17.9 Divestiture (46.3 ) Net effect of price and mix (11.2 ) Net effect of volume (0.2 ) Effects of changing foreign currency rates (0.7 ) Total net effect on sales (40.5 ) Net sales 2006 $ 771.6 Segment Operating Profit Operating Profit for product segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. For the Companys U.S. pension plans, net periodic pension cost has been allocated to product segments. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Glass Containers $ 751.3 $ 790.8 Plastics Packaging 114.5 127.2 Eliminations and other retained items (91.2 ) (89.4 ) Segment Operating Profit of the Glass Containers segment for 2006 decreased $39.5 million, or 5.0%, to $751.3 million, compared with Segment Operating Profit of $790.8 million in 2005. The change in Segment Operating Profit for the Glass Containers segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Segment Operating Profit 2005 $ 790.8 Net effect of price, mix and unit sales volumes $ 270.1 Productivity, European capacity reduction and cost savings 116.4 Inflation, operating expenses, warehouse and delivery, and European integration (369.4 ) Other business impacts including pension expense, and currency translation (38.5 ) Other (18.1 ) Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit (39.5 ) Segment Operating Profit 2006 $ 751.3 Segment Operating Profit of the Plastics Packaging segment for 2006 was $114.5 million compared with Segment Operating Profit of $127.2 million in 2005. 30 The change in Segment Operating Profit for the Plastics Packaging segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Segment Operating Profit 2005 $ 127.2 Productivity and cost savings $ 14.3 Inflation, operating expenses, and warehouse and delivery (9.0 ) Divestiture (8.2 ) Other business impacts including pension expense, and currency translation (3.2 ) Net effect of price, mix and unit sales volumes (0.1 ) Other (6.5 ) Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit (12.7 ) Segment Operating Profit 2006 $ 114.5 Eliminations and other retained items for 2006 were $91.2 million compared to $89.4 million for 2005. Interest Expense Interest expense for 2006 was $488.2 million compared to $466.7 million in 2005. Included in the 2006 interest expense was $17.5 million for both note repurchase premiums and the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the June 2006 refinancing of the Companys previous credit agreement and the July 2006 repurchase of approximately $150 million principal amount of the 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2009. Also contributing to the increase were higher average debt balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys reported effective tax rate was 88.7% in 2006 and (167.9)% in 2005. Excluding the effects of separately taxed items in both periods, listed in the table below, the Companys effective tax rate for the full year 2006 was 40.3% compared with 29.9% for the full year 2005. The 2006 effective tax rate increased principally because the Company is no longer recording tax benefits on its losses in the United States. A shift in mix of earnings towards higher tax cost countries in other regions of the world also increased the effective tax rate for the year. Minority Share Owners Interest in Earnings of Subsidiaries Minority share owners interest in earnings of subsidiaries for 2006 was $43.6 million compared to $35.9 million for 2005. The increase is primarily attributed to higher earnings from the Companys operations in South America. Earnings from Continuing Operations For 2006, the Company recorded a net loss of $27.5 million compared to a loss from continuing operations of $621.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The after tax effects of the items excluded from Segment Operating Profit, the 2006 international net tax benefit, the tax charge to increase the U.S. valuation allowance, the tax benefit of reversing an accrual for potential tax liabilities, and the additional interest charges, increased or decreased earnings in 2006 and 2005 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). 31 Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2006 2005 Curtailment of postretirement benefits in The Netherlands $ 11.2 Gain on the sale of the Corsico, Italy glass container facility 28.1 A tax benefit from the reversal of an accrual for potential tax liabilities 5.3 Reversal of non U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance partially offset by charges related to international tax restructuring 5.7 Impairment of goodwill in the Asia Pacific Glass unit (494.0 ) Increase in the U.S. deferred tax valuation allowance (306.6 ) Increase in the accrual for future asbestos related costs (120.0 ) (86.0 ) Charge for closing the Godfrey, Illinois plant (27.7 ) CEO transition charge and other (20.7 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees (17.1 ) Gain (loss) from the mark to market effect of natural gas hedge contracts (8.4 ) 2.3 Total $ (177.0 ) $ (850.9 ) Executive Overview Years ended December 2005 and 2004 Net sales of the Glass Containers segment were $900.8 million higher than the prior year principally resulting from the BSN Acquisition and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment were $49.8 million higher than the prior year. Higher sales from improved pricing, increased sales volume and pass through of higher resin costs were partially offset by the absence of sales from plastic container assets in the Asia Pacific region that were divested in the second quarter of 2004. Segment Operating Profit of the Glass Containers segment was $31.2 million higher than the prior year. The BSN Acquisition accounted for most of the increase. The benefits of stronger foreign currencies and higher selling prices were partially offset by inflationary cost increases. Segment Operating Profit of the Plastics Products segment was $12.2 million higher than the prior year. Increases from improved pricing, sales volume, product mix and a gain from the sale of a plant related to the partial exit from the Australian plastics business more than offset increased costs. Interest expense was $8.2 million lower than the prior year. The decrease resulted from lower debt levels in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 and the non recurrence of repurchase premiums partially offset by higher variable interest rates and higher debt from the BSN Acquisition. Loss from continuing operations in 2005 was $621.6 million, or $4.26 per share (diluted), down from earnings of $171.5 million, or $1.00 per share (diluted), from continuing operations in 2004. Earnings in both periods included items that management considers not representative of continuing operations. These items decreased net earnings in 2005 by $850.9 million, or $5.62 per share, and decreased net earnings in 2004 by $46.5 million, or $0.31 per share. Cash payments for asbestos related costs were $171.1 million, down 10.0% from the prior year. 32 The Companys total debt at December 31, 2005 was $5.30 billion or $63.4 million lower than the prior year balance. Exclusive of the $191.8 million increase in both debt and accounts receivable required by a change in the Companys European accounts receivable securitization program, total debt decreased by $255.2 million to its lowest level since 1998. Results of Operations Comparison of 2005 with 2004 Net Sales The Companys net sales by segment for 2005 and 2004 are presented in the following table. The Plastics Packaging amounts for 2004 reflect only the continuing operations. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 21 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Glass Containers $ 6,266.9 $ 5,366.1 Plastics Packaging 812.1 762.3 Segment and consolidated net sales $ 7,079.0 $ 6,128.4 Consolidated net sales for 2005 increased $950.6 million, or 15.5%, to $7,079.0 million from $6,128.4 million in 2004. Net sales of the Glass Containers segment increased $900.8 million, or 16.8%, over 2004. Contributing to the increase were the additional sales from the BSN Acquisition. Increased shipments of beverage containers throughout the Americas more than offset reduced shipments of food containers in North America. Improved pricing also had a favorable effect on net sales. Favorable currency exchange rates accounted for about 5% of the increase. Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of sales from the Castellar factory sold in January 2005. The change in net sales for the Glass Containers segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Net sales 2004 $ 5,366.1 Net effect of the BSN Acquisition, volume, price, and mix $ 883.3 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 46.2 Divestiture of Castellar factory (28.7 ) Total net effect on sales 900.8 Net sales 2005 $ 6,266.9 Net sales of the Plastics Packaging segment increased $49.8 million, or 6.5%, from 2004. The higher sales reflected improved pricing and sales volume in several product lines, the pass through effect of higher resin costs, and favorable currency translation rates. Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of sales from plastic container assets in the Asia Pacific region that were divested in the second quarter of 2004. 33 The change in net sales for the Plastics Packaging segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Net sales 2004 $ 762.3 Effect of increased resin cost pass throughs $ 44.8 Net effect of volume, price and mix 34.4 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 3.5 Divestiture (32.9 ) Total net effect on sales 49.8 Net sales 2005 $ 812.1 Segment Operating Profit Operating Profit for product segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. For the Companys U.S. pension plans, net periodic pension cost (credit) has been allocated to product segments. The Plastics Packaging amounts for 2004 reflect only the continuing operations. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2005 2004 (dollars in millions) Glass Containers $ 790.8 $ 759.6 Plastics Packaging 127.2 115.0 Eliminations and other retained items (89.4 ) (102.2 ) Segment Operating Profit of the Glass Containers segment for 2005 increased $31.2 million, or 4.1%, to $790.8 million, compared with Segment Operating Profit of $759.6 million in 2004. Factors contributing to the increase were: (1) the additional operating profit from the BSN Acquisition; (2) increased unit shipments of beverage containers principally in the Americas; (3) favorable exchange rates; (4) generally improved selling prices; and (5) the non recurrence of the acquisition step up of BSN finished goods inventory. Factors that partially offset the increase were: (1) inflationary cost increases including energy, raw material costs, and transportation; (2) temporarily idled production capacity to reduce inventory; (3) costs of the European integration and new European headquarters; (4) the absence of equity earnings from Consol Limited (divested in the fourth quarter of 2004); (5) the absence of operating profit from the Corsico and Castellar factories; and (6) reduced food container shipments in North America. 34 The change in Segment Operating Profit for the Glass Containers segment can be summarized as follows: Segment Operating Profit 2004 $ 759.6 Net effect of BSN acquisition and volume, price, and mix $ 184.0 Non recurrence of BSN inventory step up 31.1 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 14.5 Higher energy costs (75.7 ) Other inflationary cost increases (57.7 ) Temporarily idled production capacity to reduce inventory (20.5 ) Effects of European integration and new European headquarter costs (18.0 ) Divestiture of Corsico and Castellar factories and Consol investment (13.6 ) Increased delivery and warehousing costs (4.7 ) Other (8.2 ) Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit 31.2 Segment Operating Profit 2005 $ 790.8 Segment Operating Profit of the Plastics Packaging segment for 2005 increased $12.2 million, or 10.6%, to $127.2 million compared with Segment Operating Profit of $115.0 million in 2004. The 2005 amount includes a $6 million fourth quarter gain from the sale of one plant related to the partial exit from the Australian plastics business and a reduction of the accrued exit costs. Also contributing to the increase were the effects of improved pricing, product mix, and sales volume which more than offset the effect of increases in manufacturing, shipping and delivery costs, and the absence of profits from the plastic container assets in the Asia Pacific region that were divested in the second quarter of 2004. The change in Segment Operating Profit for the Plastics Packaging segment can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Segment Operating Profit 2004 $ 115.0 Net effect of volume, price and mix $ 14.8 Partial exit of Australian plastics business 6.0 Non recurrence plant shut down costs 3.7 Divestiture (4.1 ) Increased delivery, warehousing and other inflationary cost increases (4.2 ) Higher energy costs (1.9 ) Other (2.1 ) Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit 12.2 Segment Operating Profit 2005 $ 127.2 Eliminations and other retained items for 2005 were favorable by $12.8 million compared to 2004. The 2005 year reflects a favorable adjustment of approximately $10.0 million to the Companys accruals for self insured risks, partially offset by higher retained costs for the divested blow molded plastic container business and adjustments made to certain accruals. The 2004 year included self insured property and casualty losses that did not recur in 2005. 35 Interest Expense Interest expense decreased to $466.7 million in 2005 from $474.9 million in 2004. The 2004 amount included $30.8 million for repurchase premiums and write offs of unamortized finance fees. Exclusive of that amount, interest expense increased $22.6 million in 2005 due to higher interest rates on the Companys variable rate debt and additional interest as a result of higher debt related to the BSN Acquisition. Partially offsetting this increase was lower interest as a result of lower average debt balances in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 and lower interest rates on fixed rate debt in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys reported effective tax rate was (167.9)% in 2005 and 2.8% in 2004. Excluding the effects of separately taxed items in both periods, listed in the table below, the Companys effective tax rate for 2005 was 29.9% compared with 26.9% in 2004. The higher 2005 effective rate is principally due to a change in the mix of earnings toward higher tax international jurisdictions, tax legislation enacted in Ohio and recognition of other discrete changes in deferred taxes during 2005. Minority Share Owners Interest in Earnings of Subsidiaries Minority share owners interest in earnings of subsidiaries for 2005 was $35.9 million compared to $32.9 million for 2004. Earnings from Continuing Operations For 2005, the Company recorded a loss from continuing operations of $621.6 million compared to earnings from continuing operations of $171.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The after tax effects of the items excluded from Segment Operating Profit, the tax charge to increase the valuation allowance, the tax benefit of reversing an accrual for potential tax liabilities, the additional interest charges and the tax benefit on the Australian tax consolidation, increased or decreased earnings in 2005 and 2004 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2005 2004 Gain on the sale of the Corsico, Italy glass container facility $ 28.1 $ A tax benefit from the reversal of an accrual for potential tax liabilities 5.3 Gain on the sale of certain real property 14.5 Gain on a restructuring in the Italian Specialty Glass business 13.1 Gain from the mark to market effect of natural gas hedge contracts 2.3 3.2 A benefit for a tax consolidation in the Australian glass business 33.1 Impairment of goodwill in the Asia Pacific Glass unit (494.0 ) Increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance (306.6 ) Increase in the reserve for future asbestos related costs (86.0 ) (84.9 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees (20.1 ) Life insurance restructuring charge (5.4 ) Total $ (850.9 ) $ (46.5 ) 36 Discontinued Operations On October 7, 2004, the Company announced that it had completed the sale of its blow molded plastic container operations in North America, South America and Europe, to Graham Packaging Company. Cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion were used to repay term loans under the Companys bank credit facility, which was amended to permit the sale. The sale agreement included a post closing purchase price adjustment based on changes in certain working capital components and certain other assets and liabilities of the business. This adjustment was finalized in April 2005, and Graham was paid approximately $39 million. The adjustment did not impact results of operations. Included in the sale were 24 plastics manufacturing plants in the U.S., two in Mexico, three in Europe and two in South America, serving consumer products companies in the food, beverage, household, chemical and personal care industries. The blow molded plastic container operations were part of the consumer products business unit of the plastics packaging segment. As required by FAS No. 144, the Company has presented the results of operations for the blow molded plastic container business in the Consolidated Results of Operations for 2004 as a discontinued operation. Interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations based on debt that was required to be repaid from the proceeds. The following summarizes the revenues and expenses of the discontinued operations as reported in the condensed consolidated results of operations for the period indicated: Year ended December 31, 2004 Revenues: Net sales $ 875.3 Other revenue 7.7 883.0 Costs and expenses: Manufacturing, shipping and delivery 754.6 Research, development and engineering 16.0 Selling and administrative 23.7 Interest 45.1 Other 22.9 862.3 Earnings before items below 20.7 Provision for income taxes 27.1 Gain on sale of discontinued operations 70.4 Net earnings from discontinued operations $ 64.0 The sale of the blow molded plastic business resulted in a substantial capital loss, primarily related to previous goodwill write downs that were not deductible when recorded. The 2004 gain on the sale of discontinued operations of $70.4 million includes a credit for income taxes of $39.7 million, representing the tax benefit from offsetting a portion of the loss against otherwise taxable capital gains. 37 Discontinued operations of $63.0 million for 2005 includes $61.8 million for a benefit from the reversal of an accrual for potential tax liabilities related to a previous divestiture. The accrual is no longer required based on the Companys reassessment of the potential liabilities due to several factors, including statute expiration in September 2005. The balance of $1.2 million relates to an adjustment of the 2004 gain on the sale of the blow molded plastic container operations principally from finalizing certain tax allocations. Asbestos Related Costs The fourth quarter 2006 charge for asbestos related costs was $120.0 million (pretax and after tax), compared to the fourth quarter 2005 charge of $135.0 million ($86.0 million after tax). These charges resulted from the Companys comprehensive annual review of asbestos related liabilities and costs. In each case, the Company concluded that an increase in the accrued liability was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims pending and expected to be filed during the several years following the completion of the comprehensive review. See Critical Accounting Estimates for further information. Asbestos related cash payments for 2006 were $162.5 million, a reduction of $8.6 million, or 5.0%, from 2005. During 2006, the Company disposed of approximately 21,000 claims. Certain dispositions in 2006 and prior years have included deferred amounts payable over periods ranging up to seven years. Deferred amounts payable at December 31, 2006 were approximately $82.6 million compared to approximately $91 million at December 31, 2005. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet all asbestos related obligations on a short term and long term basis. As of December 31, 2006, the number of asbestos related claims pending against the Company was approximately 18,000, down from approximately 32,000 pending claims at December 31, 2005. A former business unit of the Company produced specialized high temperature insulation material containing asbestos from 1948 until 1958, when the business was sold. In line with its limited involvement with an asbestos containing product and its exit from that business over 45 years ago, the Company will continue to work aggressively to minimize the number of incoming cases and will continue to limit payments to only those impaired claimants who were exposed to the Companys products and whose claims have merit under applicable state law. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 2006 Non operational Items Capacity Curtailment In September 2006, the Company announced the permanent closing of its Godfrey, Illinois machine parts manufacturing operation. The facility was closed by the end of the year. This closing is part of a broad initiative to reduce working capital and improve system costs. The Company also closed a small recycling facility in Ohio. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $29.7 million ($27.7 million after tax) in the third quarter of 2006. The closing of these facilities resulted in the elimination of approximately 260 jobs and a corresponding reduction in the Companys workforce. The Company anticipates that it will pay out approximately $11.5 million in cash related to insurance, benefits, plant clean up, and other plant closing costs. The Company expects that the majority of these costs will be paid out by the end of 2008. 38 CEO Transition and Other Separation Charges The Company recorded a fourth quarter charge of $20.8 million ($20.7 million after tax) associated with the separation agreement with its former CEO and with several members of the European management team. The charge also included costs related to the employment agreement with the Companys new CEO. Other Postretirement Benefits The Company recorded a fourth quarter gain of $15.9 million ($11.2 million after tax) related to curtailment of certain postretirement benefits in The Netherlands as a result of certain improvements in retiree medical benefits offered by the government. Tax Benefit In the fourth quarter, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $5.7 million from the reversal of a valuation allowance against certain non U.S. deferred tax assets due to improving operations, partially offset by charges related to international tax restructuring. 2005 Non operational Items Impairment of Goodwill During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company completed its annual impairment testing using business enterprise values and determined that impairment existed in the goodwill of its Asia Pacific Glass business unit. Lower projected cash flows as a result of competitive pricing pressures in the Companys Australian glass operations caused the decline in the business enterprise value. Following a review of the valuation of the units identifiable assets, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $494.0 million to reduce the reported value of its goodwill. Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance The Company recorded a non cash charge of $306.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 to increase the valuation allowance against its accumulated net deferred tax assets in the United States. The Company had recorded net deferred tax assets related principally to asbestos charges and net operating losses in recent years. The amount of valuation allowance required under the provisions of FAS No. 109 is dependent upon projected near term U.S. profitability including the effects of tax planning. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company determined that an additional valuation allowance was necessary because of the near term effects on U.S. profitability of continued asbestos related payments, significant interest expense, rising energy costs and other cost increases. As a result of the lower projected U.S. taxable income, the Company determined that certain tax planning strategies were no longer prudent and feasible and, therefore, were not likely to be implemented. 39 Capital Resources and Liquidity Current and Long Term Debt The Companys total debt at December 31, 2006 was $5.46 billion, compared to $5.30 billion at December 31, 2005. On June 14, 2006, the Companys subsidiary borrowers entered into the Secured Credit Agreement (the Agreement). Proceeds from the Agreement were used to repay all outstanding amounts under the previous credit agreement. At December 31, 2006, the Agreement included a $900.0 million revolving credit facility, a 292.5 million Australian dollar term loan, and a 134.6 million Canadian dollar term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of June 15, 2012. It also included a $195.5 million term loan and a 195.5 million term loan each of which have a final maturity date of June 14, 2013. The Agreement also permits the Company, at its option, to refinance certain of its outstanding notes and debentures prior to their scheduled maturity. The Company recorded $10.2 million of additional interest charges for the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the early repayment of the previous credit agreement. At December 31, 2006, the Companys subsidiary borrowers had unused credit of $765.6 million available under the Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Agreement at December 31, 2006 was 6.52%. The Agreement contains covenants and provisions that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets, incur additional indebtedness, prepay other indebtedness or amend certain debt instruments, pay dividends, create liens on assets, enter into contingent obligations, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, make investments, loans or advances, make acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations, change the business conducted, engage in certain transactions with affiliates and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities. In addition, the Agreement contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and meet specified tests based upon financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including minimum interest coverage ratios, maximum leverage ratios and specified capital expenditure tests. During July of 2006, a subsidiary of the Company used borrowings under the Agreement to repurchase $150.0 million principal amount of the 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2009. During the third quarter, the Company recorded $7.3 million of additional interest charges for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees. 40 During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company expanded the capacity of its European accounts receivable securitization program from 200 million to 320 million to include operations in Italy and the United Kingdom. The accounts receivable securitization program provides lower costs of financing than traditional bank debt. The terms of this expansion resulted in changing from off balance sheet to on balance sheet accounting for the program by consolidating both the accounts receivable in the program and the secured indebtedness of the same amount. During October of 2006, the Company entered into a new 300 million European accounts receivable securitization program. The new program replaces the previous European program, described in the preceding paragraph, which was set to terminate in October 2006. At December 31, 2006, the European program had a balance of $195.0 million, and the Asia Pacific program had a balance of $84.4 million recorded in short term loans. The interest rate on the accounts receivable securitization program is a local short term variable rate plus a margin over the variable rate of 0.70% for the European program and 0.85% for the Asia Pacific program. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the European program was 4.81% at December 31, 2006. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Asia Pacific program was 7.43% at December 31, 2006. These programs have maturity dates ranging from January of 2008 through October of 2011. Cash Flows For 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $150.3 million compared with $453.1 million for 2005. The 2006 and 2005 amounts exclude $127.3 million and $50.7 million, respectively, of collections on receivables arising from the consolidation of the receivables securitization program as described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Software acquisition and development costs and payments of approximately $33.7 million for European restructuring activities required more cash in 2006 than in 2005. Working capital also required more cash in 2006 than in 2005 due to increased production and sales activities, principally in the fourth quarter, and because the change in 2006 lacked the benefit of the reductions achieved in 2005 as part of Companys focus on working capital improvement. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company paid $461.0 million in cash interest compared with $450.9 million for 2005. The 2006 amount included $6.2 million for repurchase premiums. Asbestos related payments for 2006 decreased $8.6 million, or 5.0%, to $162.5 million, compared with $171.1 million for 2005. Based on the Companys expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the Companys expected operating cash flow, the Company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Companys liquidity on a short term or long term basis. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment was $320.3 million compared to $404.1 million in the prior year. The lower capital spending was principally due to the completion of the new glass container manufacturing facility in Windsor, CO. in the fourth quarter of 2005. In addition, the Company capitalized $25.3 million under capital lease obligations with the related financing recorded as long term debt. The Company continues to focus on reducing capital spending and improving its return on invested capital by improving capital efficiency. 41 The Company anticipates that cash flow from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs, debt service and other obligations on a short term and long term basis. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following information summarizes the Companys significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2006 (dollars in millions). Payments due by period Total Less than one year 1 2 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Contractual cash obligations: Long term debt $ 5,012.2 $ 323.0 $ 1,141.2 $ 923.3 $ 2,624.7 Capital lease obligations 31.6 1.4 2.9 2.6 24.7 Operating leases 146.0 49.2 61.6 26.9 8.3 Interest 2,128.9 406.7 710.3 512.6 499.3 Pension benefit plan contributions 55.3 55.3 Postretirement benefit plan benefit payments 230.3 24.5 47.6 46.4 111.8 Total contractual cash obligations $ 7,604.3 $ 860.1 $ 1,963.6 $ 1,511.8 $ 3,268.8 Amount of commitment expiration per period Total Less than one year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Other commercial commitments: Standby letters of credit $ 89.2 $ 89.2 Guarantees 9.0 $ 9.0 Total commercial commitments $ 98.2 $ 89.2 $ $ $ 9.0 Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the financial statements are issued. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates. The impact of and any associated risks related to estimates and assumptions are discussed within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where estimates and assumptions affect the Companys reported and expected financial results. 42 The Company believes that accounting for property, plant and equipment, impairment of long lived assets, pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, and income taxes involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Property, Plant and Equipment The net carrying amount of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) at December 31, 2006 totaled $3,193.7 million, representing 34% of total assets. Depreciation expense during 2006 totaled $469.0 million, representing over 6% of total costs and expenses. Given the significance of PP&E and associated depreciation to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the determinations of an assets cost basis and its economic useful life are considered to be critical accounting estimates. Cost Basis PP&E is recorded at cost, which is generally objectively quantifiable when assets are purchased singly. However, when assets are purchased in groups, or as part of a business, costs assigned to PP&E are based on an estimate of fair value of each asset at the date of acquisition. These estimates are based on assumptions about asset condition, remaining useful life and market conditions, among others. The Company frequently employs expert appraisers to aid in allocating cost to assets purchased as a group. Included in the cost basis of PP&E are those costs which substantially increase the useful lives or capacity of existing PP&E. Significant judgment is needed to determine which costs should be capitalized under these criteria and which costs should be expensed as a repair or maintenance expenditure. For example, the Company frequently incurs various costs related to its existing glass melting furnaces and molding machines and must make a determination of which costs, if any, to capitalize. The Company relies on the experience and expertise of its operations and engineering staff to make reasonable and consistent judgments regarding increases in useful lives or capacity of PP&E. Estimated Useful Life PP&E is generally depreciated using the straight line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings each period over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by the Company, which may be less than its physical life. Managements assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, product and process obsolescence, technical standards, and changes in market demand. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, technological advances, excessive wear and tear, or changes in customers requirements may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, the Company depreciates the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Over the past three years, changes in economic useful life assumptions have not had a material impact on the Companys reported results. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Property, Plant and Equipment As required by FAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the Company tests for impairment of PP&E whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. PP&E held for use in the Companys business is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which cash flows can reasonably be identified, typically a factory. The Company assesses recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be 43 generated by the assets. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset groups carrying amount exceeds its fair value. PP&E held for sale is reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Impairment testing requires estimation of the fair value of PP&E based on the discounted value of projected future cash flows generated by the asset group. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent managements best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include: industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. The Company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. There were no material charges for impairment of asset groups held for use in 2006, 2005, or 2004. As part of the actions taken to close its Godfrey, Illinois machine parts manufacturing operation, the Company recognized a charge for impairment of assets to be sold or abandoned of $3.8 million in 2006. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill Goodwill at December 31, 2006 totaled $2,464.7 million, representing 26% of total assets. As required by FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangibles, the Company evaluates goodwill annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. The Company conducts its evaluation as of October 1 of each year. Goodwill impairment testing is performed using the business enterprise value (BEV) of each reporting unit which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free, after tax projected future cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer. This BEV is then compared to the book value of each reporting unit as of the measurement date to assess whether an impairment of goodwill may exist. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company completed its annual testing and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. If the Companys projected future cash flows were substantially lower, or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital was substantially higher, the testing performed as of October 1, 2006, may have indicated an impairment of one or more of the Companys reporting units and, as a result, the related goodwill would also have been impaired. For example, if projected future cash flows had been decreased by 5%, or alternatively, if the weighted average cost of capital had been increased by 5%, the resulting lower BEVs would still have exceeded the book value of each reporting unit by a significant margin in all cases except for the Asia Pacific Glass reporting unit. Because the BEV for the Asia Pacific Glass reporting unit exceeded its book value by approximately 7%, the results of the impairment testing could be negatively affected by relatively modest changes in the assumptions and projections. At December 31, 2006, the goodwill of the Asia Pacific Glass reporting unit accounted for approximately $500 million of the Companys consolidated goodwill. The Company will monitor conditions throughout 2007 that might significantly affect the projections and variables used in the impairment test to determine if a review prior to October 1 may be appropriate. If the results of impairment testing confirm that a write down of goodwill is necessary, then the Company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of 2007, or earlier if appropriate. In the event the Company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill, the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth. Other Long Lived Assets Other long lived assets include, among others, equity investments and repair parts inventories. The Companys equity investments are non publicly traded ventures with other companies in businesses related to those of the Company. Equity investments are reviewed for 44 impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no material charges for impairment of equity investments in 2006, 2005 or 2004. Repair parts inventories are carried in order to provide a dependable supply of quality parts for servicing the Companys PP&E, particularly its glass melting furnaces and molding machines. The Company evaluates the recoverability of repair parts inventories based on undiscounted projected cash flows, excluding interest and taxes, when factors indicate that impairment may exist. If impairment exists, the repair parts are written down to fair value. The Company continually monitors the carrying value of repair parts for recoverability, especially in light of changing business circumstances. For example, technological advances related to, and changes in, the estimated future demand for products produced on the equipment to which the repair parts relate may make the repair parts obsolete. In these circumstances, the Company writes down the repair parts to fair value. As part of the actions taken to close its Godfrey, Illinois machine parts manufacturing operation, the Company recognized a write down of excess repair parts inventories of $7.9 million in 2006. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Benefit Plans Significant Estimates The determination of pension obligations and the related pension expense or credits to operations involves significant estimates. The most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on assets used in calculating the pension charges or credits for the year. The Company uses discount rates based on yields of highly rated fixed income debt securities at the end of the year. At December 31, 2006, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 5.49%. The Company uses an expected long term rate of return on assets that is based on both past performance of the various plans assets and estimated future performance of the assets. Due to the nature of the plans assets and the volatility of debt and equity markets, results may vary significantly from year to year. For example, actual returns in the Companys two largest plans were negative in each of the years 2000 2002. The returns exceeded 20% in 2003, 18% in 2004, 10% in 2005 and 16% in 2006. The Company refers to average historical returns over longer periods (up to 10 years) in determining its expected rates of return because short term fluctuations in market values do not reflect the rates of return the Company expects to achieve based upon its long term investing strategy. For 2007, the Companys estimated weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension assets is 8.1% compared to 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The Company recorded pension expense of $8.7million, $4.0 million, and $36.8 million in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively, from its principal defined benefit pension plans. The increase in net pension expense in 2006 resulted from lower return rates, the use of an updated mortality table reflecting longer lifetimes, and higher amortization. Depending on currency translation rates, the Company expects to record approximately $1.7 million of pension income for the full year of 2007. The expected improvement in 2007 is principally the result of higher asset values in the U.S. plans. Future effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance. For example, a one half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding the expected return on assets would result in a change of approximately $19 million in pretax pension expense for the full year 2007. In addition, changes in external factors, including the fair values of plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities, could have a significant effect on the recognition of funded status as described below. Recognition of Funded Status In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (FAS No. 158), Employers Accounting for 45 Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. The Company adopted the provisions of FAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006. FAS No. 158 requires employers to adjust the assets and liabilities related to defined benefit plans so that the amounts reflected on the balance sheet represent the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans. These funded status amounts are measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date. For pension plans, the fair value of plan assets is compared to the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO). For other postretirement benefit plans, the fair value of plan assets is compared to the Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO). In the Companys case, the required adjustments resulted in a non cash charge of $639.9 million ($617.1 million after tax) to the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income component of share owners equity. The most significant of the required adjustments was a $502.5 million reduction of the prepaid pension asset at December 31, 2006. Funding and Credit Compliance The Company believes it will not be required to make cash contributions to the U.S. plans for at least several years. The Company expects to contribute approximately $55 million to its non U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2007, down from $69.5 million in 2006. The covenants under the Companys Secured Credit Agreement were not affected by the $617.1 million reduction in the Companys net worth under FAS No. 158. Contingencies and Litigation The Company believes that its ultimate asbestos related liability (i.e., its indemnity payments or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees) cannot be estimated with certainty. The Companys ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the United States, the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation, the continued use of litigation screenings to generate new lawsuits, the large number of claims asserted or filed by parties who claim prior exposure to asbestos materials but have no present physical impairment as a result of such exposure, and the growing number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy. The Company believes that the bankruptcies of additional co defendants have resulted in an acceleration of the presentation and disposition of a number of claims, which would otherwise have been presented and disposed of over the next several years. The Company continues to monitor trends which may affect its ultimate liability and continues to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the Company. The Company conducts a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs annually in connection with finalizing and reporting its annual results of operations, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review. If the results of an annual comprehensive review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is insufficient to cover its estimated future asbestos related costs, then the Company will record an appropriate charge to increase the accrued liability. The Company believes that an estimation of the reasonably probable amount of the contingent liability for claims not yet asserted against the Company is not possible beyond a period of several years. Therefore, while the results of future annual comprehensive reviews cannot be determined, the Company expects the addition of one year to the estimation period will result in an annual charge. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a charge of $120.0 million (pretax and after tax) to increase its accrued liability for asbestos related costs. This amount was reduced from the 2005 charge of $135.0 million. The factors and developments that particularly affected the determination of the amount of this increase in the accrual included the following: i) the decline in serious disease filings against the Company and the significant decline in the non malignancy filings; (ii) the Companys successful 46 litigation record during the year; (iii) the legislative developments and court rulings in several states; and (iv) the impact these and other factors had on the Companys valuation of existing and future claims. The Companys estimates are based on a number of factors as described further in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. Income tax expense was $126.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. Judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. The Company believes that its recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, FAS No. 109 requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is largely dependent upon projected near term profitability including the effects of tax planning. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which the Company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses. In the United States, the Company has recorded significant deferred tax assets, the largest of which relate to net operating losses, capital losses, tax credits and the accrued liability for asbestos related costs that are not deductible until paid. The deferred tax assets are partially offset by deferred tax liabilities, the most significant of which relate to the prepaid pension asset and accelerated depreciation. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of U.S. deferred tax assets not offset by deferred tax liabilities. Under the new accounting standard for recognition of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans (as described above under Pension Benefit Plans), in 2006 the Company was required to write off a significant portion of its prepaid pension asset, principally related to the U.S. pension plans, and increase recorded liabilities for other U.S. plans. The related deferred tax liabilities and assets were also adjusted. As a result, in 2006 the Company was required to record an additional valuation allowance of $197.5 million. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates, and changes in commodity prices, principally energy. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating energy prices. In addition, the Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of fixed and floating rate debt and to reduce interest expense. These instruments carry varying degrees of counterparty credit risk. To mitigate this risk, the Company has established limits on the exposure with individual counterparties and the Company regularly monitors these exposures. Substantially all of these exposures are with counterparties that are rated single A or above. 47 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Earnings of operations outside the United States A substantial portion of the Companys operations are conducted by subsidiaries outside the U.S. The primary international markets served by the Companys subsidiaries are in Canada, Australia, South America (principally Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela), and Europe (principally Italy, France, the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Poland). In general, revenues earned and costs incurred by the Companys major international operations are denominated in their respective local currencies. Consequently, the Companys reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the international markets in which the Companys subsidiaries operate. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the reported dollar value of local currency earnings generally decreases; when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the reported U.S. dollar value of local currency earnings generally increases. The Company does not have any significant foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in the U.S. dollar, however, if economic conditions in Venezuela were to decline, the Company may be required to adopt the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for its subsidiaries in that country. The Company does not hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to earnings of operations outside the United States. Borrowings not denominated in the functional currency Because the Companys subsidiaries operate within their local economic environment, the Company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with borrowings denominated in the local currency to the extent practicable where debt financing is desirable or necessary. Considerations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans, tax implications, and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms. In those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency, this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. In those countries where the U.S. dollar is the designated functional currency, however, local currency borrowings expose the Company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. Available excess funds of a subsidiary may be redeployed through intercompany loans to other subsidiaries for debt repayment, capital investment, or other cash requirements. Generally, each intercompany loan is denominated in the lenders local currency giving rise to foreign currency exchange rate risk for the borrower. To mitigate this risk, the lender generally enters into a forward exchange contract which effectively swaps the intercompany loan and related interest to its local currency. Certain of the Companys subsidiaries in the United States and Europe have entered into short term forward exchange contracts which effectively swap intercompany loans to other subsidiaries that are denominated in the functional currency of the borrowers. These contracts swap the principal amount of loans and in some cases they swap the related interest. The Company believes the near term exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk of its foreign currency risk sensitive instruments was not material at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates applicable to its U.S. dollar indebtedness. 48 The Company has entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $1.25 billion that mature from 2007 through 2013. The swaps were executed in order to: (i) convert a portion of the senior notes and senior debentures fixed rate debt into floating rate debt; (ii) maintain a capital structure containing appropriate amounts of fixed and floating rate debt; and (iii) reduce net interest payments and expense in the near term. Under the swaps, the Company receives fixed rate interest amounts (equal to interest on the corresponding hedged note) and pays interest at a six month U.S. LIBOR rate (set in arrears) plus a margin spread (see table below). The interest rate differential on each swap is recognized as an adjustment of interest expense during each six month period over the term of the agreement. The following table provides information about the Companys interest rate sensitivity related to its significant debt obligations and interest rate swaps at December 31, 2006. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contract maturity date. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the swap contracts. (dollars in millions) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 There after Total Fair Value at 12/31/2006 Long term debt at variable rate: Principal by expected maturity $ 26.2 $ 14.4 $ 34.0 $ 60.6 $ 171.1 $ 644.7 $ 951.0 $ 951.0 Avg. principal outstanding $ 898.3 $ 845.5 $ 828.5 $ 797.0 $ 688.4 $ 605.9 Avg. interest rate 6.60 % 6.60 % 6.52 % 6.52 % 6.52 % 6.52 % Long term debt at fixed rate: Principal by expected maturity $ 300.0 $ 250.0 $ 850.0 $ 250.0 $ 450.0 $ 2,021.2 $ 4,121.2 $ 4,209.9 Avg. principal outstanding $ 3,933.7 $ 3,665.0 $ 2,827.5 $ 2,565.0 $ 2,190.0 $ 2,021.2 Avg. interest rate 8.00 % 8.03 % 7.83 % 7.81 % 7.83 % 7.83 % Interest rate swaps (pay variable/receive fixed): Notional by expected maturity $ 300.0 $ 250.0 $ 250.0 $ 450.0 $ 1,250.0 $ 28.4 Avg. notional outstanding $ 1,062.5 $ 793.8 $ 700.0 $ 543.8 $ 450.0 $ 450.0 Avg. pay rate margin over U.S. LIBOR 3.62 % 3.52 % 3.52 % 3.61 % 3.70 % 3.70 % Avg. fixed receive rate 7.85 % 7.91 % 7.98 % 8.12 % 8.25 % 8.25 % The Company believes the near term exposure to interest rate risk of its debt obligations and interest rate swaps has not changed materially since December 31, 2005. Commodity Price Risk The Company has exposure to commodity price risk, principally related to energy. The Company believes it can mitigate a portion of this risk by passing commodity cost changes through to customers. In addition, the Company enters into commodity futures contracts related to forecasted natural gas requirements, the objectives of which are to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid 49 for natural gas and the related volatility in cash flows. The Company continually evaluates the natural gas market with respect to its forecasted usage requirements over the next twelve to twenty four months and periodically enters into commodity futures contracts in order to hedge a portion of its usage requirements over that period. Significant transactions related to commodity price risk are as follows: At December 31, 2006, the Company had entered into commodity futures contracts for approximately 57% (approximately 13,450,000 MM BTUs) of its expected North American natural gas usage for full year of 2007 and approximately 9% (approximately 2,160,000 MM BTUs) for the full year of 2008. The Company believes the near term exposure to commodity price risk of its commodity futures contracts was not material at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Forward Looking Statements This document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. Forward looking statements reflect the Companys current expectations and projections about future events at the time, and thus involve uncertainty and risk. It is possible the Companys future financial performance may differ from expectations due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to the following: (1) foreign currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar, (2) changes in capital availability or cost, including interest rate fluctuations, (3) the general political, economic and competitive conditions in markets and countries where the Company has its operations, including disruptions in the supply chain, competitive pricing pressures, inflation or deflation, and changes in tax rates and laws, (4) consumer preferences for alternative forms of packaging, (5) fluctuations in raw material and labor costs, (6) availability of raw materials, (7) costs and availability of energy, (8) transportation costs, (9) the ability of the Company to raise selling prices commensurate with energy and other cost increases, (10) consolidation among competitors and customers, (11) the ability of the Company to integrate operations of acquired businesses and achieve expected synergies, (12) unanticipated expenditures with respect to environmental, safety and health laws, (13) the performance by customers of their obligations under purchase agreements, and (14) the timing and occurrence of events which are beyond the control of the Company, including events related to asbestos related claims. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. Any forward looking statements in this document are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Forward looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from expectations. While the Company continually reviews trends and uncertainties affecting the Companys results of operations and financial condition, the Company does not assume any obligation to update or supplement any particular forward looking statements contained in this document. 50
