ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Following are the Companys net sales by segment and segment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. The Companys measure of profit for its reportable segments is Segment Operating Profit, which consists of consolidated earnings from continuing operations before interest income, interest expense, provision for income taxes and minority share owners interests in earnings of subsidiaries and excludes amounts related to certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations as well as certain retained corporate costs. The segment data presented below is prepared in accordance with FAS No. 131. The line titled reportable segment totals, however, is a non GAAP measure when presented outside of the financial statement footnotes. Management has included reportable segment totals below to facilitate the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. The Companys management uses Segment Operating Profit, in combination with selected cash flow information, to evaluate performance and to allocate resources.

Executive Overview Years ended December 2008 and 2007 Net sales from continuing operations were $318.0 million higher than the prior year principally resulting from improved pricing and favorable product mix across all regions, as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates, principally the Euro. Lower unit shipments partially offset these favorable increases. Segment Operating Profit for reportable segments was $49.8 million higher than the prior year. The benefits of higher selling prices, improved product mix, improvements in glass plant operating efficiencies, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates were partially offset by inflationary cost increases in manufacturing and delivery costs and lower sales volume. Interest expense in 2008 was $253.0 million compared with interest expense from continuing operations of $348.6 million in 2007. Included in the 2007 interest expense was $9.5 million for both note repurchase premiums and the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the November 2007 repurchase of the $625.0 million 8.75% Senior Secured Notes. Exclusive of these items, interest expense decreased approximately $86.1 million. The decrease is principally due to lower variable interest rates under the Companys bank credit agreement and on long term debt variable and swapped rates as well as lower overall debt levels, partially offset by an increase in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease 26 Table of Contents is also due to the non recurrence of interest on debt that was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2007 with the proceeds from the plastics sale. This interest was previously allocated to discontinued operations until the date of the sale. Interest income for continuing operations for 2008 was $38.6 million compared to $42.3 million for 2007. Net earnings from continuing operations for 2008 were $251.5 million, or $1.48 per share (diluted), compared to earnings from continuing operations of $299.3 million, or $1.78 per share (diluted) for 2007. Earnings in both periods included items that management considered not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased net earnings in 2008 by $393.7 million, or $2.32 per share, and decreased net earnings in 2007 by $194.4 million, or $1.16 per share. Cash payments for asbestos related costs were $210.2 million for 2008 compared to $347.1 million for 2007. The decrease is due to reduced funding for settlements of certain claims on an accelerated basis. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment for continuing operations was $361.7 million for 2008 compared to $292.5 million for 2007. The 2008 amount is in a range consistent with long term historical levels. The increase is also due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Results of Operations Comparison of 2008 with 2007 Net Sales The Companys net sales by segment for 2008 and 2007 are presented in the following table. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Europe $ 3,497.8 $ 3,298.7 North America 2,209.7 2,271.3 South America 1,135.9 970.7 Asia Pacific 964.1 934.3 Reportable segment totals 7,807.5 7,475.0 Other 77.2 91.7 Net Sales $ 7,884.7 $ 7,566.7 The Companys net sales increased $318.0 million, or 4.2%, over 2007. The change in net sales of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Net sales 2007 $ 7,475.0 Net effect of price and mix $ 572.0 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 274.5 Decreased sales volume (514.0 ) Total effect on net sales 332.5 Net sales 2008 $ 7,807.5 27 Table of Contents Segment Operating Profit Operating Profit for the reportable segments in the table below includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments operations are included in Retained Corporate Costs and Other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2008 2007 Europe $ 477.8 $ 433.0 North America 185.2 265.1 South America 331.0 254.9 Asia Pacific 162.8 154.0 Reportable segment totals 1,156.8 1,107.0 Retained corporate costs and other (0.7 ) (78.8 ) Segment Operating Profit for reportable segments for 2008 increased $49.8 million, or 4.5%, to $1,156.8 million, compared with Segment Operating Profit of $1,107.0 million for 2007. The change in Segment Operating Profit for reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Segment Operating Profit 2007 $ 1,107.0 Net effect of price and mix $ 572.0 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 56.0 Manufacturing and delivery costs (468.0 ) Decreased sales volume (116.0 ) Operating expense (28.0 ) Other 33.8 Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit 49.8 Segment Operating Profit 2008 $ 1,156.8 Interest Expense Interest expense in 2008 was $253.0 million compared with interest expense from continuing operations of $348.6 million in 2007. Included in the 2007 interest expense was $9.5 million for both note repurchase premiums and the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the November 2007 repurchase of the $625.0 million 8.75% Senior Secured Notes. Exclusive of these items, interest expense decreased approximately $86.1 million. The decrease is principally due to lower variable interest rates under the Companys bank credit agreement and on long term debt variable and swapped rates as well as lower overall debt levels, partially offset by an increase in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease is also due to the non recurrence of interest on debt that was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2007 with the proceeds from the plastics sale. This interest was previously allocated to discontinued operations until the date of the sale. 28 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income for continuing operations for 2008 was $38.6 million compared to $42.3 million for 2007. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2008 was 42.4%, compared with 29.2% for 2007. The provision for 2008 includes a net expense of $33.3 million related to tax legislation, restructuring, and other. The provision for 2007 includes a benefit of $13.5 million for the recognition of tax credits related to restructuring of investments in certain European operations. Excluding those items and the effects in both periods of pretax items for which taxes are separately calculated and recorded in the period, the Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2008 was 24.0% compared to 24.4% for 2007. The Company expects that the effective tax rate will not change significantly in 2009. Minority Share Owners Interest in Earnings of Subsidiaries Minority share owners interest in earnings of subsidiaries for 2008 was $70.2 million compared to $59.5 million for 2007. The increase is primarily attributed to higher earnings from the Companys operations in South America. Earnings from Continuing Operations For 2008, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations of $251.5 million compared to earnings from continuing operations of $299.3 million for 2007. The after tax effects of the items excluded from Segment Operating Profit, the 2008 and 2007 international net tax benefits, and the 2007 additional interest charges, increased or decreased earnings in 2008 and 2007 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2008 2007 Net expense related to tax legislation, restructuring, and other $ (34.8 ) $ Gain recognition from foreign tax credits 13.5 Restructuring and asset impairments (110.1 ) (84.1 ) Increase in the accrual for future asbestos related costs (248.8 ) (115.0 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees (8.8 ) Total $ (393.7 ) $ (194.4 ) Executive Overview Years ended December 2007 and 2006 Net sales from continuing operations were $916.3 million higher than the prior year principally resulting from improved pricing, increased unit shipments, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Segment Operating Profit for reportable segments was $372.2 million higher than the prior year. The benefits of higher selling prices, improved productivity, increased unit shipments, and favorable exchange rates were partially offset by inflationary cost increases. 29 Table of Contents Interest expense from continuing operations for 2007 was $348.6 million compared to $349.0 million for 2006. Included in the 2007 interest expense was $9.5 million for both note repurchase premiums and the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the November 2007 repurchase of the $625.0 million 8.75% Senior Secured Notes. Included in the 2006 interest expense was $17.5 million for both note repurchase premiums and the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the June 2006 refinancing of the Companys previous credit agreement and the July 2006 repurchase of approximately $150 million principal amount of the 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2009. Exclusive of these items, interest expense increased approximately $7.6 million. A significant portion of the increase is interest on debt that was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2007 with the proceeds from the plastics sale. This interest was previously allocated to discontinued operations until the date of the sale. Interest income for continuing operations for 2007 was $42.3 million compared to $19.2 million for 2006. The increase of $23.1 million is primarily due to interest earned as a result of investing a portion of the proceeds from the plastics July 31, 2007 sale until the funds were used to repay senior secured debt in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net earnings from continuing operations for 2007 were $299.3 million, or $1.78 per share (diluted), compared to a loss of $3.8 million, or $0.17 per share (diluted) for 2006. Earnings in both periods included items that management considered not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased net earnings in 2007 by $194.4 million, or $1.16 per share, and decreased net earnings in 2006 by $177.0 million, or $1.15 per share. Cash payments for asbestos related costs were $347.1 million for 2007 compared to $162.5 million for 2006. Cash payments increased in part to fund, on an accelerated basis, settlements of certain claims on terms favorable to the Company. Cash payments were also used, in part, to reduce the deferred amounts payable for previously settled claims to approximately $34 million as of December 31, 2007, from approximately $82 million as of December 31, 2006. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment for continuing operations was $292.5 million for 2007 compared to $285.0 million for 2006. Results of Operations Comparison of 2007 with 2006 Net Sales The Companys net sales by segment for 2007 and 2006 are presented in the following table. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Europe $ 3,298.7 $ 2,846.6 North America 2,271.3 2,110.4 South America 970.7 796.5 Asia Pacific 934.3 804.9 Reportable segment totals 7,475.0 6,558.4 Other 91.7 92.0 Net Sales $ 7,566.7 $ 6,650.4 30 Table of Contents The Companys net sales increased $916.3 million, or 13.8%, over 2006. The change in net sales can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Net sales 2006 $ 6,650.4 Net effect of price and mix $ 322.8 Increased sales volume 144.7 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 448.8 Total effect on net sales 916.3 Net sales 2007 $ 7,566.7 The increase in reported sales from the effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates resulted principally from the stronger Euro and Australian dollar. Segment Operating Profit Operating Profit for the reportable segments in the table below includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments operations are included in Retained Corporate Costs and Other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Europe $ 433.0 $ 249.6 North America 265.1 187.3 South America 254.9 195.0 Asia Pacific 154.0 102.9 Reportable segment totals 1,107.0 734.8 Retained corporate costs and other (78.8 ) (76.6 ) Segment Operating Profit for reportable segments for 2007 increased $372.2 million, or 50.7%, to $1,107.0 million, compared with Segment Operating Profit of $734.8 million for 2006. 31 Table of Contents The change in Segment Operating Profit for reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Segment Operating Profit 2006 $ 734.8 Net effect of price and mix $ 323.0 Productivity and production volume 80.0 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 52.0 Increased sales volume 34.4 Warehouse, delivery and other costs 25.9 Operating expense 25.3 Manufacturing inflation, net of cost savings (152.0 ) Other (16.4 ) Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit 372.2 Segment Operating Profit 2007 $ 1,107.0 Interest Expense Interest expense from continuing operations for 2007 was $348.6 million compared to $349.0 million for 2006. Included in the 2007 interest expense was $9.5 million for both note repurchase premiums and the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the November 2007 repurchase of the $625.0 million 8.75% Senior Secured Notes. Included in the 2006 interest expense was $17.5 million for both note repurchase premiums and the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the June 2006 refinancing of the Companys previous credit agreement and the July 2006 repurchase of approximately $150 million principal amount of the 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2009. Exclusive of these items, interest expense increased approximately $7.6 million. A significant portion of the increase is interest on debt that was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2007 with the proceeds from the plastics sale. This interest was previously allocated to discontinued operations until the date of the sale. Interest Income Interest income for continuing operations for 2007 was $42.3 million compared to $19.2 million for 2006. The increase of $23.1 million is primarily due to interest earned as a result of investing a portion of the proceeds from the July 31, 2007 plastics sale until the funds were used to repay senior secured debt in the fourth quarter of 2007. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2007 was 29.2%, compared with 75.9% for 2006. Excluding the effects of separately taxed items in both periods, the Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2007 was 24.4% compared with 40.3% for 2006. The reduction is principally due to: (1) a change in mix of earnings to jurisdictions where the Company is subject to lower effective rates, and (2) the effect of higher earnings and lower interest costs in the U.S., where the Company has recognized a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. Minority Share Owners Interest in Earnings of Subsidiaries Minority share owners interest in earnings of subsidiaries for 2007 was $59.5 million compared to $43.6 million for 2006. The increase is primarily attributed to higher earnings from the Companys operations in South America. 32 Table of Contents Earnings from Continuing Operations For 2007, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations of $299.3 million compared to a loss from continuing operations of $3.8 million for 2006. The after tax effects of the items excluded from Segment Operating Profit, the 2007 and 2006 international net tax benefits, and the additional interest charges, increased or decreased earnings in 2007 and 2006 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2007 2006 Gain recognition from foreign tax credits $ 13.5 $ Curtailment of postretirement benefits in The Netherlands 11.2 Reversal of non U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowance partially offset by charges related to international tax restructuring 5.7 Restructuring and asset impairments (84.1 ) (27.7 ) Increase in the accrual for future asbestos related costs (115.0 ) (120.0 ) CEO transition charge and other (20.7 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees (8.8 ) (17.1 ) Loss from the mark to market effect of natural gas hedge contracts (8.4 ) Total $ (194.4 ) $ (177.0 ) Items Excluded from Reportable Segment Totals Retained Corporate Costs and Other Retained corporate costs and other for 2008 was $0.7 million compared with $78.8 million for 2007. Beginning in 2008, the Company revised its method of allocating corporate expenses. The Company decreased slightly the percentage allocation based on sales and significantly expanded the number of functions included in the allocation based on cost of services. It is not practicable to quantify the net effect of these changes on periods prior to 2008. However, the effect for 2008 was to reduce the amount of retained corporate costs by approximately $38.0 million. Also contributing to the decrease were lower accruals for self insured risks and increased pension income in 2008. Retained corporate costs and other for 2007 was $78.8 million compared with $76.6 million for 2006. Restructuring and Asset Impairments During 2008, the Company recorded charges totaling $133.3 million ($110.1 million after tax and minority share owners interests), for additional restructuring and asset impairment principally in North America and Europe, with additional charges across all segments as well as in Retained Corporate Costs and Other. The charges reflect the additional decisions reached in the Companys ongoing strategic review of its global manufacturing footprint. See Note 17 for additional information. During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, the Company recorded charges totaling $100.3 million ($84.1 million after tax), for restructuring and asset impairment in South America, Europe, and North 33 Table of Contents America. The charges reflect the initial decisions of the Companys global profitability review. See Note 17 for additional information. In September 2006, the Company announced the permanent closing of its Godfrey, Illinois machine parts manufacturing operation. The facility was closed by the end of the year. This closing is part of a broad initiative to reduce working capital and improve system costs. The Company also closed a small recycling facility in Ohio. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $29.7 million ($27.7 million after tax) in the third quarter of 2006. The closing of these facilities resulted in the elimination of approximately 260 jobs and a corresponding reduction in the Companys workforce. The Company anticipates that it will pay out approximately $11.5 million in cash related to insurance, benefits, plant clean up, and other plant closing costs. The Company expects that the majority of these costs will be paid out by the end of 2009. Charge for Asbestos Related Costs The fourth quarter 2008 charge for asbestos related costs was $250.0 million ($248.8 million after tax), compared to the fourth quarter 2007 charge of $115.0 million (pretax and after tax). The larger 2008 charge reflects higher filing rates and average disposition costs for 2008 and the next several years than previously estimated. These charges resulted from the Companys comprehensive annual review of asbestos related liabilities and costs. In each year, the Company concluded that an increase in the accrued liability was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims pending and expected to be filed during the several years following the completion of the comprehensive review. See Critical Accounting Estimates for further information. Asbestos related cash payments for 2008 were $210.2 million, a decrease of $136.9 million from 2007. As in 2007, cash payments were used in part to fund, on an accelerated basis, settlements of certain claims on terms favorable to the Company. Deferred amounts payable were approximately $34.0 million at both December 31, 2008 and 2007. During 2008, the Company received approximately 5,000 new filings and disposed of approximately 8,000 claims. As of December 31, 2008, the number of asbestos related claims pending against the Company was approximately 11,000. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet all asbestos related obligations on a short term and long term basis. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. CEO and Other Transition Charges The Company recorded a 2006 charge of $20.8 million ($20.7 million after tax) associated with the separation agreement with its former CEO and with several members of the European management team. The charge also included costs related to the employment agreement with the Companys new CEO. Curtailment of Postretirement Benefits in The Netherlands The Company recorded a 2006 gain of $15.9 million ($11.2 million after tax) related to curtailment of certain postretirement benefits in The Netherlands as a result of certain improvements in retiree medical benefits offered by the government. 34 Table of Contents Mark to Market Effect of Natural Gas Hedge Contracts During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company determined that the commodity futures contracts related to forecasted natural gas requirements did not meet all of the documentation requirements to qualify for special hedge accounting treatment and began to recognize all changes in fair value of these contracts in current earnings. The Company completed the documentation and re designation of its natural gas hedge contracts and began to apply special hedge accounting as of April 1, 2005. The total unrealized pretax loss recorded in 2006 was $8.7 million. Tax Benefits and Charges In 2008 the Company recorded a net tax charge of $33.3 million ($34.8 million after minority share owners interest) related to tax legislation, restructuring, and other. In 2007 the Company recorded a tax benefit of $13.5 million for recognition of tax credits related to restructuring of investments in certain European operations. In 2006 the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $5.7 million from the reversal of a valuation allowance against certain non U.S. deferred tax assets due to improving operations, partially offset by charges related to international tax restructuring. Discontinued Operations On July 31, 2007, the Company completed the sale of its plastics packaging business to Rexam PLC for approximately $1.825 billion in cash. As required by FAS No. 144,Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the Company has presented the results of operations for the plastics packaging business in the Consolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 as discontinued operations. Interest expense was allocated to the discontinued operations based on debt that was required by an amendment to the Secured Credit Agreement to be repaid from the net proceeds. Amounts for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. The following summarizes the revenues and expenses of the discontinued operations as reported in the consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated: 35 Table of Contents Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 Net sales $ 455.0 $ 771.6 Manufacturing, shipping and delivery (343.5 ) (602.9 ) Gross profit 111.5 168.7 Selling and administrative (20.7 ) (34.4 ) Research, development and engineering (8.3 ) (15.1 ) Interest expense (80.6 ) (139.2 ) Other income (0.1 ) 2.9 Other expense (1.2 ) (5.4 ) Earnings (loss) before items below 0.6 (22.5 ) (Provision) credit for income taxes 2.4 (1.2 ) Minority share owners interests in earnings of subsidiaries (0.2 ) Gain on sale of discontinued operations 1,038.5 Net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations $ 1,041.3 $ (23.7 ) The 2007 gain on the sale of discontinued operations of $1,038.5 million includes charges totaling $62.1 million for debt retirement costs, consisting principally of redemption premiums and write off of unamortized fees, and a gain of $8.7 million for curtailment and settlement of pension and other postretirement benefits. The gain also includes a net provision for income taxes of $38.2 million, consisting of taxes on the gain of $445.0 million that are substantially offset by a credit of $406.8 million for the reversal of valuation allowances against existing tax loss carryforwards. The sale agreement provides for an adjustment of the selling price based on working capital levels and certain other factors. The gain on sale of discontinued operations of $6.8 million reported in 2008 relates to an adjustment of the 2007 gain on the sale of the plastics packaging business mainly related to finalizing certain tax allocations and an adjustment to the selling price in accordance with procedures set forth in the final contract. Capital Resources and Liquidity Current and Long Term Debt The Companys total debt at December 31, 2008 was $3.33 billion, compared to $3.71 billion at December 31, 2007. On June 14, 2006, the Companys subsidiary borrowers entered into the Secured Credit Agreement (the Agreement). At December 31, 2008, the Agreement included a $900.0 million revolving credit facility, a 225.0 million Australian dollar term loan, and a 110.8 million Canadian dollar term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of June 15, 2012. It also included a $191.5 million term loan and a 191.5 million term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of June 14, 2013. As a result of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and several of its subsidiaries, the Company believes that the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility was reduced by $32.3 million. After further deducting amounts attributable to letters of credit and overdraft facilities that 36 Table of Contents are supported by the revolving credit facility, at December 31, 2008 the Companys subsidiary borrowers had unused credit of $768.4 million available under the Agreement. The Agreement contains various covenants that restrict, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur certain liens, make certain investments and acquisitions, become liable under contingent obligations in certain defined instances only, make restricted junior payments, make certain asset sales within guidelines and limits, make capital expenditures beyond a certain threshold, engage in material transactions with shareholders and affiliates, participate in sale and leaseback financing arrangements, alter its fundamental business, amend certain outstanding debt obligations, and prepay certain outstanding debt obligations. The Agreement also contains one financial maintenance covenant, a Leverage Ratio, that requires the Company not to exceed a ratio calculated by dividing consolidated total debt, less cash and cash equivalents, by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Agreement. The Leverage Ratio could restrict the ability of the Company to undertake additional financing to the extent that such financing would cause the Leverage Ratio to exceed the specified maximum. Failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default under the Agreement. In such an event, the Company could not request borrowings under the revolving facility, and all amounts outstanding under the Agreement, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. If an event of default occurs under the Agreement and the lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Agreement to become due and payable, this would result in a default under a number of other outstanding debt securities and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to these debt securities. A default or event of default under the Agreement, indentures or agreements governing other indebtedness could also lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions. The Leverage Ratio also determines pricing under the Agreement. The interest rate on borrowings under the Agreement is, at the Companys option, the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Agreement. These rates include a margin linked to the Leverage Ratio and the borrowers senior secured debt rating. The margins range from 0.875% to 1.75% for Eurocurrency Rate loans and from 0.125% to 0.75% for Base Rate loans. In addition, a facility fee is payable on the revolving credit facility commitments ranging from 0.20% to 0.50% per annum linked to the Leverage Ratio. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Agreement at December 31, 2008 was 4.07%. As of December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and restrictions in the Agreement. In addition, the Company believes that it will remain in compliance and that its ability to borrow funds under the Agreement will not be adversely affected by the covenants and restrictions. During the second quarter of 2008, the Company used cash from operations and borrowings under the Agreement to retire $250 million principal amount of 7.35% Senior Notes which matured in May 2008. During March 2007, a subsidiary of the Company issued Senior Notes totaling 300.0 million. The notes bear interest at 6.875% and are due March 31, 2017. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries. The proceeds were used to retire the $300 million principal amount of 8.10% Senior Notes which matured in May 2007, and to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit facility. On July 31, 2007, the Company completed the sale of its plastics packaging business to Rexam PLC for approximately $1.825 billion in cash. In accordance with an amendment of the Agreement that became effective upon completion of the sale of the plastics business, the Company was required to use the net proceeds (as defined in the Agreement) to repay senior secured debt. In addition, the amendment 37 Table of Contents provided for modification of certain covenants, including the elimination of the financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain a specified interest coverage ratio. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds in the third quarter of 2007 to redeem all $450.0 million of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes and repurchase $283.1 million of the 8.875% Senior Secured Notes. The remaining $566.9 million of the 8.875% Senior Secured Notes were repurchased or discharged in accordance with the indenture in October 2007. The remaining net proceeds, along with funds from operations and or additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility, were used to redeem all $625.0 million of the 8.75% Senior Secured Notes on November 15, 2007. The Company recorded $9.5 million of additional interest charges for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees. During October 2006, the Company entered into a 300 million European accounts receivable securitization program. The program extends through October 2011, subject to annual renewal of backup credit lines. In addition, the Company participates in a receivables financing program in the Asia Pacific region with a revolving funding commitment of 100 million Australian dollars and 25 million New Zealand dollars that extends through July 2009 and October 2009, respectively. Information related to the Companys accounts receivable securitization program is as follows: Dec. 31, Dec. 31, 2008 2007 Balance (included in short term loans) $ 293.7 $ 361.8 Weighted average interest rate 5.31 % 5.48 % Cash Flows For 2008, cash provided by continuing operating activities was $707.6 million compared with $625.1 million for 2007. The increase is mainly attributable to improved profit margins, lower interest, and lower payments for asbestos related costs, partially offset by higher working capital balances. Asbestos related payments for 2008 decreased $136.9 million to $210.2 million, compared with $347.1 million for 2007. The decrease is due to reduced funding for settlements of certain claims on an accelerated basis. During the current downturn in global financial markets, some companies may experience difficulties accessing their cash equivalents, drawing on revolvers, issuing debt, and raising capital generally, which could have a material adverse impact on their liquidity. Notwithstanding these adverse market conditions, the Company anticipates that cash flow from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs, debt service and other obligations on a short term (twelve months) and long term basis. Based on the Companys expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the Companys expected operating cash flow, the Company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and the resolution of presently pending 38 Table of Contents and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Companys liquidity on a short term or long term basis. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment (continuing operations) was $361.7 million compared with $292.5 million in the prior year. The Company capitalized $25.6 million and $27.0 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, under capital lease obligations with the related financing recorded as long term debt. The 2008 amount is in a range consistent with long term historical levels. The increase is also due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following information summarizes the Companys significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2008 (dollars in millions). Payments due by period Total Less than one year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Contractual cash obligations: Long term debt $ 2,883.2 $ 8.9 $ 412.1 $ 1,064.0 $ 1,398.2 Capital lease obligations 75.3 9.3 27.5 21.6 16.9 Operating leases 141.0 50.3 61.2 22.1 7.4 Interest (1) 1,216.9 207.7 361.2 316.6 331.4 Purchase obligations (2) 820.0 512.0 268.0 35.0 5.0 Pension benefit plan contributions 75.0 75.0 Postretirement benefit plan benefit payments (1) 260.3 22.3 43.8 42.7 151.5 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,471.7 $ 885.5 $ 1,173.8 $ 1,502.0 $ 1,910.4 Amount of commitment expiration per period Total Less than one year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Other commercial commitments: Standby letters of credit $ 81.3 $ 81.3 Total commercial commitments $ 81.3 $ 81.3 (1) Amounts based on rates and assumptions at December 31, 2008. 39 Table of Contents (2) The Companys purchase obligations included contracted amounts for energy and molds. The Company did not include ordinary course of business purchase orders in this amount as the majority of such purchase orders may be canceled. In cases where variable prices are involved, current market prices have been used. The Company does not believe such purchase orders will adversely affect our liquidity position. The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement with taxing authorities may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the financial statements are issued. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, estimates and assumptions are discussed within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where estimates and assumptions affect the Companys reported and expected financial results. The Company believes that accounting for property, plant and equipment, impairment of long lived assets, pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, and income taxes involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Property, Plant and Equipment The net carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) at December 31, 2008 totaled $2,645.6 million, representing 33% of total assets. Depreciation expense from continuing operations during 2008 totaled $431.0 million, representing approximately 5% of total costs and expenses. Given the significance of PP&E and associated depreciation to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the determinations of an assets cost basis and its economic useful life are considered to be critical accounting estimates. Cost Basis PP&E is recorded at cost, which is generally objectively quantifiable when assets are purchased singly. However, when assets are purchased in groups, or as part of a business, costs assigned to PP&E are based on an estimate of fair value of each asset at the date of acquisition. These estimates are based on assumptions about asset condition, remaining useful life and market conditions, among others. The Company frequently employs expert appraisers to aid in allocating cost among assets purchased as a group. 40 Table of Contents Included in the cost basis of PP&E are those costs which substantially increase the useful lives or capacity of existing PP&E. Significant judgment is needed to determine which costs should be capitalized under these criteria and which costs should be expensed as a repair or maintenance expenditure. For example, the Company frequently incurs various costs related to its existing glass melting furnaces and forming machines and must make a determination of which costs, if any, to capitalize. The Company relies on the experience and expertise of its operations and engineering staff to make reasonable and consistent judgments regarding increases in useful lives or capacity of PP&E. Estimated Useful Life PP&E is generally depreciated using the straight line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings each period over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by the Company, which may be less than its physical life. Managements assumptions regarding the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, product and process obsolescence, technical standards, and changes in market demand. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, technological advances, excessive wear and tear, or changes in customers requirements may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, the Company depreciates the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Changes in economic useful life assumptions did not have a material impact on the Companys reported results in 2008, 2007 or 2006. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Property, Plant, and Equipment As required by FAS No. 144, the Company tests for impairment of PP&E whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. PP&E held for use in the Companys business is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which cash flows can reasonably be identified, typically a geographic region. The Company evaluates the recoverability of property, plant, and equipment based on undiscounted projected cash flows, excluding interest and taxes. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset groups carrying amount exceeds its fair value. PP&E held for sale is reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Impairment testing requires estimation of the fair value of PP&E based on the discounted value of projected future cash flows generated by the asset group. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent managements best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include, among other things: industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, production costs and inflation. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. The Company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. In mid 2007, the Company began a strategic review of its global manufacturing footprint. The review is ongoing into 2009. As an initial result of this review, during 2007 and 2008, the Company recorded charges that included impairments of property, plant, and equipment across all segments including certain Retained Corporate Costs and Other activities. It is possible that the Company may conclude in the future that it will close or temporarily idle additional selected facilities or production lines and reduce headcount to increase operating performance and cash flows. As of December 31, 2008, no other decisions had been 41 Table of Contents made and no events had occurred that would require an additional evaluation of possible impairment in accordance with FAS No. 144. For additional information on charges recorded in 2008, 2007 and 2006, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill Goodwill at December 31, 2008 totaled $2,207.5 million, representing 27% of total assets. As required by FAS No. 142, the Company evaluates goodwill annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. The Company conducts its evaluation as of October 1 of each year. Goodwill impairment testing is performed using the business enterprise value (BEV) of each reporting unit which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free, after tax projected future cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer. This BEV is then compared to the book value of each reporting unit as of the measurement date to assess whether an impairment of goodwill may exist. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company completed its annual testing and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. The testing performed as of October 1, 2008, indicated a significant excess of BEV over book value for each unit. If the Companys projected future cash flows were substantially lower, or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital was substantially higher, the testing performed as of October 1, 2008, may have indicated an impairment of one or more of the Companys reporting units and, as a result, the related goodwill may also have been impaired. However, less significant changes in projected future cash flows or the assumed weighted average cost of capital would not have indicated an impairment. For example, if projected future cash flows had been decreased by 5%, or if the weighted average cost of capital had been increased by 5%, or both, the resulting lower BEVs would still have exceeded the book value of each reporting unit by a significant margin. The Company will monitor conditions throughout 2009 that might significantly affect the projections and variables used in the impairment test to determine if a review prior to October 1 may be appropriate. If the results of impairment testing confirm that a write down of goodwill is necessary, then the Company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of 2009, or earlier if appropriate. In the event the Company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill, the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth. Other Long Lived Assets Other long lived assets include, among others, equity investments and repair parts inventories. The Companys equity investments are non publicly traded ventures with other companies in businesses related to those of the Company. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2007 and 2008, the Company recorded charges that included impairments of an equity investment. For additional information on these charges, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company carries a significant amount of repair parts inventories in order to provide a dependable supply of quality parts for servicing the Companys PP&E, particularly its glass melting furnaces and forming machines. The Company evaluates the recoverability of repair parts inventories based on undiscounted projected cash flows, excluding interest and taxes, when factors indicate that impairment may exist. If impairment exists, the repair parts are written down to fair value. The Company continually monitors the carrying value of repair parts for recoverability, especially in light of changing business circumstances. For example, technological advances related to, and changes in, the estimated future 42 Table of Contents demand for products produced on the equipment to which the repair parts relate may make the repair parts obsolete. In these circumstances, the Company writes down the repair parts to fair value. For additional information on a charge recorded in 2006, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Benefit Plans Significant Estimates The determination of pension obligations and the related pension expense or credits to operations involves significant estimates. The most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The Company uses discount rates based on yields of high quality fixed rate debt securities at the end of the year. At December 31, 2008, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 6.29%. The Company uses an expected long term rate of return on assets that is based on both past performance of the various plans assets and estimated future performance of the assets. Due to the nature of the plans assets and the volatility of debt and equity markets, actual returns may vary significantly from year to year. The Company refers to average historical returns over longer periods (up to 10 years) in determining its expected rates of return because short term fluctuations in market values do not reflect the rates of return the Company expects to achieve based upon its long term investing strategy. For purposes of determining pension charges and credits in 2009, the Companys estimated weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.7% compared to 8.1% in 2008. The Company recorded pension expense (income) from continuing operations of $36.2 million, $3.4 million, and $(24.3) million in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively, from its principal defined benefit pension plans. The improvement in 2008 is principally a result of higher asset values in the U.S. plans at the beginning of 2008. Depending on currency translation rates, the Company expects to record approximately $20 million of pension expense for the full year of 2009. Future effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance. For example, a one half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding the expected return on assets would result in a change of approximately $18 million in the pretax pension amount for the full year 2009. In addition, changes in external factors, including the fair values of plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities, could have a significant effect on the recognition of funded status as described below. Recognition of Funded Status FAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, requires employers to adjust the assets and liabilities related to defined benefit plans so that the amounts reflected on the balance sheet represent the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans. These funded status amounts are measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and actuarially calculated benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2008, the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss component of share owners equity was increased by $1,080.1 million ($1,025.0 million after tax) to reflect a net decrease in the funded status of the Companys plans at that date. Funding Based on exchange rates at the end of 2008 the Company expects to contribute approximately $70 million to $75 million to its non U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2009, compared with $61.2 million in 2008. Depending on a number of factors, the Company may elect to contribute amounts in excess of minimum required amounts in order to improve the funded status of certain plans. The Company presently estimates it will not be required to make cash contributions to the U.S. plans during 2009. Contingencies and Litigation The Company believes that its ultimate asbestos related liability (i.e., its indemnity payments or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees) cannot be estimated with certainty. The Companys ability 43 Table of Contents reasonably to estimate its liability has been significantly affected by the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the United States, the inherent uncertainty of future disease incidence and claiming patterns, the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation and found liable for substantial damage awards, the use of mass litigation screenings to generate new lawsuits, the large number of claims asserted or filed by parties who claim prior exposure to asbestos materials but have no present physical impairment as a result of such exposure, and the significant number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy. The Company continues to monitor trends that may affect its ultimate liability and continues to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the Company. The Company conducts a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs annually in connection with finalizing and reporting its annual results of operations, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review. If the results of an annual comprehensive review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is insufficient to cover its estimated future asbestos related costs, then the Company will record an appropriate charge to increase the accrued liability. The Company believes that an estimation of the reasonably probable amount of the contingent liability for claims not yet asserted against the Company is not possible beyond a period of several years. Therefore, while the results of future annual comprehensive reviews cannot be determined, the Company expects the addition of one year to the estimation period will result in an annual charge. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a charge of $250.0 million ($248.8 million after tax) to increase its accrued liability for asbestos related costs. This amount was higher than the 2007 charge of $115.0 million. The larger 2008 charge reflects higher filing rates and average disposition costs for 2008 and the next several years than previously estimated. The factors and developments that particularly affected the determination of the amount of this increase in the accrual included the following: (i) the rates and average disposition costs of filings against the Company; (ii) the continuing evidence of irregularities associated with mass litigation screenings; (iii) the Companys successful litigation record; (iv) legislative developments and court rulings in several states; (v) the Companys strategy to accelerate settlements of certain claims on favorable terms; and (vi) the impact these and other factors had on the Companys valuation of existing and future claims. The Companys estimates are based on a number of factors as described further in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes as required by the provisions of FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates. Management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. In addition, under FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48) judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of uncertain income tax positions. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. During 2008, the Companys estimated unrecognized tax benefits increased by $44.0 million related to tax positions taken in prior years in non U.S. jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, FAS No. 109 requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or 44 Table of Contents all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is dependent upon projected profitability including the effects of tax planning. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which the Company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses. In the U.S., the Company has recorded significant deferred tax assets, the largest of which relate to foreign and other tax credits which amounted to $303.9 million at December 31, 2008, the accrued liability for asbestos related costs which amounted to $173.4 million at December 31, 2008 that are not deductible until paid and the pension liability which amounted to $122.6 million at December 31, 2008. The deferred tax assets are partially offset by deferred tax liabilities, the most significant of which relate to accelerated depreciation. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of U.S. deferred tax assets not offset by deferred tax liabilities. During the third quarter of 2007 the Company sold its discontinued plastics operations. For tax purposes, the gain on the sale was substantially offset by capital and net operating loss carryforwards. The credit for the corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance of $406.8 million was classified as a component of the gain on sale of discontinued operations. In 2007 the Company implemented a plan to restructure the ownership and intercompany obligations of certain foreign subsidiaries. These actions resulted in taxation of a significant portion of previously unremitted foreign earnings and will transfer a portion of the Companys debt service obligations to operations outside the U.S. in order to better balance operating cash flows with financing costs on a global basis. The foreign earnings reported as taxable in the U.S. were fully offset by net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits. Foreign tax credit carryforwards arising from the restructuring were fully offset by an increase in the valuation allowance. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates, and changes in commodity prices, principally energy and soda ash. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating energy prices. In addition, the Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of fixed rate debt and interest expense. These instruments carry varying degrees of counterparty credit risk. To mitigate this risk, the Company has established limits on the exposure with individual counterparties and the Company regularly monitors these exposures. Substantially all of these exposures are with counterparties that are rated single A or above. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Earnings of operations outside the United States A substantial portion of the Companys operations are conducted by subsidiaries outside the U.S. The primary international markets served by the Companys subsidiaries are in Canada, Australia, South America (principally Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela), and Europe (principally Italy, France, The Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Poland). In general, revenues earned and costs incurred by the Companys major international operations are denominated in their respective local currencies. Consequently, the Companys reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the international markets in which the Companys subsidiaries operate. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the reported dollar value of local currency earnings generally decreases; when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the reported U.S. dollar value of local currency earnings generally increases. The Company does not have any significant foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, however, if economic conditions in Venezuela were to decline, the Company may be required to adopt the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for its subsidiaries in that country. The Company does 45 Table of Contents not hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to earnings of operations outside the United States. Borrowings not denominated in the functional currency Because the Companys subsidiaries operate within their local economic environment, the Company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with borrowings denominated in the local currency to the extent practicable where debt financing is desirable or necessary. Considerations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans, tax implications, and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms. In those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency, this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. In those countries where the U.S. dollar is the designated functional currency, however, local currency borrowings expose the Company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. Available excess funds of a subsidiary may be redeployed through intercompany loans to other subsidiaries for debt repayment, capital investment, or other cash requirements. Generally, each intercompany loan is denominated in the lenders local currency giving rise to foreign currency exchange rate risk for the borrower. To mitigate this risk, the borrower generally enters into a forward exchange contract which effectively swaps the intercompany loan and related interest to its local currency. The Company believes the near term exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk of its foreign currency risk sensitive instruments was not material at December 31, 2008 and 2007. Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates applicable to its U.S. dollar indebtedness. The Company has entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $700 million that mature in 2010 and 2013. The swaps were executed in order to: (i) convert a portion of the senior notes and senior debentures fixed rate debt into floating rate debt; (ii) maintain a capital structure containing appropriate amounts of fixed and floating rate debt; and (iii) reduce net interest payments and expense in the near term. The Companys fixed to variable interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. Because the relevant terms of the swap agreements match the corresponding terms of the notes, there is no hedge ineffectiveness. Accordingly, the Company recorded the net of the fair market values of the swaps as a long term asset along with a corresponding net increase in the carrying value of the hedged debt. Under the swaps, the Company receives fixed rate interest amounts (equal to interest on the corresponding hedged note) and pays interest at a six month U.S. LIBOR rate (set in arrears) plus a margin spread. The interest rate differential on each swap is recognized as an adjustment of interest expense during each six month period over the term of the agreement. The following table provides information about the Companys interest rate sensitivity related to its significant debt obligations and interest rate swaps at December 31, 2008. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contract 46 Table of Contents maturity date. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the swap contracts. Fair There Value at (dollars in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 after Total 12/31/2008 Long term debt at variable rate: Principal by expected maturity $ 18.2 $ 20.1 $ 160.1 $ 153.6 $ 462.0 $ 25.9 $ 839.9 $ 839.9 Avg. principal outstanding 830.8 811.7 721.6 564.7 256.9 12.9 Avg. interest rate 4.07 % 4.07 % 4.07 % 4.07 % 4.07 % 4.07 % Long term debt at fixed rate: Principal by expected maturity $ 250.0 $ 450.0 $ 1,389.2 $ 2,089.2 $ 1,824.5 Avg. principal outstanding $ 2,089.2 $ 1,933.0 $ 1,839.2 $ 1,839.2 $ 1,558.0 $ 1,389.2 Avg. interest rate 7.31 % 7.30 % 7.29 % 7.29 % 7.11 % 6.98 % Interest rate swaps (pay variable/receive fixed): Notional by expected maturity $ 250.0 $ 450.0 $ 700.0 $ (29.4 ) Avg. notional outstanding $ 700.0 $ 543.8 $ 450.0 $ 450.0 $ 450.0 Avg. pay rate margin over U.S. LIBOR 3.52 % 3.61 % 3.70 % 3.70 % 3.70 % Avg. fixed receive rate 7.98 % 8.12 % 8.25 % 8.25 % 8.25 % The Company believes the near term exposure to interest rate risk of its debt obligations and interest rate swaps has not changed materially since December 31, 2007. Commodity Price Risk The Company has exposure to commodity price risk, principally related to energy. The Company believes it can mitigate a portion of this risk by passing commodity cost changes through to customers. In addition, the Company enters into commodity futures contracts related to forecasted natural gas requirements, the objectives of which are to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid for natural gas and the related volatility in cash flows. The Company continually evaluates the natural gas market with respect to its forecasted usage requirements over the next twelve to twenty four months and periodically enters into commodity futures contracts in order to hedge a portion of its usage requirements over that period. Significant transactions related to commodity price risk are as follows: At December 31, 2008, the Company had entered into commodity futures contracts for approximately 50% (approximately 10,200,000 MM BTUs) of its estimated North American usage requirements for the full year of 2009 and approximately 1% (approximately 240,000 MM BTUs) for the full year of 2010. The Company believes the near term exposure to commodity price risk of its commodity futures contracts was not material at December 31, 2008. 47 Table of Contents Forward Looking Statements This document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933.
