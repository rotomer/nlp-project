ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Following are the Companys net sales by segment and segment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 (dollars in millions). The Companys measure of profit for its reportable segments is Segment Operating Profit, which consists of consolidated earnings from continuing operations before interest income, interest expense, and provision for income taxes and excludes amounts related to certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations as well as certain retained corporate costs. The segment data presented below is prepared in accordance with general accounting principles for segment reporting. The line titled reportable segment totals, however, is a non GAAP measure when presented outside of the financial statement footnotes. Management has included reportable segment totals below to facilitate the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. The Companys management uses Segment Operating Profit, in combination with selected cash flow information, to evaluate performance and to allocate resources.

Executive Overview Years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 Net sales were $818.2 million lower than the prior year principally resulting from decreased shipments and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher selling prices and improved mix. Segment Operating Profit for reportable segments was $160.8 million lower than the prior year. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower sales volume and increased manufacturing and delivery costs resulting from higher unabsorbed fixed costs of approximately $302.0 million, primarily from production curtailments, as well as inflationary cost increases. The Company also recognized $28.0 million of foreign currency exchange losses in 2009 related to cash remittances out of Venezuela as part of the Companys cash management strategy. Partially offsetting these costs were higher selling prices and savings from permanent curtailment of plant capacity and realignment of selected operations. Interest expense in 2009 was $221.7 million compared with interest expense of $253.0 million in 2008. The 2009 amount includes $5.2 million of additional interest charges for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees, net of a gain from the termination of interest rate swap agreements following the May tender for the 7.50% Senior Debentures due May 2010. Exclusive of these 27 Table of Contents items, interest expense decreased approximately $36.5 million. The decrease is principally due to lower variable interest rates under the Companys bank credit agreement as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Interest income for 2009 was $28.6 million compared to $38.6 million for 2008. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company for 2009 were $161.8 million, or $0.95 per share (diluted), compared to $251.5 million, or $1.48 per share (diluted) for 2008. Earnings in both periods included items that management considered not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased net earnings in 2009 by $337.7 million, or $1.98 per share, and decreased net earnings in 2008 by $393.7 million, or $2.32 per share. Cash payments for asbestos related costs were $190.3 million for 2009 compared to $210.2 million for 2008. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment was $427.6 million for 2009 compared to $361.7 million for 2008. Results of Operations Comparison of 2009 with 2008 Net Sales The Companys net sales in 2009 were $7,066.5 million compared with $7,884.7 million in 2008, a decrease of $818.2 million, or 10.4%. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The change in net sales of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Net sales 2008 $ 7,807.5 Net effect of price and mix $ 377.0 Decreased sales volume (819.8 ) Effects of changing foreign currency rates (343.7 ) Total effect on net sales (786.5 ) Net sales 2009 $ 7,021.0 Segment Operating Profit Operating Profit of the reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments operations are included in Retained Corporate Costs and Other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Operating Profit of reportable segments in 2009 was $996.0 million compared to $1,156.8 million in 2008, a decrease of $160.8 million, or 13.9%. 28 Table of Contents The change in Segment Operating Profit of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Segment Operating Profit 2008 $ 1,156.8 Net effect of price and mix $ 377.0 Decreased sales volume (280.2 ) Effects of changing foreign currency rates (35.1 ) Manufacturing and delivery (205.5 ) Operating expenses 4.4 Other (21.4 ) Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit (160.8 ) Segment Operating Profit 2009 $ 996.0 Interest Expense Interest expense in 2009 was $221.7 million compared with interest expense of $253.0 million in 2008. The 2009 amount includes $5.2 million of additional interest charges for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees, net of a gain from the termination of interest rate swap agreements following the May tender for the 7.50% Senior Debentures due May 2010. Exclusive of these items, interest expense decreased approximately $36.5 million. The decrease is principally due to lower variable interest rates under the Companys bank credit agreement as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Income Interest income for 2009 was $28.6 million compared to $38.6 million for 2008. The decrease is principally due to lower interest rates on investments, which more than offset the additional interest earned on the Companys higher cash balance. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2009 was 39.2%, compared with 42.4% for 2008. The provision for 2009 includes a non cash tax benefit transferred from other comprehensive income of $47.9 million (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). The provision for 2008 includes a net expense of $33.3 million related to tax legislation, restructuring, and other. Excluding these items and the effects in both periods of pretax items for which taxes are separately calculated and recorded in the period, the Companys effective tax rate for 2009 was 26.5% compared to 24.0% for 2008. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2009 was due to lower earnings generated in jurisdictions where the Company has lower effective tax rates. The Company expects that the effective tax rate will not change significantly in 2010 compared to 2009. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2009 were $36.0 million compared to $70.2 million for 2008. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests were reduced by $9.2 million in 2009 related to restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded during the year. Excluding this amount, net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2009 decreased $25.0 million compared with 2008. The decrease is primarily a result of lower segment operating profit in the Companys South American segment in 2009. 29 Table of Contents Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to the Company For 2009, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $161.8 million compared to $251.5 million for 2008. The after tax effects of the items excluded from Segment Operating Profit, the 2009 additional interest charges, and the 2009 and 2008 unusual tax items increased or decreased earnings in 2009 and 2008 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2009 2008 Net expense related to tax legislation, restructuring, and other $ $ (34.8 ) Non cash tax benefit transferred from other comprehensive income 47.9 Restructuring and asset impairment (182.8 ) (110.1 ) Charge for Venezuela currency remeasurement (17.6 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees, net of interestrate swap gain (5.2 ) Increase in the accrual for future asbestos related costs (180.0 ) (248.8 ) Total $ (337.7 ) $ (393.7 ) Executive Overview Years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 Net sales from continuing operations were $318.0 million higher than the prior year principally resulting from improved pricing and favorable product mix across all regions, as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates, principally the Euro. Lower unit shipments partially offset these favorable increases. Segment Operating Profit for reportable segments was $49.8 million higher than the prior year. The benefits of higher selling prices, improved product mix, improvements in glass plant operating efficiencies, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates were partially offset by inflationary cost increases in manufacturing and delivery costs and lower sales volume. Interest expense in 2008 was $253.0 million compared with interest expense from continuing operations of $348.6 million in 2007. Included in the 2007 interest expense was $9.5 million for both note repurchase premiums and the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the November 2007 repurchase of the $625.0 million 8.75% Senior Secured Notes. Exclusive of these items, interest expense decreased approximately $86.1 million. The decrease is principally due to lower variable interest rates under the Companys bank credit agreement and on long term debt variable and swapped rates as well as lower overall debt levels, partially offset by an increase in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease is also due to the non recurrence of interest on debt that was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2007 with the proceeds from the plastics sale. This interest was previously allocated to discontinued operations until the date of the sale. Interest income for continuing operations for 2008 was $38.6 million compared to $42.3 million for 2007. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company for 2008 were $251.5 million, or $1.48 per share (diluted), compared to earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $299.3 million, or $1.78 per share (diluted) for 2007. Earnings in both periods included items that management considered not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased net earnings in 30 Table of Contents 2008 by $393.7 million, or $2.32 per share, and decreased net earnings in 2007 by $194.4 million, or $1.16 per share. Cash payments for asbestos related costs were $210.2 million for 2008 compared to $347.1 million for 2007. The decrease is due to reduced funding for settlements of certain claims on an accelerated basis. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment for continuing operations was $361.7 million for 2008 compared to $292.5 million for 2007. The 2008 amount is in a range consistent with long term historical levels. The increase is also due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Results of Operations Comparison of 2008 with 2007 Net Sales The Companys net sales in 2008 were $7,884.7 million compared with $7,566.7 million in 2007, an increase of $318.0 million, or 4.2%. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The change in net sales can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Net sales 2007 $ 7,475.0 Net effect of price and mix $ 572.0 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 274.5 Decreased sales volume (514.0 ) Total effect on net sales 332.5 Net sales 2008 $ 7,807.5 Segment Operating Profit Operating Profit of the reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments operations are included in Retained Corporate Costs and Other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Operating Profit of reportable segments in 2008 was $1,156.8 million compared to $1,107.0 million in 2007, an increase of $49.8 million, or 4.5%. 31 Table of Contents The change in Segment Operating Profit of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Segment Operating Profit 2007 $ 1,107.0 Net effect of price and mix $ 572.0 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 56.0 Manufacturing and delivery costs (468.0 ) Decreased sales volume (116.0 ) Operating expense (28.0 ) Other 33.8 Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit 49.8 Segment Operating Profit 2008 $ 1,156.8 Interest Expense Interest expense in 2008 was $253.0 million compared with interest expense from continuing operations of $348.6 million in 2007. Included in the 2007 interest expense was $9.5 million for both note repurchase premiums and the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the November 2007 repurchase of the $625.0 million 8.75% Senior Secured Notes. Exclusive of these items, interest expense decreased approximately $86.1 million. The decrease is principally due to lower variable interest rates under the Companys bank credit agreement and on long term debt variable and swapped rates as well as lower overall debt levels, partially offset by an increase in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease is also due to the non recurrence of interest on debt that was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2007 with the proceeds from the plastics sale. This interest was previously allocated to discontinued operations until the date of the sale. Interest Income Interest income for continuing operations for 2008 was $38.6 million compared to $42.3 million for 2007. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2008 was 42.4%, compared with 29.2% for 2007. The provision for 2008 includes a net expense of $33.3 million related to tax legislation, restructuring, and other. The provision for 2007 includes a benefit of $13.5 million for the recognition of tax credits related to restructuring of investments in certain European operations. Excluding those items and the effects in both periods of pretax items for which taxes are separately calculated and recorded in the period, the Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2008 was 24.0% compared to 24.4% for 2007. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2008 were $70.2 million compared to $59.7 million for 2007. The increase was primarily attributed to higher earnings from the Companys operations in South America. 32 Table of Contents Earnings from Continuing Operations For 2008, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $251.5 million compared to $299.3 million for 2007. The after tax effects of the items excluded from Segment Operating Profit, the 2008 and 2007 international net tax benefits, and the 2007 additional interest charges, increased or decreased earnings in 2008 and 2007 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2008 2007 Net expense related to tax legislation, restructuring, and other $ (34.8 ) $ Gain recognition from foreign tax credits 13.5 Restructuring and asset impairments (110.1 ) (84.1 ) Increase in accrual for future asbestos related costs (248.8 ) (115.0 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees (8.8 ) Total $ (393.7 ) $ (194.4 ) Items Excluded from Reportable Segment Totals Retained Corporate Costs and Other Retained corporate costs and other for 2009 were $66.7 million compared with $0.7 million for 2008. The increased expense in 2009 is mainly attributable to increased employee benefit costs, primarily pension expense, and lower royalty income. Retained corporate costs and other for 2008 were $0.7 million compared with $78.8 million for 2007. Beginning in 2008, the Company revised its method of allocating corporate expenses. The Company decreased slightly the percentage allocation based on sales and significantly expanded the number of functions included in the allocation based on cost of services. It is not practicable to quantify the net effect of these changes on periods prior to 2008. However, the effect for 2008 was to reduce the amount of retained corporate costs by approximately $38.0 million. Also contributing to the decrease were lower accruals for self insured risks and increased pension income in 2008. Restructuring and Asset Impairments During 2009, the Company recorded charges totaling $213.6 million ($182.8 million after tax amount attributable to the Company), for restructuring, asset impairment and settlement of pension liabilities in Europe, North America and South America. The charges reflect the additional decisions reached in the Companys strategic review of its global manufacturing footprint. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Charges for similar actions during 2008 totaled $132.4 million ($109.2 million after tax amount attributable to the Company). See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 33 Table of Contents During 2008, the Company also recorded an additional $0.9 million (pretax and after tax amount attributable to the Company), related to the impairment of the Companys equity investment in the South American Segments 50% owned Caribbean affiliate. During 2007, the Company recorded charges totaling $100.3 million ($84.1 million after tax amount attributable to the Company), for restructuring and asset impairment in South America, Europe, and North America. The charges reflect the initial decisions of the Companys strategic global manufacturing footprint review. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Charge for Venezuela Currency Remeasurement Due to Venezuelan government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country, the Company used the parallel market rate to translate the balance sheets of its Venezuelan subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009. The impact of this change in exchange rates was an approximate 60% reduction in the U.S. dollar reported amounts for all assets and liabilities of the Companys Venezuelan subsidiaries, and a resulting $132.5 million charge recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income and $45.9 million charge recorded against noncontrolling interests. In addition, the Company remeasured certain bolivar denominated assets and liabilities held outside of Venezuela to the parallel market rate and recorded a charge of $17.3 million ($17.6 million after tax amount attributable to the Company) in 2009. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Charge for Asbestos Related Costs The fourth quarter of 2009 charge for asbestos related costs was $180.0 million (pretax and after tax), compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 charge of $250.0 million ($248.8 million after tax). These charges resulted from the Companys comprehensive annual review of asbestos related liabilities and costs. In each year, the Company concluded that an increase in the accrued liability was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims pending and expected to be filed during the several years following the completion of the comprehensive review. See Critical Accounting Estimates for further information. The lower 2009 asbestos charge reflected, in part, the lower level of pending asbestos related lawsuits at December 31, 2009 compared to the prior year. Asbestos related cash payments for 2009 were $190.3 million, a decrease of $19.9 million from 2008. Deferred amounts payable were approximately $36.3 million and $34.0 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the Company received approximately 6,000 new filings and disposed of approximately 10,000 claims. As of December 31, 2009, the number of asbestos related claims pending against the Company was approximately 7,000. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet all asbestos related obligations on a short term and long term basis. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Discontinued Operations On July 31, 2007, the Company completed the sale of its plastics packaging business to Rexam PLC for approximately $1.825 billion in cash. The Company has presented the results of operations for the plastics packaging business in the Consolidated Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 as discontinued operations. Interest expense was allocated to the discontinued operations based on 34 Table of Contents debt that was required by an amendment to the Secured Credit Agreement to be repaid from the net proceeds. Amounts for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. The following summarizes the revenues and expenses of the discontinued operations as reported in the consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated: Year ended December 31, 2007 Net sales $ 455.0 Manufacturing, shipping and delivery (343.5 ) Gross profit 111.5 Selling and administrative (20.7 ) Research, development and engineering (8.3 ) Interest expense (80.6 ) Other income (0.1 ) Other expense (1.2 ) Earnings before income taxes 0.6 Credit for income taxes 2.4 Earnings from discontinued operations 3.0 Gain on sale of discontinued operations 1,038.5 Net earnings from discontinued operations 1,041.5 Net earnings from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.2 ) Net earnings from discontinued operations attributable to the Company $ 1,041.3 The 2007 gain on the sale of discontinued operations of $1,038.5 million includes charges totaling $62.1 million for debt retirement costs, consisting principally of redemption premiums and write off of unamortized fees, and a gain of $8.7 million for curtailment and settlement of pension and other postretirement benefits. The gain also includes a net provision for income taxes of $38.2 million, consisting of taxes on the gain of $445.0 million that are substantially offset by a credit of $406.8 million for the reversal of valuation allowances against existing tax loss carryforwards. The sale agreement provides for an adjustment of the selling price based on working capital levels and certain other factors. The gain on sale of discontinued operations of $6.8 million reported in 2008 relates to an adjustment of the 2007 gain on the sale of the plastics packaging business mainly related to finalizing certain tax allocations and an adjustment to the selling price in accordance with procedures set forth in the final contract. Capital Resources and Liquidity Current and Long Term Debt The Companys total debt at December 31, 2009 was $3.61 billion, compared to $3.33 billion at December 31, 2008. 35 Table of Contents On June 14, 2006, the Companys subsidiary borrowers entered into the Secured Credit Agreement (the Agreement). At December 31, 2009, the Agreement included a $900.0 million revolving credit facility, a 160.0 million Australian dollar term loan, and a 110.8 million Canadian dollar term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of June 15, 2012. It also included a $189.5 million term loan and a 189.5 million term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of June 14, 2013. During December 2009, the Companys subsidiary borrowers repaid 65.0 million Australian dollars, $2.0 million and 2.0 million of term loans under the Agreement. As a result of the 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and several of its subsidiaries, the Company believes that the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility was reduced by $32.3 million. After further deducting amounts attributable to letters of credit and overdraft facilities that are supported by the revolving credit facility, at December 31, 2009 the Companys subsidiary borrowers had unused credit of $760.0 million available under the Agreement. The Agreement contains various covenants that restrict, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur certain liens, make certain investments and acquisitions, become liable under contingent obligations in certain defined instances only, make restricted junior payments, make certain asset sales within guidelines and limits, make capital expenditures beyond a certain threshold, engage in material transactions with shareholders and affiliates, participate in sale and leaseback financing arrangements, alter its fundamental business, amend certain outstanding debt obligations, and prepay certain outstanding debt obligations. The Agreement also contains one financial maintenance covenant, a Leverage Ratio, that requires the Company not to exceed a ratio calculated by dividing consolidated total debt, less cash and cash equivalents, by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Agreement. The Leverage Ratio could restrict the ability of the Company to undertake additional financing to the extent that such financing would cause the Leverage Ratio to exceed the specified maximum. Failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default under the Agreement. In such an event, the Company could not request borrowings under the revolving facility, and all amounts outstanding under the Agreement, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. If an event of default occurs under the Agreement and the lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Agreement to become due and payable, this would result in a default under a number of other outstanding debt securities and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to these debt securities. A default or event of default under the Agreement, indentures or agreements governing other indebtedness could also lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions. The Leverage Ratio also determines pricing under the Agreement. The interest rate on borrowings under the Agreement is, at the Companys option, the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Agreement. These rates include a margin linked to the Leverage Ratio and the borrowers senior secured debt rating. The margins range from 0.875% to 1.75% for Eurocurrency Rate loans and from 0.125% to 0.75% for Base Rate loans. In addition, a facility fee is payable on the revolving credit facility commitments ranging from 0.20% to 0.50% per annum linked to the Leverage Ratio. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Agreement at December 31, 2009 was 2.40%. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and restrictions in the Agreement. In addition, the Company believes that it will remain in compliance and that its ability to borrow funds under the Agreement will not be adversely affected by the covenants and restrictions. During the second quarter of 2008, the Company used cash from operations and borrowings under the Agreement to retire $250 million principal amount of 7.35% Senior Notes which matured in May 2008. 36 Table of Contents During May 2009, a subsidiary of the Company issued senior notes with a face value of $600.0 million at 96.72% of face value for an effective interest rate of 8.00%. The notes bear interest at 7.375% and are due May 15, 2016. The notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries. The net proceeds, after deducting commissions and expenses from the notes, approximated $568 million and were used to purchase in a tender offer $221.9 million of the $250 million principal amount of 7.50% Senior Debentures due May 2010 and to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The balance of the proceeds increased cash. As a part of the issuance of these notes and the related tender offer, the Company recorded additional interest charges in 2009 of $5.2 million for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees, net of a gain from the termination of interest rate swap agreements related to the notes. During October 2006, the Company entered into a European accounts receivable securitization program, which had a limit of 250 million at December 31, 2009. The program extends through October 2011, subject to annual renewal of backup credit lines. In addition, the Company participates in a receivables financing program in the Asia Pacific region with a revolving funding commitment of 89 million Australian dollars and 10 million New Zealand dollars that expire February 2010 and November 2010, respectively. Information related to the Companys accounts receivable securitization program as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 is as follows: 2009 2008 Balance (included in short term loans) $ 289.0 $ 293.7 Weighted average interest rate 2.52 % 5.31 % Cash Flows For 2009, cash provided by continuing operating activities was $800.0 million compared with $757.2 million for 2008. The increase is mainly attributable to lower working capital balances, lower interest payments, and lower payments for asbestos related costs, partially offset by lower net earnings, increased payments for restructuring activities, and increased pension contributions. Cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected by payments for restructuring activities in 2010. Asbestos related payments for 2009 decreased $19.9 million to $190.3 million, compared with $210.2 million for 2008. During 2009, the Company contributed $123.1 million, including $49.5 million of accelerated 2010 contributions, to its non U.S. defined benefit pension plans, compared with $61.2 million in 2008. The Company was not required to make cash contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans during 2009. Contributions in 2010 are dependent on future asset returns and discount rates which the Company is unable to predict. However, the Company believes that contributions to its non U.S. plans will be lower in 2010, due to the accelerated contributions made in 2009, and that it will not be required to make contributions to its U.S. plans in 2010. Depending on a number of factors, the Company may elect to contribute amounts in excess of minimum required amounts in order to improve the funded status of certain plans. 37 Table of Contents Capital spending for property, plant and equipment was $427.6 million compared with $361.7 million in the prior year. The Company capitalized $16.8 million and $25.6 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, under capital lease obligations with the related financing recorded as long term debt. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $811.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. The increase over the December 31, 2008 balance of $379.5 million largely represents cash provided by operating activities of $800.0 million for 2009 and additional funds provided by the May 2009 financing activities described above, partially offset by capital spending of $427.6 million and term loan repayments of $63.4 million. Most of the cash is held in mature, liquid markets where the Company has operations, such as North America, Europe and Australia and is readily available to fund global liquidity requirements. Approximately 7% of the cash at December 31, 2009 is held in Venezuela where government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country limit the Companys ability to immediately access cash at the governments official exchange rate of 2.15 bolivars to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2009. The Company has been able to obtain U.S. dollars at the official rate to pay for some of its key raw materials and other imports. However, in 2009, the Venezuelan government significantly slowed the process of exchanging bolivars to U.S. dollars at the official rate. As a result, the Companys cash balance in Venezuela increased as earnings accumulated. The Company has the ability to access the cash in Venezuela more quickly through a market driven parallel exchange process which, at December 31, 2009, valued the bolivar about 60% lower than the official exchange rate. During 2009, the Company entered into a series of parallel market transactions in order to exchange Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars, and recognized foreign currency exchange losses of $28.0 million ($19.5 million after tax amount attributable to the Company). As of December 31, 2009, the Company translated the balance sheets of its Venezuelan subsidiaries at the parallel market rate, which resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $101.5 million. For further information regarding Venezuela, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company anticipates that cash flows from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs, debt service and other obligations on a short term (twelve months) and long term basis. Based on the Companys expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the Companys expected operating cash flow, the Company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Companys liquidity on a short term or long term basis. 38 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following information summarizes the Companys significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2009 (dollars in millions). Payments due by period Total Less than one year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Contractual cash obligations: Long term debt $ 3,231.3 $ 39.6 $ 272.9 $ 1,647.4 $ 1,271.4 Capital lease obligations 75.9 10.1 28.6 21.3 15.9 Operating leases 199.0 60.8 77.8 36.8 23.6 Interest (1) 1,096.5 212.2 399.0 333.5 151.8 Purchase obligations (2) 898.8 517.0 310.0 68.8 3.0 Pension benefit plan contributions 15.0 15.0 Postretirement benefit plan benefit payments (1) 289.0 22.3 44.5 44.1 178.1 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,805.5 $ 877.0 $ 1,132.8 $ 2,151.9 $ 1,643.8 Amount of commitment expiration per period Total Less than one year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Other commercial commitments: Standby letters of credit $ 107.7 $ 107.7 Total commercial commitments $ 107.7 $ 107.7 (1) Amounts based on rates and assumptions at December 31, 2009. (2) The Companys purchase obligations consist principally of contracted amounts for energy and molds. In cases where variable prices are involved, current market prices have been used. The amount above does not include ordinary course of business purchase orders because the majority of such purchase orders may be canceled. The Company does not believe such purchase orders will adversely affect its liquidity position. The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement with taxing authorities may occur for its unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at 39 Table of Contents the time the financial statements are issued. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, estimates and assumptions are discussed within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where estimates and assumptions affect the Companys reported and expected financial results. The Company believes that accounting for property, plant and equipment, impairment of long lived assets, pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, and income taxes involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Property, Plant and Equipment The net carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) at December 31, 2009 totaled $2,742.3 million, representing 31% of total assets. Depreciation expense during 2009 totaled $374.8 million, representing approximately 5% of total costs and expenses. Given the significance of PP&E and associated depreciation to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the determinations of an assets cost basis and its economic useful life are considered to be critical accounting estimates. Cost Basis PP&E is recorded at cost, which is generally objectively quantifiable when assets are purchased singly. However, when assets are purchased in groups, or as part of a business, costs assigned to PP&E are based on an estimate of fair value of each asset at the date of acquisition. These estimates are based on assumptions about asset condition, remaining useful life and market conditions, among others. The Company frequently employs expert appraisers to aid in allocating cost among assets purchased as a group. Included in the cost basis of PP&E are those costs which substantially increase the useful lives or capacity of existing PP&E. Significant judgment is needed to determine which costs should be capitalized under these criteria and which costs should be expensed as a repair or maintenance expenditure. For example, the Company frequently incurs various costs related to its existing glass melting furnaces and forming machines and must make a determination of which costs, if any, to capitalize. The Company relies on the experience and expertise of its operations and engineering staff to make reasonable and consistent judgments regarding increases in useful lives or capacity of PP&E. Estimated Useful Life PP&E is generally depreciated using the straight line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings each period over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by the Company, which may be less than its physical life. Managements assumptions regarding the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, product and process obsolescence, technical standards, and changes in market demand. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, technological advances, excessive wear and tear, or changes in customers requirements may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, the Company depreciates the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Changes in economic useful life assumptions did not have a material impact on the Companys reported results in 2009, 2008 or 2007. 40 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived Assets Property, Plant, and Equipment The Company tests for impairment of PP&E whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. PP&E held for use in the Companys business is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which cash flows can reasonably be identified, typically a geographic region. The Company evaluates the recoverability of property, plant, and equipment based on undiscounted projected cash flows, excluding interest and taxes. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset groups carrying amount exceeds its fair value. PP&E held for sale is reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Impairment testing requires estimation of the fair value of PP&E based on the discounted value of projected future cash flows generated by the asset group. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent managements best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include, among other things: industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, production costs and inflation. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. The Company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. In mid 2007, the Company began a strategic review of its global manufacturing footprint. As a result of this review, during 2007, 2008, and 2009, the Company recorded charges that included impairments of property, plant, and equipment across all segments including certain Retained Corporate Costs and Other activities. While the Company has concluded this strategic review of its manufacturing footprint, it is possible that the Company may conclude in the future that it will close or temporarily idle additional selected facilities or production lines and reduce headcount to increase operating performance and cash flows. As of December 31, 2009, no other decisions had been made and no events had occurred that would require an additional evaluation of possible impairment. For additional information on charges recorded in 2009, 2008 and 2007, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill Goodwill at December 31, 2009 totaled $2,381.0 million, representing 27% of total assets. The Company evaluates goodwill annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. The Company conducts its evaluation as of October 1 of each year. Goodwill impairment testing is performed using the business enterprise value (BEV) of each reporting unit which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free, after tax projected future cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer. This BEV is then compared to the book value of each reporting unit as of the measurement date to assess whether an impairment of goodwill may exist. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company completed its annual testing and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. The testing performed as of October 1, 2009, indicated a significant excess of BEV over book value for each unit. If the Companys projected future cash flows were substantially lower, or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital was substantially higher, the testing performed as of October 1, 2009, may have indicated an impairment of one or more of the Companys reporting units and, as a result, the related goodwill may also have been impaired. However, less significant changes in projected future cash flows or the assumed weighted average cost of capital would not have indicated an impairment. For example, if projected future cash flows had been decreased by 5%, or if the weighted average cost of capital had been increased by 5%, or both, the resulting lower BEVs would still have exceeded the book value of each reporting unit by a significant margin. 41 Table of Contents The Company will monitor conditions throughout 2010 that might significantly affect the projections and variables used in the impairment test to determine if a review prior to October 1 may be appropriate. If the results of impairment testing confirm that a write down of goodwill is necessary, then the Company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of 2010, or earlier if appropriate. In the event the Company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill, the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth. Other Long Lived Assets Other long lived assets include, among others, equity investments and repair parts inventories. The Companys equity investments are non publicly traded ventures with other companies in businesses related to those of the Company. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2007 and 2008, the Company recorded charges that included impairments of an equity investment. For additional information on these charges, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company carries a significant amount of repair parts inventories in order to provide a dependable supply of quality parts for servicing the Companys PP&E, particularly its glass melting furnaces and forming machines. The Company evaluates the recoverability of repair parts inventories based on undiscounted projected cash flows, excluding interest and taxes, when factors indicate that impairment may exist. If impairment exists, the repair parts are written down to fair value. The Company continually monitors the carrying value of repair parts for recoverability, especially in light of changing business circumstances. For example, technological advances related to, and changes in, the estimated future demand for products produced on the equipment to which the repair parts relate may make the repair parts obsolete. In these circumstances, the Company writes down the repair parts to fair value. Pension Benefit Plans Significant Estimates The determination of pension obligations and the related pension expense or credits to operations involves significant estimates. The most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The Company uses discount rates based on yields of high quality fixed rate debt securities at the end of the year. At December 31, 2009, the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 5.76%. The Company uses an expected long term rate of return on assets that is based on both past performance of the various plans assets and estimated future performance of the assets. Due to the nature of the plans assets and the volatility of debt and equity markets, actual returns may vary significantly from year to year. The Company refers to average historical returns over longer periods (up to 10 years) in determining its expected rates of return because short term fluctuations in market values do not reflect the rates of return the Company expects to achieve based upon its long term investing strategy. For purposes of determining pension charges and credits in 2010, the Companys estimated weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.6% compared to 7.6% in 2009. The Company recorded pension expense (income) from continuing operations of $41.3 million, $(24.3) million, and $3.4 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, from its principal defined benefit pension plans. Pension expense for 2009 included a charge of $9.3 million for the settlement of pension liabilities related to previously closed facilities and $8.6 million for special termination benefits related to announced plant closures. The increase in pension expense in 2009 is principally a result of lower asset values in the U.S. plans at the beginning of 2009. Depending on currency translation rates, the Company expects to record approximately $75 million of pension expense for the full year of 2010. 42 Table of Contents Future effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance. For example, a one half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding the expected return on assets would result in a change of approximately $18 million in the pretax pension amount for the full year 2010. In addition, changes in external factors, including the fair values of plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities, could have a significant effect on the recognition of funded status as described below. Recognition of Funded Status General accounting principles for pension benefit plans require employers to adjust the assets and liabilities related to defined benefit plans so that the amounts reflected on the balance sheet represent the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans. These funded status amounts are measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and actuarially calculated benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2009, the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss component of share owners equity was decreased by $133.5 million ($119.1 million after tax attributable to non U.S. pension plans) to reflect a net increase in the funded status of the Companys plans at that date. Contingencies and Litigation The Company believes that its ultimate asbestos related liability (i.e., its indemnity payments or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees) cannot reasonably be estimated. The Companys ability reasonably to estimate its liability has been significantly affected by the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the United States, the inherent uncertainty of future disease incidence and claiming patterns, the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation and found liable for substantial damage awards, the use of mass litigation screenings to generate new lawsuits, the large number of claims asserted or filed by parties who claim prior exposure to asbestos materials but have no present physical impairment as a result of such exposure, and the significant number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy. The Company continues to monitor trends that may affect its ultimate liability and continues to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the Company. The Company conducts a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs annually in connection with finalizing and reporting its annual results of operations, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review. If the results of an annual comprehensive review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is insufficient to cover its estimated future asbestos related costs, then the Company will record an appropriate charge to increase the accrued liability. The Company believes that a reasonable estimation of the probable amount of the liability for claims not yet asserted against the Company is not possible beyond a period of several years. Therefore, while the results of future annual comprehensive reviews cannot be determined, the Company expects the addition of one year to the estimation period will result in an annual charge. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a charge of $180.0 million (pretax and after tax) to increase its accrued liability for asbestos related costs. This amount was lower than the 2008 charge of $250.0 million. The factors and developments that particularly affected the determination of the amount of this increase in the accrual included the following: (i) the rates and average disposition costs of filings against the Company; (ii) the continuing evidence of irregularities associated with mass litigation screenings; (iii) the Companys successful litigation record; (iv) legislative developments and court rulings in several states; and (v) the impact these and other factors had on the Companys valuation of existing and future claims. The Companys estimates are based on a number of factors as described further in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 Table of Contents Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes as required by general accounting principles under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates. Management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. In addition, judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of uncertain income tax positions. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. During 2009, the Companys estimated unrecognized tax benefits increased by $16.0 million related to tax positions taken in prior years in non U.S. jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is dependent upon projected profitability including the effects of tax planning. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which the Company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses. In the U.S., the Company has recorded significant deferred tax assets, the largest of which relate to foreign and other tax credits which amounted to $329.7 million at December 31, 2009, the accrued liability for asbestos related costs which amounted to $169.8 million at December 31, 2009 that are not deductible until paid and the pension liability which amounted to $82.0 million at December 31, 2009. The deferred tax assets are partially offset by deferred tax liabilities, the most significant of which relate to accelerated depreciation. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of U.S. deferred tax assets not offset by deferred tax liabilities. ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates, and changes in commodity prices, principally energy and soda ash. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating energy prices. These instruments carry varying degrees of counterparty credit risk. To mitigate this risk, the Company has established limits on the exposure with individual counterparties and the Company regularly monitors these exposures. Substantially all of these exposures are with counterparties that are rated single A or above. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Earnings of operations outside the United States A substantial portion of the Companys operations are conducted by subsidiaries outside the U.S. The primary international markets served by the Companys subsidiaries are in Canada, Australia, China, South America (principally Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela), and Europe (principally Italy, France, The Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Poland). In general, revenues earned and costs incurred by the Companys major international operations are denominated in their respective local currencies. Consequently, the Companys reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the international markets in which the Companys subsidiaries operate. When the U.S. 44 Table of Contents dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the reported U.S. dollar value of local currency earnings generally decreases; when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the reported U.S. dollar value of local currency earnings generally increases. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company did not have any significant foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was the U.S. dollar. However, beginning January 1, 2010, the Companys subsidiaries in Venezuela will be considered to be operating in a highly inflationary economy and the Company will be required to adopt the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for its subsidiaries in that country. The Company does not hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to earnings of operations outside the United States. In Venezuela, where currency restrictions have been in effect for a number of years, the government controls all exchanges of bolivars into U.S. dollars at the official rate, which, as of December 31, 2009, had remained fixed at 2.15 bolivars to the U.S dollar since early 2005. In 2009, increased restrictions in the currency exchange process, combined with a general decline in economic conditions in Venezuela, contributed to a growing shortage of U.S. dollars available for exchange at the official rate. In addition, inflation in Venezuela has continued at an accelerated rate, and, beginning January 1, 2010, Venezuelas economy will be considered highly inflationary. For accounting purposes, an economy is deemed to be highly inflationary when the three year cumulative rate of inflation exceeds 100%. Due to currency restrictions in place in Venezuela, the Company adopted the market driven parallel exchange rate as of December 31, 2009 for translation purposes, and expects to use the parallel market rate to remeasure its financial statements under a highly inflationary basis of accounting. This will have an adverse impact on the reported results of the Companys Venezuelan operations, which represented approximately 40% of the South American Segments operating profit for 2009, including the $28.0 million foreign exchange losses recognized in 2009 to exchange bolivars into U.S. dollars in the parallel market. In addition, monetary assets (such as cash and receivables) and monetary liabilities (such as payables and accruals) will be remeasured at the end of each reporting period using the parallel market rate at that date. Because the parallel market rate is subject to fluctuation, such remeasurement will increase the volatility of reported results of operations. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Borrowings not denominated in the functional currency Because the Companys subsidiaries operate within their local economic environment, the Company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with borrowings denominated in the local currency to the extent practicable where debt financing is desirable or necessary. Considerations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans, tax implications, and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms. In those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency, this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. In those countries where the U.S. dollar is the designated functional currency, however, local currency borrowings expose the Company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. Available excess funds of a subsidiary may be redeployed through intercompany loans to other subsidiaries for debt repayment, capital investment, or other cash requirements. Generally, each intercompany loan is denominated in the lenders local currency giving rise to foreign currency exchange rate risk for the borrower. To mitigate this risk, the borrower generally enters into a forward exchange contract which effectively swaps the intercompany loan and related interest to its local currency. The Company believes the near term exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk of its foreign currency risk sensitive instruments was not material at December 31, 2009 and 2008. 45 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates applicable to its U.S. dollar indebtedness. The Companys interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on net income and cash flow, while minimizing interest payments and expense. To achieve this objective, the Company regularly evaluates its mix of fixed and floating rate debt, and, from time to time, may enter into interest rate swap agreements. The following table provides information about the Companys interest rate sensitivity related to its significant debt obligations at December 31, 2009. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date. Fair There Value at (dollars in millions) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 after Total 12/31/2009 Long term debt at variable rate: Principal by expected maturity $ 21.4 $ 136.1 $ 165.4 $ 471.9 $ 11.7 $ 22.2 $ 828.7 $ 828.7 Avg. principal outstanding 818.0 739.3 588.5 269.9 28.1 11.1 Avg. interest rate 2.40 % 2.40 % 2.40 % 2.40 % 2.40 % 2.40 % Long term debt at fixed rate: Principal by expected maturity $ 28.1 $ 450.0 $ 724.7 $ 1,282.9 $ 2,485.7 $ 2,518.5 Avg. principal outstanding 2,468.1 $ 2,457.6 $ 2,457.6 2,176.4 1,282.9 1,282.9 Avg. interest rate 7.33 % 7.30 % 7.30 % 7.11 % 7.35 % 7.35 % The Company believes the near term exposure to interest rate risk of its debt obligations has not changed materially since December 31, 2008. Commodity Price Risk The Company has exposure to commodity price risk, principally related to energy. The Company mitigates a portion of this risk by passing commodity cost changes through to customers. In addition, the Company enters into commodity futures contracts related to forecasted natural gas requirements, the objectives of which are to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid for natural gas and the related volatility in cash flows. The Company continually evaluates the natural gas market with respect to its forecasted usage requirements over the next twelve to twenty four months and periodically enters into commodity futures contracts in order to hedge a portion of its usage requirements over that period. At December 31, 2009, the Company had entered into commodity futures contracts covering approximately 4,800,000 MM BTUs over that period. The Company believes the near term exposure to commodity price risk of its commodity futures contracts was not material at December 31, 2009. 46 Table of Contents Forward Looking Statements This document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. Forward looking statements reflect the Companys current expectations and projections about future events at the time, and thus involve uncertainty and risk. It is possible the Companys future financial performance may differ from expectations due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to the following: (1) foreign currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar, (2) changes in capital availability or cost, including interest rate fluctuations, (3) the general political, economic and competitive conditions in markets and countries where the Company has its operations, including disruptions in capital markets, disruptions in the supply chain, competitive pricing pressures, inflation or deflation, and changes in tax rates and laws, (4) consumer preferences for alternative forms of packaging, (5) fluctuations in raw material and labor costs, (6) availability of raw materials, (7) costs and availability of energy, (8) transportation costs, (9) the ability of the Company to raise selling prices commensurate with energy and other cost increases, (10) consolidation among competitors and customers, (11) the ability of the Company to integrate operations of acquired businesses and achieve expected synergies, (12) unanticipated expenditures with respect to environmental, safety and health laws, (13) the performance by customers of their obligations under purchase agreements, and (14) the timing and occurrence of events which are beyond the control of the Company, including events related to asbestos related claims. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. Any forward looking statements in this document are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Forward looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from expectations. While the Company continually reviews trends and uncertainties affecting the Companys results of operations and financial condition, the Company does not assume any obligation to update or supplement any particular forward looking statements contained in this document.
