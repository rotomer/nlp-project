ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Following are the Companys net sales by segment and segment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 (dollars in millions). The Companys measure of profit for its reportable segments is Segment Operating Profit, which consists of consolidated earnings from continuing operations before interest income, interest expense, and provision for income taxes and excludes amounts related to certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations as well as certain retained corporate costs. The segment data presented below is prepared in accordance with general accounting principles for segment reporting. The line titled reportable segment totals, however, is a non GAAP measure when presented outside of the financial statement footnotes. Management has included reportable segment totals below to facilitate the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. The Companys management uses Segment Operating Profit, in combination with selected cash flow information, to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. 2010 2009 2008 Net Sales: Europe $ 2,746 $ 2,918 $ 3,498 North America 1,879 2,074 2,210 South America 975 689 791 Asia Pacific 996 925 964 Reportable segment totals 6,596 6,606 7,463 Other 37 46 77 Net Sales $ 6,633 $ 6,652 $ 7,540 24 Table of Contents 2010 2009 2008 Segment Operating Profit: Europe $ 324 $ 333 $ 478 North America 275 282 185 South America 224 145 221 Asia Pacific 141 131 163 Reportable segment totals 964 891 1,047 Items excluded from Segment Operating Profit: Retained corporate costs and other (89 ) (67 ) (1 ) Restructuring and asset impairment (13 ) (207 ) (133 ) Acquisition related fair value inventory adjustments and restructuring, transaction and financing costs (32 ) Charge for currency remeasurement (18 ) Charge for asbestos related costs (170 ) (180 ) (250 ) Interest income 13 18 25 Interest expense (249 ) (222 ) (253 ) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 424 215 435 Provision for income taxes (129 ) (83 ) (210 ) Earnings from continuing operations 295 132 225 Earnings from discontinued operations 31 66 96 Gain (loss) on disposal of discontinued operations (331 ) 7 Net earnings (loss) (5 ) 198 328 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (42 ) (36 ) (70 ) Net earnings (loss) attributable to the Company $ (47 ) $ 162 $ 258 Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company $ 258 $ 110 $ 175 Note: all amounts excluded from reportable segment totals are discussed in the following applicable sections. Executive Overview Comparison of 2010 with 2009 2010 Highlights Acquired glass plants in Argentina (1 plant), Brazil (3 plants) and China (3 plants) Invested in a joint venture with glass plants in China, Malaysia and Vietnam Growth in South America, acquisitions in 2010 and improved manufacturing productivity drove 8% increase in Segment Operating Profit Issued $690 million exchangeable senior notes due 2015 and &euro;500 million senior notes due 2020, and redeemed $450 million senior notes due 2013 Repurchased 6 million shares of the Companys common stock for $199 million Reclassified Venezuelan operations as discontinued operations Net sales were $19 million lower than the prior year principally resulting from decreased shipments and the impact of cost pass through provisions on certain customer contracts, partially offset by the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 25 Table of Contents Segment Operating Profit for reportable segments was $73 million higher than the prior year. The increase was mainly attributable to lower manufacturing and delivery costs and the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Interest expense in 2010 was $249 million compared with interest expense of $222 million in 2009. The increase is principally due to additional debt issued in 2010 to fund acquisitions. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company for 2010 were $258 million, or $1.55 per share (diluted), compared to $110 million, or $0.65 per share (diluted) for 2009. Earnings in both periods included items that management considered not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased net earnings in 2010 by $176 million, or $1.05 per share, and decreased net earnings in 2009 by $334 million, or $1.96 per share. The Company purchased 6 million shares of its common stock in 2010, which increased earnings per share by approximately $0.05 for 2010. The Companys Venezuelan operations were expropriated by the Venezuelan government in 2010. The Company has reclassified its Venezuelan operations to discontinued operations for all periods presented. In addition, the Company recognized a loss on the disposal of its Venezuelan operations as the net assets of the operations were written off. The type or amount of compensation the Company may receive from the Venezuelan government is uncertain and thus, will be recorded as a gain from discontinued operations when received. 2010 was a transition year for the Company. The Company concluded the strategic review of its global profitability and manufacturing footprint that began in 2007, and shifted its focus to profitable growth in emerging markets, which was highlighted by the acquisitions in 2010. Results of Operations Comparison of 2010 with 2009 Net Sales The Companys net sales in 2010 were $6,633 million compared with $6,652 million in 2009, a decrease of $19 million, or 0.3%. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decline in net sales in 2010 was due to lower glass container shipments and the impact of cost pass through provisions on certain customer contracts, partially offset by the favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Glass container shipments, in tonnes, were down 1.0% in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to lower beer glass volumes in North America and Europe. The Companys beer markets remain weak in North America and Europe due to continued weakness in the economy and high unemployment levels. In addition, North American beer volumes were impacted by the loss of certain beer contracts resulting from business renegotiated at the end of 2009 in order for the Company to achieve its margin objectives. Sales volumes in 2010 also benefited from the acquisitions in Brazil and Argentina, as well as organic growth in South America where glass container shipments, excluding the acquisitions, increased approximately 20% compared to 2009. The cost pass through provisions include monthly or quarterly contractual provisions as well as the transfer of certain third party costs, such as shipping, to customers, primarily in North America. Foreign currency exchange rate changes increased net sales in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a stronger Australian dollar, Brazilian Real and Colombian Peso in relation to the U.S. dollar, partly offset by a weaker Euro. 26 Table of Contents The change in net sales of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Net sales 2009 $ 6,606 Net effect of price and mix $ 5 Customer pass through provisions (30 ) Sales volume (61 ) Effects of changing foreign currency rates 76 Total effect on net sales (10 ) Net sales 2010 $ 6,596 Segment Operating Profit Operating Profit of the reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments operations are included in Retained Corporate Costs and Other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Operating Profit of reportable segments in 2010 was $964 million compared to $891 million in 2009, an increase of $73 million, or 8.2%. The net effect of price and product mix in 2010 was consistent with 2009. Sales volume had a minimal impact on Segment Operating Profit in 2010 as the decrease in glass container shipments during the year was more than offset by favorable regional sales mix, primarily due to growth of higher margin business in South America. Manufacturing and delivery costs declined $38 million from 2009 mostly due to benefits from the Companys strategic footprint alignment initiative, partially offset by $20 million of inflationary cost increases. Foreign currency exchange rate changes increased Segment Operating Profit in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a stronger Australian dollar, Brazilian Real and Colombian Peso in relation to the U.S. dollar, partly offset by a weaker Euro. The change in Segment Operating Profit of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Segment Operating Profit 2009 $ 891 Net effect of price and mix $ 5 Sales volume 7 Manufacturing and delivery 38 Operating expenses and other 7 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 16 Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit 73 Segment Operating Profit 2010 $ 964 Interest Expense Interest expense in 2010 was $249 million compared with interest expense of $222 million in 2009. The 2009 amount includes $5 million of additional interest charges for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees, net of a gain from the termination of interest rate swap agreements following the May 2009 tender for the 7.50% Senior Debentures due May 2010. Exclusive of these items, interest expense increased approximately $32 million. The increase is principally due to additional debt issued in 2010 to fund acquisitions. 27 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income for 2010 was $13 million compared to $18 million for 2009. The decrease is principally due to lower interest rates on the Companys cash and investments. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2010 was 30.4%, compared with 38.6% for 2009. The provision for 2010 includes a tax benefit of $24 million related to the reversal of a non U.S. valuation allowance offset by additional liability related to uncertain tax positions. The provisions for 2010 and 2009 include a continuing operation non cash tax benefit transferred from other income categories of $8 million and $48 million, respectively (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). Excluding the amounts related to items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations, the Companys effective tax rate for 2010 was 26.2% compared to 24.0% for 2009. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2010 was due to higher earnings generated in jurisdictions where the Company has higher effective tax rates. The Company expects that the effective tax rate will not change significantly in 2011 compared to 2010. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2010 was $42 million compared to $36 million for 2009. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests was $37 million in 2010 compared to $22 million in 2009. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests was reduced by $8 million in 2009 related to restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded during the year. Excluding this amount, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2010 increased $7 million compared with 2009. This increase is primarily a result of higher segment operating profit in the Companys South American segment in 2010. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests related to discontinued operations in 2010 was $5 million compared to $14 million in 2009. The decrease is due to 2010 only including a partial year of earnings from the Companys Venezuelan operations due to the expropriation in October 2010 and the unfavorable effects of the bolivar devaluation in 2010 compared to 2009. Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to the Company For 2010, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $258 million compared to $110 million for 2009. The after tax effects of the items excluded from 28 Table of Contents Segment Operating Profit, the unusual tax items and the 2009 additional interest charges increased or decreased earnings in 2010 and 2009 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2010 2009 Restructuring and asset impairment $ (11 ) $ (180 ) Acquisition related fair value inventory adjustments and restructuring, transaction and financing costs (27 ) Charge for currency remeasurement (17 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees, net of interest rate swap gain (5 ) Tax benefit related to the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowance offset by additional liability related to uncertain tax positions 24 Non cash tax benefit transferred from other income categories 8 48 Charge for asbestos related costs (170 ) (180 ) Total $ (176 ) $ (334 ) Executive Overview Comparison of 2009 with 2008 2009 Highlights Strategic review of manufacturing footprint resulted in $122 million of fixed costs savings Inventory levels reduced by 11% due to strategic review of manufacturing footprint, temporary production curtailments and other management initiatives Free cash flow generation of $322 million Issued $600 million senior notes due 2016 and extinguished $222 million of the senior debentures due 2010 Net sales were $888 million lower than the prior year principally resulting from decreased shipments and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher selling prices and improved mix. Segment Operating Profit for reportable segments was $156 million lower than the prior year. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower sales volume and increased manufacturing and delivery costs resulting from temporary production curtailments and inflationary cost increases. Partially offsetting these costs were higher selling prices and savings from permanent curtailment of plant capacity and realignment of selected operations. Interest expense in 2009 decreased $31 million compared with 2008, principally due to lower variable interest rates under the Companys bank credit agreement as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company for 2009 were $110 million, or $0.65 per share (diluted), compared to $175 million, or $1.03 per share (diluted) for 2008. Earnings in both periods included items that management considered not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased net earnings in 2009 by $334 million, or $1.96 per share, and decreased net earnings in 2008 by $394 million, or $2.32 per share. 29  Table of Contents Results of Operations Comparison of 2009 with 2008 Net Sales The Companys net sales in 2009 were $6,652 million compared with $7,540 million in 2008, a decrease of $888 million, or 11.8%. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net sales declined in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a 10% reduction in shipments as a result of weaker market conditions and customer de stocking in the first half of the year. Partially offsetting this lower volume was improved price and mix, primarily due to the Companys price over volume strategy aimed at improving margins. This strategy also contributed to the lower shipments in 2009. The change in net sales of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Net sales 2008 $ 7,463 Net effect of price and mix $ 264 Decreased sales volume (777 ) Effects of changing foreign currency rates (344 ) Total effect on net sales (857 ) Net sales 2009 $ 6,606 Segment Operating Profit Operating Profit of the reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments operations are included in Retained Corporate Costs and Other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Operating Profit of reportable segments in 2009 was $891 million compared to $1,047 million in 2008, a decrease of $156 million, or 14.9%. The decrease was primarily due to weaker market conditions and customer de stocking, which led to a 10% reduction in shipments and to temporary production curtailments as the Company attempted to match supply with lower demand. The temporary production curtailments resulted in approximately $302 million of higher unabsorbed fixed costs. Manufacturing costs were also higher by approximately $7 million due to inflationary cost increases. Partially offsetting the decreases in Segment Operating Profit noted above were improved price and mix, lower warehouse and delivery costs and savings from the Companys strategic review of its global manufacturing footprint. Improved price and mix contributed approximately $264 million in 2009, primarily due to the Companys price over volume strategy aimed at improving margins. Warehouse and delivery costs were lower by approximately $28 million due to lower shipments and an 11% reduction in inventory levels at the end of 2009 compared to 2008. The Companys strategic review of its global manufacturing footprint led to the permanent curtailment of plant capacity and the realignment of selected operations, resulting in savings of approximately $122 million. 30 Table of Contents The change in Segment Operating Profit of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Segment Operating Profit 2008 $ 1,047 Net effect of price and mix $ 264 Decreased sales volume (256 ) Effects of changing foreign currency rates (35 ) Manufacturing and delivery (132 ) Operating expenses 6 Other (3 ) Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit (156 ) Segment Operating Profit 2009 $ 891 Interest Expense Interest expense in 2009 was $222 million compared with interest expense of $253 million in 2008. The 2009 amount includes $5 million of additional interest charges for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees, net of a gain from the termination of interest rate swap agreements following the May tender for the 7.50% Senior Debentures due May 2010. Exclusive of these items, interest expense decreased approximately $37 million. The decrease is principally due to lower variable interest rates under the Companys bank credit agreement as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Income Interest income for 2009 was $18 million compared to $25 million for 2008. The decrease is principally due to lower interest rates on investments, which more than offset the additional interest earned on the Companys higher cash balance. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2009 was 38.6%, compared with 48.4% for 2008. The provision for 2009 includes a non cash tax benefit transferred from other comprehensive income of $48 million (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). The provision for 2008 includes a net expense of $33 million related to tax legislation, restructuring, and other. Excluding the amounts related to items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations, the Companys effective tax rate for 2009 was 24.0% compared to 24.3% for 2008. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2009 were $36 million compared to $70 million for 2008. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests were reduced by $9 million in 2009 related to restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded during the year. Excluding this amount, net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2009 decreased $25 million compared with 2008. The decrease is primarily a result of lower segment operating profit in the Companys South American segment in 2009. Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to the Company For 2009, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $110 million compared to $175 million for 2008. The after tax effects of the items excluded from 31 Table of Contents Segment Operating Profit, the 2009 additional interest charges, and the 2009 and 2008 unusual tax items increased or decreased earnings in 2009 and 2008 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2009 2008 Restructuring and asset impairment $ (180 ) $ (110 ) Charge for currency remeasurement (17 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees, net of interest rate swap gain (5 ) Non cash tax benefit transferred from other income categories 48 Net expense related to tax legislation, restructuring and other (35 ) Charge for asbestos related costs (180 ) (249 ) Total $ (334 ) $ (394 ) Items Excluded from Reportable Segment Totals Retained Corporate Costs and Other Retained corporate costs and other for 2010 were $89 million compared with $67 million for 2009. The increased expense in 2010 is mainly attributable to increased employee benefit costs, primarily pension expense. Retained corporate costs and other for 2009 were $67 million compared with $1 million for 2008. The increased expense in 2009 is mainly attributable to increased employee benefit costs, primarily pension expense, and lower royalty income. Restructuring and Asset Impairments During 2010, the Company recorded charges totaling $13 million ($11 million after tax amount attributable to the Company) for restructuring and asset impairment. The charges reflect the completion of previously announced actions in North America and Europe related to the Companys strategic review of its global manufacturing footprint. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Charges for similar actions in Europe, North America and South America during 2009 totaled $207 million ($180 million after tax amount attributable to the Company). See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Charges for similar actions during 2008 totaled $133 million ($109 million after tax amount attributable to the Company). See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During 2008, the Company also recorded an additional $1 million (pretax and after tax amount attributable to the Company), related to the impairment of the Companys equity investment in the South American Segments 50% owned Caribbean affiliate. Acquisition related fair value inventory adjustments and restructuring, transaction and financing costs The Company recorded charges of $12 million ($7 million after tax amount attributable to the Company) for acquisition related fair value inventory adjustments. This charge was due to the accounting rules requiring inventory purchased in a business combination to be marked up to fair value, and then recorded as an increase to cost of goods sold as the inventory is sold. The Company 32 Table of Contents also recorded charges of $20 million (pretax and after tax amount attributable to the Company) for acquisition related restructuring, transaction and financing costs. Charge for Currency Remeasurement Due to Venezuelan government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country at the official rate, the Company remeasured certain bolivar denominated assets and liabilities held outside of Venezuela to the parallel market rate and recorded a charge of $18 million ($17 million after tax amount attributable to the Company) in 2009. Charge for Asbestos Related Costs The fourth quarter of 2010 charge for asbestos related costs was $170 million (pretax and after tax), compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 charge of $180 million (pretax and after tax). These charges resulted from the Companys comprehensive annual review of asbestos related liabilities and costs. In each year, the Company concluded that an increase in the accrued liability was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims pending and expected to be filed during the several years following the completion of the comprehensive review. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" for further information. Asbestos related cash payments for 2010 were $179 million, a decrease of $11 million from 2009. Deferred amounts payable were approximately $26 million and $36 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2010, the Company received approximately 3,000 new filings and disposed of approximately 4,000 claims. As of December 31, 2010, the number of asbestos related claims pending against the Company was approximately 6,000. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet all asbestos related obligations on a short term and long term basis. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Discontinued Operations On October 26, 2010, the Venezuelan government, through Presidential Decree No. 7.751, expropriated the assets of Owens Illinois de Venezuela, C.A. and Fabrica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A., two of the Companys subsidiaries in that country, which in effect constituted a taking of the going concerns of those companies. Shortly after the issuance of the decree, the Venezuelan government installed temporary administrative boards who are in control of the expropriated assets. Since the issuance of the decree, the Company has cooperated with the Venezuelan government, as it is compelled to do under Venezuelan law, to provide for an orderly transition while ensuring the safety and well being of the employees and the integrity of the production facilities. The Company is also engaged in negotiations with the Venezuelan government in relation to certain aspects of the expropriation, including the compensation payable by the government as a result of its expropriation. The Company reserves and will continue to reserve the right to seek and obtain just compensation, representing the market value of its investment in Venezuela, in exchange for the expropriated assets pursuant to, as appropriate, applicable domestic and or international law. The Company is unable at this stage to predict the amount, or timing of receipt, of compensation it will ultimately receive. The Company considers the disposal of these assets to be complete as of December 31, 2010. As a result, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company has presented the results of operations for its Venezuelan subsidiaries in the Consolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 as discontinued operations. Amounts for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. At December 31, 2009, the assets and 33 Table of Contents liabilities of the Venezuelan operations are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations. The following summarizes the revenues and expenses of the Venezuelan operations reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Results of Operations for the periods indicated: Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 129 $ 415 $ 345 Manufacturing, shipping, and delivery (86 ) (266 ) (214 ) Gross profit 43 149 131 Selling and administrative expense (5 ) (13 ) (13 ) Research, development, and engineering expense (1 ) (1 ) Interest income 11 13 Other expense 3 (36 ) (8 ) Earnings from discontinued operations before income taxes 41 110 122 Provision for income taxes (10 ) (44 ) (26 ) Earnings from discontinued operations 31 66 96 Loss on disposal of discontinued operations (331 ) Net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations (300 ) 66 96 Net earnings from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (5 ) (14 ) (20 ) Net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to the Company $ (305 ) $ 52 $ 76 The loss on disposal of discontinued operations of $331 million includes charges totaling $77 million and $260 million to write off the net assets and cumulative currency translation losses, respectively, of the Companys Venezuelan operations, net of a tax benefit of $6 million. The net assets were written off as a result of the deconsolidation of the subsidiaries due to the loss of control. The type or amount of compensation the Company may receive from the Venezuelan government is uncertain and thus, will be recorded as a gain from discontinued operations when received. The cumulative currency translation losses relate to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar in prior years and were written off because the expropriation was a substantially complete disposal of the Companys operations in Venezuela. 34 Table of Contents The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009 included the following assets and liabilities related to the discontinued operations of the Companys Venezuelan subsidiaries: Balance at December 31, 2009 Assets: Cash $ 57 Accounts receivable 21 Inventories 11 Prepaid expenses 3 Total current assets 92 Other long term assets 3 Net property, plant, and equipment 31 Total assets $ 126 Liabilities: Accounts payable and other current liabilities $ 12 Other long term liabilities 15 Total liabilities $ 27 The gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $7 million reported in 2008 relates to an adjustment of the 2007 gain on the sale of the plastics packaging business mainly related to finalizing certain tax allocations and an adjustment to the selling price in accordance with procedures set forth in the final contract. Capital Resources and Liquidity As of December 31, 2010, the Company had cash and total debt of $640 million and $4.3 billion, respectively, compared to $755 million and $3.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2009. Current and Long Term Debt On June 14, 2006, the Companys subsidiary borrowers entered into the Secured Credit Agreement (the "Agreement"). At December 31, 2010, the Agreement included a $900 million revolving credit facility, a 90 million Australian dollar term loan, and a 111 million Canadian dollar term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of June 15, 2012. It also included a $190 million term loan and a &euro;190 million term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of June 14, 2013. During 2010, the Companys subsidiary borrowers repaid 70 million Australian dollars of term loans under the Agreement. At December 31, 2010 the Companys subsidiary borrowers had unused credit of $732 million available under the Agreement. The Agreement contains various covenants that restrict, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur certain liens, make certain investments and acquisitions, become liable under contingent obligations in certain defined instances only, make restricted junior payments, make certain asset sales within guidelines and limits, make capital expenditures beyond a certain threshold, engage in material transactions with shareholders and affiliates, participate in sale and leaseback financing arrangements, alter its fundamental business, amend certain outstanding debt obligations, and prepay certain outstanding debt obligations. 35  Table of Contents The Agreement also contains one financial maintenance covenant, a Leverage Ratio, that requires the Company not to exceed a ratio calculated by dividing consolidated total debt, less cash and cash equivalents, by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Agreement. The Leverage Ratio could restrict the ability of the Company to undertake additional financing to the extent that such financing would cause the Leverage Ratio to exceed the specified maximum. Failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default under the Agreement. In such an event, the Company could not request borrowings under the revolving facility, and all amounts outstanding under the Agreement, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. If an event of default occurs under the Agreement and the lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Agreement to become due and payable, this would result in a default under a number of other outstanding debt securities and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to these debt securities. A default or event of default under the Agreement, indentures or agreements governing other indebtedness could also lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions. The Leverage Ratio also determines pricing under the Agreement. The interest rate on borrowings under the Agreement is, at the Companys option, the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Agreement. These rates include a margin linked to the Leverage Ratio and the borrowers senior secured debt rating. The margins range from 0.875% to 1.75% for Eurocurrency Rate loans and from 0.125% to 0.75% for Base Rate loans. In addition, a facility fee is payable on the revolving credit facility commitments ranging from 0.20% to 0.50% per annum linked to the Leverage Ratio. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Agreement at December 31, 2010 was 2.7%. As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and restrictions in the Agreement. In addition, the Company believes that it will remain in compliance and that its ability to borrow funds under the Agreement will not be adversely affected by the covenants and restrictions. During May 2010, a subsidiary of the Company issued exchangeable senior notes with a face value of $690 million due June 1, 2015 ("2015 Exchangeable Notes"). The 2015 Exchangeable Notes bear interest at 3.00% and are guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries. The net proceeds, after deducting debt issuance costs, totaled approximately $672 million. Upon exchange of the 2015 Exchangeable Notes, under the terms outlined below, the issuer of the 2015 Exchangeable Notes is required to settle the principal amount in cash and the Company is required to settle the exchange premium in shares of the Companys common stock. The exchange premium is calculated as the value of the Companys common stock in excess of the initial exchange price of approximately $47.47 per share, which is equivalent to an exchange rate of 21.0642 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2015 Exchangeable Notes. The exchange rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, such as certain distributions, dividends or issuances of cash, stock, options, warrants or other property or effecting a share split, or a significant change in the ownership or structure of the Company, such as a recapitalization or reclassification of the Companys common stock, a merger or consolidation involving the Company or the sale or conveyance to another person of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company and its subsidiaries substantially as an entirety. Prior to March 1, 2015, the 2015 Exchangeable Notes may be exchanged only if (1) the price of the Companys common stock exceeds $61.71 (130% of the exchange price) for a specified period of time, (2) the trading price of the 2015 Exchangeable Notes falls below 98% of the average exchange value of the 2015 Exchangeable Notes for a specified period of time (trading price was 157% of exchange value at December 31, 2010), or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions. The 2015 Exchangeable Notes may be exchanged without restrictions on or after March 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2010, the 2015 Exchangeable Notes are not exchangeable by the holders. 36 Table of Contents During June 2010, a subsidiary of the Company redeemed all $450 million of the 8.25% senior notes due 2013. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company recorded $9 million of additional interest charges for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees. In addition, the Company recorded a reduction of interest expense of $9 million during the second quarter of 2010 to recognize the unamortized proceeds from terminated interest rate swaps on these notes. During September 2010, a subsidiary of the Company issued senior notes with a face value of &euro;500 million due September 15, 2020. The notes bear interest at 6.75% and are guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries. The net proceeds, after deducting debt issuance costs, totaled approximately $625 million. The Company assesses its capital raising and refinancing needs on an ongoing basis and may seek to issue equity and or debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets if market conditions are favorable. During October 2006, the Company entered into a &euro;250 million European accounts receivable securitization program. The program extends through October 2011, subject to annual renewal of backup credit lines. In addition, the Company participated in a receivables financing program in the Asia Pacific region with a revolving funding commitment of 10 million New Zealand dollars. This program expired in October 2010. Information related to the Companys accounts receivable securitization program as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows: 2010 2009 Balance (included in short term loans) $ 247 $ 289 Weighted average interest rate 2.40 % 2.52 % Cash Flows Free cash flow was $100 million for 2010 compared to $322 million for 2009. The Company defines free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operating activities less additions to property, plant, and equipment from continuing operations. Free cash flow does not conform to U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to the cash flow measures reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company uses free cash flow for internal reporting, forecasting and budgeting and believes this information allows the board of directors, management, investors and analysts to better understand the Companys financial performance. Free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is calculated as follows (dollars in millions): 2010 2009 Cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 600 $ 729 Additions to property, plant, and equipment continuing (500 ) (407 ) Free cash flow $ 100 $ 322 Operating activities: Cash provided by continuing operating activities was $600 million for 2010 compared to $729 million for 2009. The decrease in cash flows from continuing operating activities was primarily due to an increase in working capital of $71 million in 2010 compared to a decrease in working capital of $156 million in 2009. The change in working capital in 2010 compared to 2009 was mainly due to the change in inventory. The Companys strategic review of its manufacturing footprint, temporary production curtailments and other management initiatives resulted in an 11% reduction in inventory levels in 2009. Inventory levels at December 31, 2010 have increased from the low levels at 37 Table of Contents the end of 2009 as the Company expects more sales growth in 2011. The decrease in cash flows from continuing operating activities was also due to increased interest payments of $34 million as a result of higher debt balances, partially offset by an increase in dividends received from equity investments of $28 million. During 2010, the Company contributed $22 million to its non U.S. defined benefit pension plans, compared with $122 million in 2009. The 2009 contributions included $50 million of accelerated 2010 contributions. The Company was not required to make cash contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans during 2010. Contributions beyond 2011 are dependent on future asset returns and discount rates which the Company is unable to predict. However, the Company believes that contributions to its non U.S. plans will be approximately $50 million to $60 million and that it will not be required to make contributions to its U.S. plans in 2011. The Company may elect to contribute amounts in excess of minimum required amounts in order to improve the funded status of certain plans. Investing activities: Cash utilized in investing activities was $1,314 million for 2010 compared to $418 million for 2009. The increase was primarily due to cash paid for acquisitions of $817 million in 2010 as the Company acquired glass container manufacturing plants in Argentina, Brazil and China and invested in a joint venture with operations in Malaysia, Vietnam and China. Capital spending for property, plant, and equipment from continuing operations was $500 million for 2010 compared to $407 million for 2009. The increase in capital spending was due to restructuring activities in North America and new furnace expansions in South America and Asia Pacific. Financing activities: Cash provided by financing activities was $547 million for 2010 compared to $114 million for 2009. Cash provided by financing activities during 2010 included the issuance of the $690 million exchangeable senior notes due 2015 and the &euro;500 million senior notes due 2020. During 2010, the Company also repaid the $450 million senior notes due 2013 and repurchased shares of its common stock for $199 million. The Company anticipates that cash flows from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs, debt service and other obligations on a short term (twelve months) and long term basis. Based on the Companys expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the Companys expected operating cash flow, the Company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Companys liquidity on a short term or long term basis. 38 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following information summarizes the Companys significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2010 (dollars in millions). Payments due by period Total Less than one year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Contractual cash obligations: Long term debt $ 4,028 $ 77 $ 626 $ 1,402 $ 1,923 Capital lease obligations 91 20 36 23 12 Operating leases 137 41 56 32 8 Interest(1) 1,323 240 448 337 298 Purchase obligations(2) 915 630 280 5 Pension benefit plan contributions 60 60 Postretirement benefit plan benefit payments(1) 201 21 41 42 97 Total contractual cash obligations $ 6,755 $ 1,089 $ 1,487 $ 1,841 $ 2,338 Amount of commitment expiration per period Total Less than one year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Other commercial commitments: Standby letters of credit $ 135 $ 135 Total commercial commitments $ 135 $ 135 (1)Amounts based on rates and assumptions at December 31, 2010. (2)The Companys purchase obligations consist principally of contracted amounts for energy and molds. In cases where variable prices are involved, current market prices have been used. The amount above does not include ordinary course of business purchase orders because the majority of such purchase orders may be canceled. The Company does not believe such purchase orders will adversely affect its liquidity position. The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement with taxing authorities may occur for its unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the financial statements are issued. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be 39 Table of Contents readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, estimates and assumptions are discussed within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where estimates and assumptions affect the Companys reported and expected financial results. The Company believes that accounting for property, plant and equipment, impairment of long lived assets, pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, and income taxes involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Property, Plant and Equipment The net carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment ("PP&E") at December 31, 2010 totaled $3,107 million, representing 32% of total assets. Depreciation expense during 2010 totaled $369 million, representing approximately 6% of total costs and expenses. Given the significance of PP&E and associated depreciation to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the determinations of an assets cost basis and its economic useful life are considered to be critical accounting estimates. Cost Basis PP&E is recorded at cost, which is generally objectively quantifiable when assets are purchased individually. However, when assets are purchased in groups, or as part of a business, costs assigned to PP&E are based on an estimate of fair value of each asset at the date of acquisition. These estimates are based on assumptions about asset condition, remaining useful life and market conditions, among others. The Company frequently employs expert appraisers to aid in allocating cost among assets purchased as a group. Included in the cost basis of PP&E are those costs which substantially increase the useful lives or capacity of existing PP&E. Significant judgment is needed to determine which costs should be capitalized under these criteria and which costs should be expensed as a repair or maintenance expenditure. For example, the Company frequently incurs various costs related to its existing glass melting furnaces and forming machines and must make a determination of which costs, if any, to capitalize. The Company relies on the experience and expertise of its operations and engineering staff to make reasonable and consistent judgments regarding increases in useful lives or capacity of PP&E. Estimated Useful Life PP&E is generally depreciated using the straight line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings each period over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by the Company, which may be less than its physical life. Managements assumptions regarding the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, product and process obsolescence, technical standards, and changes in market demand. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, technological advances, excessive wear and tear, or changes in customers requirements may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, the Company depreciates the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Changes in economic useful life assumptions did not have a material impact on the Companys reported results in 2010, 2009 or 2008. 40 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived Assets Property, Plant, and Equipment The Company tests for impairment of PP&E whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. PP&E held for use in the Companys business is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which cash flows can reasonably be identified, typically a geographic region. The Company evaluates the recoverability of property, plant, and equipment based on undiscounted projected cash flows, excluding interest and taxes. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset groups carrying amount exceeds its fair value. PP&E held for sale is reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Impairment testing requires estimation of the fair value of PP&E based on the discounted value of projected future cash flows generated by the asset group. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent managements best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include, among other things: industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, production costs and inflation. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. The Company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. In mid 2007, the Company began a strategic review of its global manufacturing footprint. As a result of this review, during 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, the Company recorded charges that included impairments of property, plant, and equipment across all segments including certain Retained Corporate Costs and Other activities. While the Company has concluded this strategic review of its manufacturing footprint, it is possible that the Company may conclude in the future that it will close or temporarily idle additional selected facilities or production lines and reduce headcount to increase operating performance and cash flows. As of December 31, 2010, no other decisions had been made and no events had occurred that would require an additional evaluation of possible impairment. For additional information on charges recorded in 2010, 2009 and 2008, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill Goodwill at December 31, 2010 totaled $2,821 million, representing 29% of total assets. The Company evaluates goodwill annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. The Company conducts its evaluation as of October 1 of each year. Goodwill impairment testing is performed using the business enterprise value ("BEV") of each reporting unit which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free, after tax projected future cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer. This BEV is then compared to the book value of each reporting unit as of the measurement date to assess whether an impairment of goodwill may exist. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company completed its annual testing and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. The testing performed as of October 1, 2010, indicated a significant excess of BEV over book value for each unit. If the Companys projected future cash flows were substantially lower, or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital was substantially higher, the testing performed as of October 1, 2010, may have indicated an impairment of one or more of the Companys reporting units and, as a result, the related goodwill may also have been impaired. However, less significant changes in projected future cash flows or the assumed weighted average cost of capital would not have indicated an impairment. For example, if projected future cash flows had been decreased by 5%, or if the weighted average cost of capital had been increased by 5%, or both, the resulting lower BEVs would still have exceeded the book value of each reporting unit. 41  Table of Contents The Company will monitor conditions throughout 2011 that might significantly affect the projections and variables used in the impairment test to determine if a review prior to October 1 may be appropriate. If the results of impairment testing confirm that a write down of goodwill is necessary, then the Company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of 2011, or earlier if appropriate. In the event the Company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill, the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth. Other Long Lived Assets Other long lived assets include, among others, equity investments and repair parts inventories. The Companys equity investments are non publicly traded ventures with other companies in businesses related to those of the Company. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2008, the Company recorded charges that included impairments of an equity investment. For additional information on these charges, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company carries a significant amount of repair parts inventories in order to provide a dependable supply of quality parts for servicing the Companys PP&E, particularly its glass melting furnaces and forming machines. The Company evaluates the recoverability of repair parts inventories based on undiscounted projected cash flows, excluding interest and taxes, when factors indicate that impairment may exist. If impairment exists, the repair parts are written down to fair value. The Company continually monitors the carrying value of repair parts for recoverability, especially in light of changing business circumstances. For example, technological advances related to, and changes in, the estimated future demand for products produced on the equipment to which the repair parts relate may make the repair parts obsolete. In these circumstances, the Company writes down the repair parts to fair value. Pension Benefit Plans Significant Estimates The determination of pension obligations and the related pension expense or credits to operations involves significant estimates. The most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The Company uses discount rates based on yields of high quality fixed rate debt securities at the end of the year. At December 31, 2010, the weighted average discount rate was 5.24% and 5.28% for U.S. and non U.S. plans, respectively. The Company uses an expected long term rate of return on assets that is based on both past performance of the various plans assets and estimated future performance of the assets. Due to the nature of the plans assets and the volatility of debt and equity markets, actual returns may vary significantly from year to year. The Company refers to average historical returns over longer periods (up to 10 years) in determining its expected rates of return because short term fluctuations in market values do not reflect the rates of return the Company expects to achieve based upon its long term investing strategy. For purposes of determining pension charges and credits in 2011, the Companys estimated weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 8.0% for U.S. plans and 6.4% for non U.S. plans compared to 8.0% for U.S. plans and 6.8% for non U.S. plans in 2010. The Company recorded pension expense (income) from continuing operations of $36 million, $10 million, and $(41) million for the U.S. plans in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, and $37 million, $35 million, and $16 million for the non U.S. plans from its principal defined benefit pension plans. The increase in pension expense in 2010 is principally a result of the amortization of prior period actuarial losses. Depending on currency translation rates, the Company expects to record approximately $90 million of total pension expense for the full year of 2011. Future effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance. For example, a one half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding the expected return on assets would result in a change of approximately $18 million in the pretax 42 Table of Contents pension expense for the full year 2011. In addition, changes in external factors, including the fair values of plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities, could have a significant effect on the recognition of funded status as described below. For example, a one half percentage point change in the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities would result in a change of approximately $20 million in the pretax pension expense for the full year 2011. Recognition of Funded Status Generally accepted accounting principles for pension benefit plans require employers to adjust the assets and liabilities related to defined benefit plans so that the amounts reflected on the balance sheet represent the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans. These funded status amounts are measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and actuarially calculated benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2010, the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss component of share owners equity was decreased by $60 million ($56 million after tax attributable to non U.S. pension plans) to reflect a net increase in the funded status of the Companys plans at that date. Contingencies and Litigation The Company believes that its ultimate asbestos related liability (i.e., its indemnity payments or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees) cannot reasonably be estimated. The Companys ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by, among other factors, the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the United States, the significant number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy, the magnitude and timing of co defendant bankruptcy trust payments, the inherent uncertainty of future disease incidence and claiming patterns, the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation, and the use of mass litigation screenings to generate large numbers of claims by parties who allege exposure to asbestos dust but have no present physical asbestos impairment. The Company continues to monitor trends that may affect its ultimate liability and continues to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the Company. The Company conducts a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs annually in connection with finalizing and reporting its annual results of operations, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review. If the results of an annual comprehensive review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is insufficient to cover its estimated future asbestos related costs, then the Company will record an appropriate charge to increase the accrued liability. The Company believes that a reasonable estimation of the probable amount of the liability for claims not yet asserted against the Company is not possible beyond a period of several years. Therefore, while the results of future annual comprehensive reviews cannot be determined, the Company expects the addition of one year to the estimation period will result in an annual charge. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a charge of $170 million (pretax and after tax) to increase its accrued liability for asbestos related costs. This amount was lower than the 2009 charge of $180 million. The factors and developments that particularly affected the determination of the amount of the 2010 accrual included the following: (i) the rates and average disposition costs of new filings against the Company; (ii) the Companys successful litigation record; (iii) legislative developments and court rulings in several states; and (iv) the impact these and other factors had on the Companys valuation of existing and future claims. The Companys estimates are based on a number of factors as described further in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other litigation is pending against the Company, in many cases involving ordinary and routine claims incidental to the business of the Company and in others presenting allegations that are non routine and involve compensatory, punitive or treble damage claims as well as other types of relief. The Company records a liability for such matters when it is both probable that the liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Recorded amounts are reviewed 43 Table of Contents and adjusted to reflect changes in the factors upon which the estimates are based, including additional information, negotiations, settlements and other events. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes as required by general accounting principles under which management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. This judgment includes estimating and analyzing historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and the ultimate outcome of uncertain income tax positions. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used for calculating income tax expense and potential differences in actual results from estimates could have a material impact on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which the Company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is dependent upon historical profitability and future sources of taxable income including the effects of tax planning. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. Accordingly, evidence related to objective historical losses is typically given more weight than projected profitability. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets, where based on the weight of available evidence it is unlikely to realize those deferred tax assets.  ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates, and changes in commodity prices, principally energy and soda ash. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating energy prices. These instruments carry varying degrees of counterparty credit risk. To mitigate this risk, the Company has established limits on the exposure with individual counterparties and the Company regularly monitors these exposures. Substantially all of these exposures are with counterparties that are rated single A or above. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Earnings of operations outside the United States A substantial portion of the Companys operations are conducted by subsidiaries outside the U.S. The primary international markets served by the Companys subsidiaries are in Canada, Australia, China, South America (principally Colombia and Brazil), and Europe (principally Italy, France, The Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Poland). In general, revenues earned and costs incurred by the Companys major international operations are denominated in their respective local currencies. Consequently, the Companys reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the international markets in which the Companys subsidiaries operate. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the reported U.S. dollar value of local currency earnings generally decreases; when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the reported U.S. dollar value of local currency earnings generally increases. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company did not have any significant foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was the U.S. 44 Table of Contents dollar. The Company does not hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to earnings of operations outside the United States. Borrowings not denominated in the functional currency Because the Companys subsidiaries operate within their local economic environment, the Company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with borrowings denominated in the local currency to the extent practicable where debt financing is desirable or necessary. Considerations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans, tax implications, and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms. In those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency, this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. In those countries where the U.S. dollar is the designated functional currency, however, local currency borrowings expose the Company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. Available excess funds of a subsidiary may be redeployed through intercompany loans to other subsidiaries for debt repayment, capital investment, or other cash requirements. Generally, each intercompany loan is denominated in the lenders local currency giving rise to foreign currency exchange rate risk for the borrower. To mitigate this risk, the borrower generally enters into a forward exchange contract which effectively swaps the intercompany loan and related interest to its local currency. The Company believes the near term exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk of its foreign currency risk sensitive instruments was not material at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates applicable to the term loans under its Secured Credit Agreement (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). The Companys interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on net income and cash flow, while minimizing interest payments and expense. To achieve this objective, the Company regularly evaluates its mix of fixed and floating rate debt, and, from time to time, may enter into interest rate swap agreements. The following table provides information about the Companys interest rate sensitivity related to its significant debt obligations at December 31, 2010. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date. (dollars in millions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Fair Value at 12/31/2010 Long term debt at variable rate: Principal by expected maturity $ 97 $ 203 $ 459 $ 20 $ 15 $ 17 $ 811 $ 811 Avg. principal outstanding $ 763 $ 613 $ 282 $ 42 $ 25 $ 17 Avg. interest rate 2.67 % 2.67 % 2.67 % 2.67 % 2.67 % 2.67 % Long term debt at fixed rate: Principal by expected maturity $ 700 $ 690 $ 1,919 $ 3,309 $ 3,424 Avg. principal outstanding $ 3,309 $ 3,309 $ 3,309 $ 3,251 $ 2,206 $ 1,919 Avg. interest rate 6.47 % 6.47 % 6.47 % 7.20 % 7.20 % 7.14 % The Company believes the near term exposure to interest rate risk of its debt obligations has not changed materially since December 31, 2009. 45 Table of Contents Commodity Price Risk The Company has exposure to commodity price risk, principally related to energy. The Company mitigates a portion of this risk by passing commodity cost changes through to customers. In addition, the Company enters into commodity futures contracts related to forecasted natural gas requirements, the objectives of which are to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid for natural gas and the related volatility in cash flows. The Company continually evaluates the natural gas market with respect to its forecasted usage requirements over the next twelve to twenty four months and periodically enters into commodity futures contracts in order to hedge a portion of its usage requirements over that period. At December 31, 2010, the Company had entered into commodity futures contracts covering approximately 8,900,000 MM BTUs over that period. The Company believes the near term exposure to commodity price risk of its commodity futures contracts was not material at December 31, 2010. Forward Looking Statements This document contains "forward looking" statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933.
