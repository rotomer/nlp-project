ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Following are the Companys net sales by segment and segment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 (dollars in millions). The Companys measure of profit for its reportable segments is Segment Operating Profit, which consists of consolidated earnings from continuing operations before interest income, interest expense, and provision for income taxes and excludes amounts related to certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations as well as certain retained corporate costs. The segment data presented below is prepared in accordance with general accounting principles for segment reporting. The line titled reportable segment totals, however, is a non GAAP measure when presented outside of the financial statement footnotes. Management has included reportable segment totals below to facilitate the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. The Companys management uses Segment Operating Profit, in combination with selected cash flow information, to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. 2011 2010 2009 Net Sales: Europe $ 3,052 $ 2,746 $ 2,918 North America 1,929 1,879 2,074 South America 1,226 975 689 Asia Pacific 1,059 996 925 Reportable segment totals 7,266 6,596 6,606 Other 92 37 46 Net Sales $ 7,358 $ 6,633 $ 6,652 26 Table of Contents 2011 2010 2009 Segment Operating Profit: Europe $ 325 $ 324 $ 333 North America 236 275 282 South America 250 224 145 Asia Pacific 83 141 131 Reportable segment totals 894 964 891 Items excluded from Segment Operating Profit: Retained corporate costs and other (79 ) (89 ) (67 ) Restructuring and asset impairment (112 ) (13 ) (207 ) Acquisition related fair value inventory adjustments and restructuring, transaction and financing costs (32 ) Charge for currency remeasurement (18 ) Charge for asbestos related costs (165 ) (170 ) (180 ) Charge for goodwill impairment (641 ) Interest income 11 13 18 Interest expense (314 ) (249 ) (222 ) Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (406 ) 424 215 Provision for income taxes (85 ) (129 ) (83 ) Earnings (loss) from continuing operations (491 ) 295 132 Earnings from discontinued operations 31 66 Gain (loss) on disposal of discontinued operations 1 (331 ) Net earnings (loss) (490 ) (5 ) 198 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (20 ) (42 ) (36 ) Net earnings (loss) attributable to the Company $ (510 ) $ (47 ) $ 162 Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to the Company $ (511 ) $ 258 $ 110 Note: all amounts excluded from reportable segment totals are discussed in the following applicable sections. Executive Overview Comparison of 2011 with 2010 2011 Highlights Net sales increased as 2010 acquisitions and improving market conditions drove more than a 5% increase in tonnes shipped Lower Segment Operating Profit due to higher cost inflation and manufacturing costs Goodwill impairment charge recorded related to Asia Pacific segment Completed new $2 billion bank credit agreement and redeemed $400 million and &euro;225 million senior notes due 2014 Net sales were $725 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to higher sales volumes and the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by lower wine and beer bottle shipments in Australia. Segment Operating Profit for reportable segments was $70 million lower than the prior year. The decrease was mainly attributable to additional cost inflation, production and supply chain issues in 27 Table of Contents North America during the second quarter of 2011, and the impact of macroeconomic conditions in Australia. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales volumes and capacity utilization. Interest expense in 2011 increased $65 million over 2010. The increase was principally due to note repurchase premiums and the write off of finance fees related to debt redeemed in 2011, as well as additional interest related to debt issued in 2010 to fund acquisitions. The net loss from continuing operations attributable to the Company for 2011 was $511 million, or $3.12 per share, compared to net earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $258 million, or $1.55 per share (diluted) for 2010. Earnings in both periods included items that management considered not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company in 2011 by $905 million, or $5.49 per share, and decreased net earnings attributable to the Company in 2010 by $176 million, or $1.05 per share. Results of Operations Comparison of 2011 with 2010 Net Sales The Companys net sales in 2011 were $7,358 million compared with $6,633 million in 2010, an increase of $725 million, or 11%. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher glass container shipments and the favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Glass container shipments, in tonnes, were up more than 5% in 2011 compared to 2010, with the acquisitions in Argentina, Brazil and China in 2010 representing about 4 percentage points of the volume growth. The remaining increase in volume was due to improving market conditions, as favorable demand in Europe and South America more than offset lower volume in Australia. Foreign currency exchange rate changes increased net sales in 2011 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a stronger Euro, Australian dollar and Brazilian real in relation to the U.S. dollar. The change in net sales of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Net sales 2010 $ 6,596 Sales volume $ 335 Price Price 67 Product mix (41 ) Cost pass through provisions (1 ) Effects of changing foreign currency rates 310 Total effect on net sales 670 Net sales 2011 $ 7,266 Europe: Net sales in Europe in 2011 were $3,052 million compared with $2,746 million in 2010, an increase of $306 million, or 11%. Approximately half of the increase in net sales was due to the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, as the Euro strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar. In addition, glass container shipment levels increased more than 4% as demand grew across all key end use categories, particularly in the beer and wine segments. Net sales also improved in 2011 due to energy surcharges implemented in the second half of the year to help offset the high energy cost inflation in the region. North America: Net sales in North America in 2011 were $1,929 million compared with $1,879 million in 2010, an increase of $50 million, or 3%. The increase in net sales was primarily due to slightly higher glass container shipment levels as improved volumes in wine, spirits and craft beer end use categories offset the continued decline in the mega beer category. Net sales also increased due 28 Table of Contents to the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, as the Canadian dollar strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar. South America: Net sales in South America in 2011 were $1,226 million compared with $975 million in 2010, an increase of $251 million, or 26%. Glass container shipments were up about 22% in the current year, with the acquisitions in Argentina and Brazil in 2010 accounting for approximately half of this volume increase. The remaining volume increase was due to strong growth in the region, primarily in Brazil, Peru and Argentina. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes also contributed to the increase in net sales in 2011, primarily due to the strengthening of the Brazilian real in relation to the U.S. dollar. Asia Pacific: Net sales in Asia Pacific in 2011 were $1,059 million compared with $996 million in 2010, an increase of $63 million, or 6%. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes increased net sales in 2011 due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar. Glass container shipment levels increased about 3%, with all the increase attributable to the acquisitions in China in 2010. Glass container shipments in Australia were down about 10% in 2011 compared to the prior year, primarily in the wine and beer end use categories. The decrease in shipments of wine bottles was primarily due to the strong Australian dollar, which negatively impacted wine exports from the country. In addition, beer consumption decreased as high interest rates in Australia lowered consumers disposable income. Severe flooding in Australia during the first quarter of 2011 also reduced shipments in the region. Segment Operating Profit Operating Profit of the reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments operations are included in Retained corporate costs and other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Operating Profit of reportable segments in 2011 was $894 million compared to $964 million in 2010, a decrease of $70 million, or 7%. The decrease in Segment Operating Profit was primarily due to higher manufacturing and delivery costs and operating expenses, partially offset by higher sales volumes, improved pricing and the favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The higher manufacturing and delivery costs were principally due to $213 million of cost inflation, $26 million of production and supply chain issues in North America in the second quarter of 2011, and $9 million of costs related to flooding in Australia, partially offset by $40 million of higher capacity utilization and other cost savings. The cost inflation in 2011 was driven by higher raw material, labor and energy prices. The higher raw material prices were mainly due to the increased cost of soda ash in all regions. The energy inflation was primarily due to the rapid rise in European energy prices. Operating expenses were higher as the Company invested in building its sales and marketing capabilities and also incurred expenses related to the phased implementation of a global ERP software system. 29  Table of Contents The change in Segment Operating Profit of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Segment Operating Profit 2010 $ 964 Sales volume $ 75 Price 67 Manufacturing and delivery (208 ) Operating expenses and other (31 ) Effects of changing foreign currency rates 27 Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit (70 ) Segment Operating Profit 2011 $ 894 Europe: Segment operating profit in Europe in 2011 was $325 million compared with $324 million in 2010. Higher sales volume, improved pricing and the favorable effects of a stronger Euro in relation to the U.S. dollar contributed to the increased operating profit. Operating profit also increased due to higher production levels, which led to lower manufacturing costs on a per ton basis. Mostly offsetting these increases to operating profit was additional cost inflation, primarily driven by higher energy prices. In response to the rise in energy prices, the Company initiated an energy surcharge in Europe in the second half of the year. North America: Segment operating profit in North America in 2011 was $236 million compared with $275 million in 2010, a decrease of $39 million, or 14%. The lower operating profit in this region was due to higher manufacturing and delivery costs, driven by cost inflation and production and supply chain issues. This segment also incurred expenses related to building its sales and marketing capabilities and to the phased implementation of a global ERP system. This region experienced production and supply chain issues during the second quarter of 2011. Tight inventory levels and production issues led to inventory shortages at certain locations during this seasonally stronger quarter. As a result, out of pattern production was required to meet customer expectations resulting in production inefficiencies, higher freight costs and product loss. The Company restarted two previously idled furnaces in this region to reduce the out of pattern production and help meet customer demand. This region ran at high operating rates in the second half of the year and stabilized its inventory levels. South America: Segment operating profit in South America in 2011 was $250 million compared with $224 million in 2010, an increase of $26 million, or 12%. Higher sales volume, approximately half of which was related to the acquisitions in Argentina and Brazil in 2010, and higher production volume were the main reasons for the increased operating profit. To support the rapid growth in Brazil, the region incurred higher transportation costs to import glass containers into Brazil from other countries. The region also experienced higher cost inflation in 2011, which was partially offset by higher selling prices. Asia Pacific: Segment operating profit in Asia Pacific in 2011 was $83 million compared with $141 million in 2010, a decrease of $58 million, or 41%. This decrease was primarily driven by the macroeconomic effects of the strong currency and high interest rates in Australia, which led to lower wine and beer bottle shipments in the country. As a result of the lower volume, the Company temporarily curtailed production in Asia Pacific, resulting in unabsorbed manufacturing costs. The Company also permanently closed one furnace in Australia during the third quarter, and plans to close one additional furnace in early 2012. Further restructuring activities in Australia will depend on 2012 supply and demand trends and the outcome of contract negotiations. Additionally, the segment had lower sales volumes and incurred additional costs related to the severe flooding in Australia in the first 30 Table of Contents quarter of 2011. Segment operating profit in 2011 was also negatively impacted by integration issues related to one of the acquisitions in China in 2010. Interest Expense Interest expense in 2011 was $314 million compared with $249 million in 2010. The 2011 amount includes $25 million of additional interest charges for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees related to the cancellation of the Companys previous bank credit agreement and the redemption of the senior notes due 2014. Exclusive of these items, interest expense increased approximately $40 million. The increase is principally due to additional debt issued in 2010 to fund acquisitions. Interest Income Interest income for 2011 was $11 million compared to $13 million for 2010. The decrease was principally due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates on the Companys cash and investments. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2011 was 20.9%, compared with 30.4% for 2010. The effective tax rate for 2011 was impacted by the goodwill impairment charge, which was not deductible for income tax purposes. The provision for 2010 included a net tax benefit of $24 million related to the reversal of a non U.S. valuation allowance offset by additional liability related to uncertain tax positions. The provision for 2010 also included a continuing operations non cash tax benefit transferred from other income categories of $8 million (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). Excluding the amounts related to items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations, the Companys effective tax rate for 2011 was 22.0% compared to 26.2% for 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2011 was due to tax planning strategies implemented by the Company, and was also impacted by lower earnings generated in jurisdictions where the Company has higher effective tax rates. The Company expects that the effective tax rate in 2012 will approximate 24% to 26% based on current expectations of earnings by jurisdiction. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2011 was $20 million compared to $42 million for 2010. The amount for 2010 included $5 million classified as discontinued operations related to the Companys Venezuelan operations. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2011 was $20 million compared to $37 million for 2010. The decrease in 2011 was primarily a result of lower earnings in the Companys less than wholly owned subsidiaries in its South America and Asia Pacific segments in 2011, and the Companys purchase of the noncontrolling interest in its southern Brazil operations in the second quarter of 2011. Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to the Company For 2011, the Company recorded a loss from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $511 million compared to earnings of $258 million for 2010. The after tax effects of the items excluded 31 Table of Contents from Segment Operating Profit, the unusual tax items and the additional interest charges increased or decreased earnings in 2011 and 2010 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2011 2010 Restructuring and asset impairment $ (91 ) $ (11 ) Acquisition related fair value inventory adjustments and restructuring, transaction and financing costs (27 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees (24 ) Net benefit related to changes in deferred tax valuation allowance and other tax related items 15 24 Non cash tax benefit transferred from other income categories 8 Charge for asbestos related costs (165 ) (170 ) Charge for goodwill impairment (640 ) Total $ (905 ) $ (176 ) Executive Overview Comparison of 2010 with 2009 2010 Highlights Acquired glass plants in Argentina (1 plant), Brazil (3 plants) and China (3 plants) Invested in a joint venture with glass plants in China, Malaysia and Vietnam Growth in South America, acquisitions in 2010 and improved manufacturing productivity drove 8% increase in Segment Operating Profit Issued $690 million exchangeable senior notes due 2015 and &euro;500 million senior notes due 2020, and redeemed $450 million senior notes due 2013 Repurchased 6 million shares of the Companys common stock for $199 million Reclassified Venezuelan operations as discontinued operations Net sales were $19 million lower than the prior year principally resulting from decreased shipments and the impact of cost pass through provisions on certain customer contracts, partially offset by the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Segment Operating Profit for reportable segments was $73 million higher than the prior year. The increase was mainly attributable to lower manufacturing and delivery costs and the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Interest expense in 2010 was $249 million compared with interest expense of $222 million in 2009. The increase is principally due to additional debt issued in 2010 to fund acquisitions. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company for 2010 were $258 million, or $1.55 per share (diluted), compared to $110 million, or $0.65 per share (diluted) for 2009. Earnings in both periods included items that management considered not representative of ongoing operations. These items decreased net earnings in 2010 by $176 million, or $1.05 per share, and decreased net earnings in 2009 by $334 million, or $1.96 per share. The Company purchased 6 million shares of its common stock in 2010, which increased earnings per share by approximately $0.05 for 2010. The Companys Venezuelan operations were expropriated by the Venezuelan government in 2010. The Company reclassified its Venezuelan operations to discontinued operations. In addition, the 32 Table of Contents Company recognized a loss on the disposal of its Venezuelan operations as the net assets of the operations were written off. 2010 was a transition year for the Company. The Company concluded the strategic review of its global profitability and manufacturing footprint that began in 2007, and shifted its focus to profitable growth in emerging markets, which was highlighted by the acquisitions in 2010. Results of Operations Comparison of 2010 with 2009 Net Sales The Companys net sales in 2010 were $6,633 million compared with $6,652 million in 2009, a decrease of $19 million, or 0.3%. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decline in net sales in 2010 was due to lower glass container shipments and the impact of cost pass through provisions on certain customer contracts, partially offset by the favorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Glass container shipments, in tonnes, were down 1.0% in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to lower beer glass volumes in North America and Europe. The Companys beer markets remain weak in North America and Europe due to continued weakness in the economy and high unemployment levels. In addition, North American beer volumes were impacted by the loss of certain beer contracts resulting from business renegotiated at the end of 2009 in order for the Company to achieve its margin objectives. Sales volumes in 2010 also benefited from the acquisitions in Brazil and Argentina, as well as organic growth in South America where glass container shipments, excluding the acquisitions, increased approximately 20% compared to 2009. The cost pass through provisions include monthly or quarterly contractual provisions to customers, primarily in North America. Foreign currency exchange rate changes increased net sales in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a stronger Australian dollar, Brazilian real and Colombian peso in relation to the U.S. dollar, partly offset by a weaker Euro. The change in net sales of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Net sales 2009 $ 6,606 Net effect of price and mix $ 5 Customer pass through provisions (30 ) Sales volume (61 ) Effects of changing foreign currency rates 76 Total effect on net sales (10 ) Net sales 2010 $ 6,596 Europe: Net sales in Europe in 2010 were $2,746 million compared with $2,918 million in 2009, a decrease of $172 million, or 6%. Glass container shipment levels increased slightly as demand grew across most key end use categories, particularly in the wine and non alcoholic beverages segments, partially offset by lower shipments in the beer end use category. Net sales decreased in 2010 due to pricing pressures in the region and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, as the Euro weakened in relation to the U.S. dollar. North America: Net sales in North America in 2010 were $1,879 million compared with $2,074 million in 2009, a decrease of $195 million, or 9%. Glass container shipments decreased 12% in 2010 due to the loss of certain beer contracts resulting from business renegotiated at the end of 2009 in order for the Company to achieve its margin objectives. Sales volumes in the region were also lower due to continued weakness in the economy and high unemployment levels. The net sales decrease in 2010 was also due to the impact of cost pass through provisions to customers. 33 Table of Contents South America: Net sales in South America in 2010 were $975 million compared with $689 million in 2009, an increase of $286 million, or 42%. Glass container shipments were up over 30% in the current year, with the acquisitions in Argentina and Brazil in 2010 accounting for approximately one third of this volume increase. The remaining volume increase was due to strong growth in the region, as well as new product introductions. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes also contributed to the increase in net sales in 2010, primarily due to the strengthening of the Brazilian real and Colombian peso in relation to the U.S. dollar. Asia Pacific: Net sales in Asia Pacific in 2010 were $996 million compared with $925 million in 2009, an increase of $71 million, or 8%. The favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes were the primary reason for the increase in net sales, as the Australian dollar strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar. Glass container shipments were down about 5% in the current year, reflecting lower shipments in the beer and wine end use categories in Australia, partially offset by increased consumer demand in China. Segment Operating Profit Operating Profit of the reportable segments includes an allocation of some corporate expenses based on both a percentage of sales and direct billings based on the costs of specific services provided. Unallocated corporate expenses and certain other expenses not directly related to the reportable segments operations are included in Retained Corporate Costs and Other. For further information, see Segment Information included in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Operating Profit of reportable segments in 2010 was $964 million compared to $891 million in 2009, an increase of $73 million, or 8%. The net effect of price and product mix in 2010 was consistent with 2009. Sales volume had a minimal impact on Segment Operating Profit in 2010 as the decrease in glass container shipments during the year was more than offset by favorable regional sales mix, primarily due to growth of higher margin business in South America. Manufacturing and delivery costs declined $38 million from 2009 mostly due to benefits from the Companys strategic footprint alignment initiative, partially offset by $20 million of inflationary cost increases. Foreign currency exchange rate changes increased Segment Operating Profit in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a stronger Australian dollar, Brazilian real and Colombian peso in relation to the U.S. dollar, partly offset by a weaker Euro. The change in Segment Operating Profit of reportable segments can be summarized as follows (dollars in millions): Segment Operating Profit 2009 $ 891 Net effect of price and mix $ 5 Sales volume 7 Manufacturing and delivery 38 Operating expenses and other 7 Effects of changing foreign currency rates 16 Total net effect on Segment Operating Profit 73 Segment Operating Profit 2010 $ 964 Europe: Segment operating profit in Europe in 2010 was $324 million compared with $333 million in 2009, a decrease of $9 million, or 3%. The decline in segment operating profit was primarily due to pricing pressures in the region and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, partially offset by higher sales volumes and improved operating efficiencies. 34 Table of Contents North America: Segment operating profit in North America in 2010 was $275 million compared with $282 million in 2009, a decrease of $7 million, or 2%. The decrease in segment operating profit was primarily due to the lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher selling prices and footprint realignment savings. South America: Segment operating profit in South America in 2010 was $224 million compared with $145 million in 2009, an increase of $79 million, or 54%. The increase in segment operating profit was primarily due to the higher sales volumes, the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, and footprint optimization efforts. Asia Pacific: Segment operating profit in Asia Pacific in 2010 was $141 million compared with $131 million in 2009, an increase of $10 million, or 8%. The increase in segment operating profit was primarily due to the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Interest Expense Interest expense in 2010 was $249 million compared with interest expense of $222 million in 2009. The 2009 amount includes $5 million of additional interest charges for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees, net of a gain from the termination of interest rate swap agreements following the May 2009 tender for the 7.50% Senior Debentures due May 2010. Exclusive of these items, interest expense increased approximately $32 million. The increase was principally due to additional debt issued in 2010 to fund acquisitions. Interest Income Interest income for 2010 was $13 million compared to $18 million for 2009. The decrease was principally due to lower interest rates on the Companys cash and investments. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2010 was 30.4%, compared with 38.6% for 2009. The provision for 2010 included a net tax benefit of $24 million related to the reversal of a non U.S. valuation allowance offset by additional liability related to uncertain tax positions. The provisions for 2010 and 2009 included a continuing operation non cash tax benefit transferred from other income categories of $8 million and $48 million, respectively (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). Excluding the amounts related to items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations, the Companys effective tax rate for 2010 was 26.2% compared to 24.0% for 2009. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2010 was due to higher earnings generated in jurisdictions where the Company has higher effective tax rates. Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2010 was $42 million compared to $36 million for 2009. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests was $37 million in 2010 compared to $22 million in 2009. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests was reduced by $8 million in 2009 related to restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded during the year. Excluding this amount, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2010 increased $7 million compared with 2009. This increase was primarily a result of higher segment operating profit in the Companys South American segment in 2010. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests related to discontinued operations in 2010 was $5 million compared to $14 million in 2009. The decrease was due to 2010 only including a partial year of earnings from the Companys Venezuelan operations prior to 35 Table of Contents the expropriation in October 2010 and the unfavorable effects of the bolivar devaluation in 2010 compared to 2009. Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to the Company For 2010, the Company recorded earnings from continuing operations attributable to the Company of $258 million compared to $110 million for 2009. The after tax effects of the items excluded from Segment Operating Profit, the unusual tax items and the 2009 additional interest charges increased or decreased earnings in 2010 and 2009 as set forth in the following table (dollars in millions). Net Earnings Increase (Decrease) Description 2010 2009 Restructuring and asset impairment $ (11 ) $ (180 ) Acquisition related fair value inventory adjustments and restructuring, transaction and financing costs (27 ) Charge for currency remeasurement (17 ) Note repurchase premiums and write off of finance fees, net of interest rate swap gain (5 ) Tax benefit related to the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowance offset by additional liability related to uncertain tax positions 24 Non cash tax benefit transferred from other income categories 8 48 Charge for asbestos related costs (170 ) (180 ) Total $ (176 ) $ (334 ) Items Excluded from Reportable Segment Totals Retained Corporate Costs and Other Retained corporate costs and other for 2011 were $79 million compared with $89 million for 2010. Retained corporate costs and other for 2011 reflect higher marketing and pension expense compared to the prior year, offset by a reduction of management incentive compensation expense of approximately $15 million, approximately half of which was related to the impact of lower financial results in the current year and the other half related to the impact of changes in estimates on amounts expensed in previous periods. 2011 also benefited from higher equity earnings from the Companys ownership in a soda ash joint venture and higher earnings from the Companys global equipment sales business. Retained corporate costs and other for 2010 were $89 million compared with $67 million for 2009. The increased expense in 2010 was mainly attributable to increased employee benefit costs, primarily pension expense. Restructuring and Asset Impairments During 2011, the Company recorded charges totaling $112 million for restructuring and asset impairment. These charges reflect completed and planned furnace closures in Europe and Asia Pacific, as well as global headcount reduction initiatives. During 2010, the Company recorded charges totaling $13 million for restructuring and asset impairment. The charges reflect the completion of previously announced actions in North America and Europe related to the Companys strategic review of its global manufacturing footprint. 36  Table of Contents During 2009, the Company recorded charges totaling $207 million for restructuring and asset impairment. The charges reflect actions taken in Europe, North America and South America related to the Companys strategic review of its global manufacturing footprint. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Acquisition related fair value inventory adjustments and restructuring, transaction and financing costs The Company recorded charges in 2010 of $12 million for acquisition related fair value inventory adjustments. This charge was due to the accounting rules requiring inventory purchased in a business combination to be marked up to fair value, and then recorded as an increase to cost of goods sold as the inventory is sold. The Company also recorded charges in 2010 of $20 million for acquisition related restructuring, transaction and financing costs. Charge for Currency Remeasurement Due to Venezuelan government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country at the official rate, the Company remeasured certain bolivar denominated assets and liabilities held outside of Venezuela to the parallel market rate and recorded a charge of $18 million in 2009. Charge for Asbestos Related Costs The fourth quarter of 2011 charge for asbestos related costs was $165 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 charge of $170 million. These charges resulted from the Companys comprehensive annual review of asbestos related liabilities and costs. In each year, the Company concluded that an increase in the accrued liability was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims pending and expected to be filed during the several years following the completion of the comprehensive review. See "Critical Accounting Estimates" for further information. Asbestos related cash payments for 2011 were $170 million, a decrease of $9 million from 2010. Deferred amounts payable were approximately $18 million and $26 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During 2011, the Company received approximately 3,200 new filings and disposed of approximately 4,500 claims. As of December 31, 2011, the number of asbestos related claims pending against the Company was approximately 4,600. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet all asbestos related obligations on a short term and long term basis. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Charge for Goodwill Impairment During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company completed its annual impairment testing and determined that impairment existed in the goodwill of its Asia Pacific segment. Lower projected cash flows, principally in the segments Australian operations, caused the decline in the business enterprise value. The strong Australian dollar in 2011 resulted in many wine producers in the country exporting their wine in bulk shipments and bottling the wine closer to their end markets. This decreased the demand for wine bottles in Australia, which was a significant portion of the Companys sales in that country, and the Company expects this decreased demand to continue into the foreseeable future. Following a review of the valuation of the segments identifiable assets, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $641 million to reduce the reported of its goodwill. 37 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations On October 26, 2010, the Venezuelan government, through Presidential Decree No. 7.751, expropriated the assets of Owens Illinois de Venezuela and Fabrica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A., two of the Companys subsidiaries in that country, which in effect constituted a taking of the going concerns of those companies. Shortly after the issuance of the decree, the Venezuelan government installed temporary administrative boards who are in control of the expropriated assets. Since the issuance of the decree, the Company has cooperated with the Venezuelan government, as it is compelled to do under Venezuelan law, to provide for an orderly transition while ensuring the safety and well being of the employees and the integrity of the production facilities. The Company has been engaged in negotiations with the Venezuelan government in relation to certain aspects of the expropriation, including the compensation payable by the government as a result of its expropriation. On September 26, 2011, the Company, having been unable to reach an agreement with the Venezuelan government regarding fair compensation, commenced an arbitration against Venezuela through the World Banks International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. The Company is unable at this stage to predict the amount, or timing of receipt, of compensation it will ultimately receive. The Company considered the disposal of these assets to be complete as of December 31, 2010. As a result, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company presented the results of operations for its Venezuelan subsidiaries in the Consolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 as discontinued operations. The following summarizes the revenues and expenses of the Venezuelan operations reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Results of Operations for the periods indicated: Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 Net sales $ 129 $ 415 Manufacturing, shipping, and delivery (86 ) (266 ) Gross profit 43 149 Selling and administrative expense (5 ) (13 ) Research, development, and engineering expense (1 ) Interest income 11 Other expense 3 (36 ) Earnings from discontinued operations before income taxes 41 110 Provision for income taxes (10 ) (44 ) Earnings from discontinued operations 31 66 Loss on disposal of discontinued operations (331 ) Net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations (300 ) 66 Net earnings from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (5 ) (14 ) Net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to the Company $ (305 ) $ 52 The loss on disposal of discontinued operations of $331 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 included charges totaling $77 million and $260 million to write off the net assets and cumulative currency translation losses, respectively, of the Companys Venezuelan operations, net of a tax benefit of $6 million. The net assets were written off as a result of the deconsolidation of the subsidiaries due to the loss of control. The type or amount of compensation the Company may receive from the 38 Table of Contents Venezuelan government is uncertain and thus, will be recorded as a gain from discontinued operations when received. The cumulative currency translation losses relate to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar in prior years and were written off because the expropriation was a substantially complete disposal of the Companys operations in Venezuela. Capital Resources and Liquidity As of December 31, 2011, the Company had cash and total debt of $400 million and $4.0 billion, respectively, compared to $640 million and $4.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. A significant portion of the cash was held in mature, liquid markets where the Company has operations, such as the U.S., Europe and Australia, and is readily available to fund global liquidity requirements. The amount of cash held in non U.S. locations as of December 31, 2011 was $378 million. Current and Long Term Debt On May 19, 2011, the Companys subsidiary borrowers entered into the Secured Credit Agreement (the "Agreement"). The proceeds from the Agreement were used to repay all outstanding amounts under the previous credit agreement and the U.S. dollar denominated 6.75% senior notes due 2014. On June 7, 2011, the Company also redeemed the Euro denominated 6.75% senior notes due 2014. The Company recorded $25 million of additional interest charges for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees. At December 31, 2011, the Agreement included a $900 million revolving credit facility, a 170 million Australian dollar term loan, a $600 million term loan, a 116 million Canadian dollar term loan, and a &euro;141 million term loan, each of which has a final maturity date of May 19, 2016. At December 31, 2011, the Companys subsidiary borrowers had unused credit of $804 million available under the Agreement. The Agreement contains various covenants that restrict, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur certain liens, make certain investments, become liable under contingent obligations in certain defined instances only, make restricted junior payments, make certain asset sales within guidelines and limits, make capital expenditures beyond a certain threshold, engage in material transactions with shareholders and affiliates, participate in sale and leaseback financing arrangements, alter its fundamental business, and amend certain outstanding debt obligations. The Agreement also contains one financial maintenance covenant, a Leverage Ratio, that requires the Company to not exceed a ratio calculated by dividing consolidated total debt, less cash and cash equivalents, by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Agreement. The Leverage Ratio could restrict the ability of the Company to undertake additional financing or acquisitions to the extent that such financing or acquisitions would cause the Leverage Ratio to exceed the specified maximum of 4.0x. The Leverage Ratio does not conform to U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to amounts reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company uses the Leverage Ratio 39 Table of Contents to evaluate its liquidity and its compliance with its debt covenants. The Leverage Ratio for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was calculated as follows (dollars in millions): 2011 2010 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations $ (491 ) $ 295 Interest expense 314 249 Provision for income taxes 85 129 Depreciation 405 369 Amortization of intangibles 17 22 EBITDA 330 1,064 Adjustments in accordance with the Agreement: Proforma EBITDA for acquisitions 45 Restructuring and asset impairment 112 13 Acquisition related fair value inventory adjustments and restructuring, transaction and financing costs 32 Charges for asbestos related costs 170 79 Charge for goodwill impairment 641 Credit Agreement EBITDA $ 1,253 $ 1,233 Total Debt at December 31 $ 4,033 $ 4,278 Less cash (400 ) (640 ) Net debt $ 3,633 $ 3,638 Leverage Ratio (Net debt divided by Credit Agreement EBITDA) 2.9 x 2.9 x Failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default under the Agreement. In such an event, the Company could not request borrowings under the revolving facility, and all amounts outstanding under the Agreement, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. If an event of default occurs under the Agreement and the lenders cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under the Agreement to become due and payable, this would result in a default under a number of other outstanding debt securities and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to these debt securities. A default or event of default under the Agreement, indentures or agreements governing other indebtedness could also lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions. The Leverage Ratio also determines pricing under the Agreement. The interest rate on borrowings under the Agreement is, at the Companys option, the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Agreement. These rates include a margin linked to the Leverage Ratio. The margins range from 1.25% to 2.00% for Eurocurrency Rate loans and from 0.25% to 1.00% for Base Rate loans. In addition, a facility fee is payable on the revolving credit facility commitments ranging from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum linked to the Leverage Ratio. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Agreement at December 31, 2011 was 3.09%. As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and restrictions in the Agreement. In addition, the Company believes that it will remain in compliance and that its ability to borrow funds under the Agreement will not be adversely affected by the covenants and restrictions. Borrowings under the Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets, excluding real estate, of the Companys domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries. Borrowings are also secured by a pledge of intercompany debt and equity in most of the Companys domestic subsidiaries and stock of certain foreign subsidiaries. All borrowings under the agreement are guaranteed by substantially all domestic subsidiaries of the Company for the term of the Agreement. 40 Table of Contents The Company assesses its capital raising and refinancing needs on an ongoing basis and may enter into additional credit facilities and seek to issue equity and or debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets if market conditions are favorable. Also, depending on market conditions, the Company may elect to repurchase portions of its debt securities in the open market. The Company has a &euro;280 million European accounts receivable securitization program, which extends through September 2016, subject to annual renewal of backup credit lines. Information related to the Companys accounts receivable securitization program as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is as follows: 2011 2010 Balance (included in short term loans) $ 281 $ 247 Weighted average interest rate 2.41 % 2.40 % Cash Flows Free cash flow was $220 million for 2011 compared to $100 million for 2010. The Company defines free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operating activities less additions to property, plant, and equipment from continuing operations. Free cash flow does not conform to U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to the cash flow measures reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company uses free cash flow for internal reporting, forecasting and budgeting and believes this information allows the board of directors, management, investors and analysts to better understand the Companys financial performance. Free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 is calculated as follows (dollars in millions): 2011 2010 Cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 505 $ 600 Additions to property, plant, and equipment continuing (285 ) (500 ) Free cash flow $ 220 $ 100 Operating activities: Cash provided by continuing operating activities was $505 million for 2011 compared to $600 million for 2010. The decrease in cash flows from continuing operating activities was primarily due to lower earnings in the current year. The decrease in cash flows from continuing operating activities was also due to a decrease in dividends received from equity investments of $12 million, partially offset by decreases in cash paid for restructuring activities of $22 million, asbestos related payments of $9 million and a decrease in income taxes paid of $13 million. The Company also contributed $36 million more to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011 than it did in 2010, primarily due to the 2010 contributions being lower as a result of accelerated contributions made in 2009. During 2011, the Company contributed $59 million to its defined benefit pension plans, compared with $23 million in 2010. Based on current discount rates and asset returns, the Company expects that it will be required to make contributions to its U.S. plans in 2012, and that the contributions for all plans in 2012 will be approximately $95 million. The Company may elect to contribute amounts in excess of minimum required amounts in order to improve the funded status of certain plans. Investing activities: Cash utilized in investing activities was $426 million for 2011 compared to $1,314 million for 2010. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment from continuing operations during 2011 was $285 million compared with $500 million in the prior year. The decrease in capital spending was due to restructuring activities in North America and new furnace expansions in South America and Asia Pacific in 2010. Cash utilized in investing activities in 2011 included $144 million for acquisitions, primarily related to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest of the Companys 41 Table of Contents southern Brazil operation. Investing activities in 2010 included $817 million of cash paid to acquire glass manufacturing plants in Argentina, Brazil and China, and to invest in a joint venture with operations in Malaysia, Vietnam and China. Certain of the Companys older glass manufacturing plants in China are being encroached by strong urban growth. The local Chinese government entities have determined that the land on which some of these facilities reside should be returned to the government. The Company expects the compensation to be received from the Chinese government for the value of the land should offset most or all of the future capital spending required to rebuild the related capacity at alternate sites in China. The Company expects to complete the transfer of one facility and begin the construction of a new plant in 2012. Financing activities: Cash utilized in financing activities was $323 million for 2011 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $547 million for 2010. Financing activities in 2011 included additions to long term debt of approximately $1.5 billion, primarily related to borrowings under the Companys new bank credit agreement, and repayments of long term debt of approximately $1.8 billion, primarily related to the cancellation of the old bank credit agreement and the redemption of the senior notes due 2014. Financing activities in 2010 included the issuance of the exchangeable senior notes due 2015 and the &euro;500 million senior notes due 2020. During 2010, the Company also repaid the senior notes due 2013 and repurchased shares of its common stock for $199 million. The Company anticipates that cash flows from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the Agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs, debt service and other obligations on a short term (twelve months) and long term basis. Based on the Companys expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the Companys expected operating cash flow, the Company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims, and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos, will not have a material adverse effect upon the Companys liquidity on a short term or long term basis. 42 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The following information summarizes the Companys significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2011 (dollars in millions). Payments due by period Total Less than one year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Contractual cash obligations: Long term debt $ 3,706 $ 52 $ 308 $ 2,048 $ 1,298 Capital lease obligations 76 24 27 15 10 Operating leases 195 59 76 34 26 Interest(1) 1,069 205 380 281 203 Purchase obligations(2) 1,318 590 550 125 53 Pension benefit plan contributions 95 95 Postretirement benefit plan benefit payments(1) 289 20 39 38 192 Total contractual cash obligations $ 6,748 $ 1,045 $ 1,380 $ 2,541 $ 1,782 Amount of commitment expiration per period Total Less than one year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Other commercial commitments: Standby letters of credit $ 96 $ 96 Total commercial commitments $ 96 $ 96 (1)Amounts based on rates and assumptions at December 31, 2011. (2)The Companys purchase obligations consist principally of contracted amounts for energy and molds. In cases where variable prices are involved, current market prices have been used. The amount above does not include ordinary course of business purchase orders because the majority of such purchase orders may be canceled. The Company does not believe such purchase orders will adversely affect its liquidity position. The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement with taxing authorities may occur for its unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time the financial statements are issued. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates. 43  Table of Contents The impact of, and any associated risks related to, estimates and assumptions are discussed within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if applicable, where estimates and assumptions affect the Companys reported and expected financial results. The Company believes that accounting for property, plant and equipment, impairment of long lived assets, pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, and income taxes involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Property, Plant and Equipment The net carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment ("PP&E") at December 31, 2011 totaled $2,877 million, representing 32% of total assets. Depreciation expense during 2011 totaled $405 million, representing approximately 6% of total costs and expenses. Given the significance of PP&E and associated depreciation to the Companys consolidated financial statements, the determinations of an assets cost basis and its economic useful life are considered to be critical accounting estimates. Cost Basis PP&E is recorded at cost, which is generally objectively quantifiable when assets are purchased individually. However, when assets are purchased in groups, or as part of a business, costs assigned to PP&E are based on an estimate of fair value of each asset at the date of acquisition. These estimates are based on assumptions about asset condition, remaining useful life and market conditions, among others. The Company frequently employs expert appraisers to aid in allocating cost among assets purchased as a group. Included in the cost basis of PP&E are those costs which substantially increase the useful lives or capacity of existing PP&E. Significant judgment is needed to determine which costs should be capitalized under these criteria and which costs should be expensed as a repair or maintenance expenditure. For example, the Company frequently incurs various costs related to its existing glass melting furnaces and forming machines and must make a determination of which costs, if any, to capitalize. The Company relies on the experience and expertise of its operations and engineering staff to make reasonable and consistent judgments regarding increases in useful lives or capacity of PP&E. Estimated Useful Life PP&E is generally depreciated using the straight line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings each period over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by the Company, which may be less than its physical life. Managements assumptions regarding the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, product and process obsolescence, technical standards, and changes in market demand. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, technological advances, excessive wear and tear, or changes in customers requirements may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, the Company depreciates the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Changes in economic useful life assumptions did not have a material impact on the Companys reported results in 2011, 2010 or 2009. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Property, Plant, and Equipment The Company tests for impairment of PP&E whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. PP&E held for use in the Companys business is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which 44 Table of Contents cash flows can reasonably be identified, typically a geographic region. The Company evaluates the recoverability of property, plant, and equipment based on undiscounted projected cash flows, excluding interest and taxes. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset groups carrying amount exceeds its fair value. PP&E held for sale is reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Impairment testing requires estimation of the fair value of PP&E based on the discounted value of projected future cash flows generated by the asset group. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent managements best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include, among other things: industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, production costs and inflation. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. The Company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. Goodwill Goodwill at December 31, 2011 totaled $2.1 billion, representing 24% of total assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1 (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) using a two step process. Step 1 compares the business enterprise value ("BEV") of each reporting unit with its carrying value. The BEV is computed based on estimated future cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer. If the BEV is less than the carrying value for any reporting unit, then Step 2 must be performed. Step 2 compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. Any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value will be recorded as an impairment loss. The calculations of the BEV in Step 1 and the implied fair value of goodwill in Step 2 are based on significant unobservable inputs, such as price trends, customer demand, material costs, discount rates and asset replacement costs, and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company completed its annual impairment testing and determined that impairment existed in the goodwill of its Asia Pacific segment. Lower projected cash flows, principally in the segments Australian operations, caused the decline in the business enterprise value. The strong Australian dollar in 2011 resulted in many wine producers in the country exporting their wine in bulk shipments and bottling the wine closer to their end markets. This decreased the demand for wine bottles in Australia, which is a significant portion of the Companys sales in that country, and the Company expects this decreased demand to continue into the foreseeable future. Following a review of the valuation of the segments identifiable assets, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $641 million to reduce the reported value of its goodwill. The testing performed as of October 1, 2011, indicated a significant excess of BEV over book value for Europe, North America and South America. If the Companys projected future cash flows were substantially lower, or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital was substantially higher, the testing performed as of October 1, 2011, may have indicated an impairment of one or more of these reporting units and, as a result, the related goodwill may also have been impaired. However, less significant changes in projected future cash flows or the assumed weighted average cost of capital would not have indicated an impairment. For example, if projected future cash flows had been decreased by 5%, or if the weighted average cost of capital had been increased by 5%, or both, the resulting lower BEVs would still have exceeded the book value of each of these reporting unit. The Company will monitor conditions throughout 2012 that might significantly affect the projections and variables used in the impairment test to determine if a review prior to October 1 may be appropriate. If the results of impairment testing confirm that a write down of goodwill is necessary, then the Company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of 2012, or earlier if appropriate. In the event the Company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill, the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth. 45 Table of Contents Other Long Lived Assets Other long lived assets include, among others, equity investments and repair parts inventories. The Companys equity investments are non publicly traded ventures with other companies in businesses related to those of the Company. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company carries a significant amount of repair parts inventories in order to provide a dependable supply of quality parts for servicing the Companys PP&E, particularly its glass melting furnaces and forming machines. The Company evaluates the recoverability of repair parts inventories based on undiscounted projected cash flows, excluding interest and taxes, when factors indicate that impairment may exist. If impairment exists, the repair parts are written down to fair value. The Company continually monitors the carrying value of repair parts for recoverability, especially in light of changing business circumstances. For example, technological advances related to, and changes in, the estimated future demand for products produced on the equipment to which the repair parts relate may make the repair parts obsolete. In these circumstances, the Company writes down the repair parts to fair value. Pension Benefit Plans Significant Estimates The determination of pension obligations and the related pension expense or credits to operations involves significant estimates. The most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. The Company uses discount rates based on yields of high quality fixed rate debt securities at the end of the year. At December 31, 2011, the weighted average discount rate was 4.59% and 4.75% for U.S. and non U.S. plans, respectively. The Company uses an expected long term rate of return on assets that is based on both past performance of the various plans assets and estimated future performance of the assets. Due to the nature of the plans assets and the volatility of debt and equity markets, actual returns may vary significantly from year to year. The Company refers to average historical returns over longer periods (up to 10 years) in determining its expected rates of return because short term fluctuations in market values do not reflect the rates of return the Company expects to achieve based upon its long term investing strategy. For purposes of determining pension charges and credits in 2012, the Companys estimated weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 8.0% for U.S. plans and 6.2% for non U.S. plans compared to 8.0% for U.S. plans and 6.4% for non U.S. plans in 2011. The Company recorded pension expense from continuing operations of $47 million, $36 million, and $10 million for the U.S. plans in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, and $44 million, $37 million, and $35 million for the non U.S. plans from its principal defined benefit pension plans. The increase in pension expense in 2011 was principally a result of the amortization of prior period actuarial losses. Depending on currency translation rates, the Company expects to record approximately $90 million of total pension expense for the full year of 2012. Future effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance. For example, a one half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding the expected return on assets would result in a change of approximately $18 million in the pretax pension expense for the full year 2012. In addition, changes in external factors, including the fair values of plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities, could have a significant effect on the recognition of funded status as described below. For example, a one half percentage point change in the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities would result in a change of approximately $20 million in the pretax pension expense for the full year 2012. Recognition of Funded Status Generally accepted accounting principles for pension benefit plans require employers to adjust the assets and liabilities related to defined benefit plans so that the 46 Table of Contents amounts reflected on the balance sheet represent the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans. These funded status amounts are measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and actuarially calculated benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2011, the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss component of share owners equity was increased by $218 million ($226 million after tax attributable to non U.S. pension plans) to reflect a net decrease in the funded status of the Companys plans at that date. Contingencies and Litigation The Company believes that its ultimate asbestos related liability (i.e., its indemnity payments or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees) cannot reasonably be estimated. The Companys ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by, among other factors, the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the United States, the significant number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy, the magnitude and timing of co defendant bankruptcy trust payments, the inherent uncertainty of future disease incidence and claiming patterns, the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation, and the use of mass litigation screenings to generate large numbers of claims by parties who allege exposure to asbestos dust but have no present physical asbestos impairment. The Company continues to monitor trends that may affect its ultimate liability and continues to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the Company. The Company conducts a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs annually in connection with finalizing and reporting its annual results of operations, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review. If the results of an annual comprehensive review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is insufficient to cover its estimated future asbestos related costs, then the Company will record an appropriate charge to increase the accrued liability. The Company believes that a reasonable estimation of the probable amount of the liability for claims not yet asserted against the Company is not possible beyond a period of several years. Therefore, while the results of future annual comprehensive reviews cannot be determined, the Company expects the addition of one year to the estimation period will result in an annual charge. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company recorded a charge of $165 million to increase its accrued liability for asbestos related costs. This amount was lower than the 2010 charge of $170 million. The factors and developments that particularly affected the determination of the amount of the 2011 accrual included the following: (i) the rates and average disposition costs of new filings against the Company; (ii) the Companys successful litigation record; (iii) legislative developments and court rulings in several states; and (iv) the impact these and other factors had on the Companys valuation of existing and future claims. The Companys estimates are based on a number of factors as described further in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other litigation is pending against the Company, in many cases involving ordinary and routine claims incidental to the business of the Company and in others presenting allegations that are non routine and involve compensatory, punitive or treble damage claims as well as other types of relief. The Company records a liability for such matters when it is both probable that the liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Recorded amounts are reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes in the factors upon which the estimates are based, including additional information, negotiations, settlements and other events. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes as required by general accounting principles under which management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. This judgment includes estimating and analyzing historical and projected future operating 47 Table of Contents results, the reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and the ultimate outcome of uncertain income tax positions. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used for calculating income tax expense and potential differences in actual results from estimates could have a material impact on the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which the Company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is dependent upon historical profitability and future sources of taxable income including the effects of tax planning. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. Accordingly, evidence related to objective historical losses is typically given more weight than projected profitability. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets, where based on the weight of available evidence it is unlikely to realize those deferred tax assets.  ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Companys operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates, and changes in commodity prices, principally energy and soda ash. The Company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating energy prices. These instruments carry varying degrees of counterparty credit risk. To mitigate this risk, the Company has established limits on the exposure with individual counterparties and the Company regularly monitors these exposures. Substantially all of these exposures are with counterparties that are rated single A or above. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Earnings of operations outside the United States A substantial portion of the Companys operations are conducted by subsidiaries outside the U.S. The primary international markets served by the Companys subsidiaries are in Canada, Australia, China, South America (principally Colombia and Brazil), and Europe (principally Italy, France, The Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Poland). In general, revenues earned and costs incurred by the Companys major international operations are denominated in their respective local currencies. Consequently, the Companys reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the international markets in which the Companys subsidiaries operate. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the reported U.S. dollar value of local currency earnings generally decreases; when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the reported U.S. dollar value of local currency earnings generally increases. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company did not have any significant foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was the U.S. dollar. The Company does not hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to earnings of operations outside the United States. Borrowings not denominated in the functional currency Because the Companys subsidiaries operate within their local economic environment, the Company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with borrowings denominated in the 48 Table of Contents local currency to the extent practicable where debt financing is desirable or necessary. Considerations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans, tax implications, and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms. In those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency, this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. In those countries where the U.S. dollar is the designated functional currency, however, local currency borrowings expose the Company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the U.S. dollar. Available excess funds of a subsidiary may be redeployed through intercompany loans to other subsidiaries for debt repayment, capital investment, or other cash requirements. Generally, each intercompany loan is denominated in the lenders local currency giving rise to foreign currency exchange rate risk for the borrower. To mitigate this risk, the borrower generally enters into a forward exchange contract which effectively swaps the intercompany loan and related interest to its local currency. The Company believes the near term exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk of its foreign currency risk sensitive instruments was not material at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates applicable to the term loans under its Secured Credit Agreement (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). The Companys interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on net income and cash flow, while minimizing interest payments and expense. To achieve this objective, the Company regularly evaluates its mix of fixed and floating rate debt, and, from time to time, may enter into interest rate swap agreements. The following table provides information about the Companys interest rate sensitivity related to its significant debt obligations at December 31, 2011. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date. (dollars in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Fair Value at 12/31/2011 Long term debt at variable rate: Principal by expected maturity $ 76 $ 129 $ 206 $ 444 $ 329 $ 23 $ 1,207 $ 1,207 Avg. principal outstanding $ 1,169 $ 1,067 $ 899 $ 574 $ 188 $ 35 Avg. interest rate 3.09 % 3.09 % 3.09 % 3.09 % 3.09 % 3.09 % Long term debt at fixed rate: Principal by expected maturity $ 690 $ 600 $ 1,285 $ 2,575 $ 2,614 Avg. principal outstanding $ 2,575 $ 2,575 $ 2,575 $ 2,173 $ 1,510 $ 994 Avg. interest rate 6.36 % 6.36 % 6.36 % 7.20 % 7.14 % 7.28 % The Company believes the near term exposure to interest rate risk of its debt obligations has not changed materially since December 31, 2010. Commodity Price Risk The Company has exposure to commodity price risk, principally related to energy. In North America, the Company enters into commodity futures contracts related to forecasted natural gas requirements, the objectives of which are to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid for natural gas and the related volatility in cash flows. The Company continually evaluates the natural gas market and related price risk and periodically enters into commodity futures contracts in order to hedge a portion of its usage requirements. The majority of the sales volume in North America is tied to customer contracts that contain provisions that pass the price of natural gas to the customer. In certain of these contracts, the customer has the option of fixing the natural gas price component for 49 Table of Contents a specified period of time. At December 31, 2011, the Company had entered into commodity futures contracts covering approximately 5,100,000 MM BTUs, primarily related to customer requests to lock the price of natural gas. In Europe, the Company enters into fixed price contracts for a significant amount of its energy requirements. These contracts typically have terms of 12 months or less. The Company believes the near term exposure to commodity price risk of its commodity futures contracts was not material at December 31, 2011.
