ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Some of the statements contained and incorporated in this Form 10 K are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward looking statements relate to the anticipated financial performance, managements plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions and other matters. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements in various circumstances. The following discussion is intended to identify important factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, the information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and other statements contained or incorporated in this Form 10 K identified by words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "believe," "projection" or "goal." You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements. They are based on known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. Those factors may affect our operations, markets, products, services and prices. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with the forward looking statements, factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward looking statement include, among others, the following: . the effects of weather and other natural phenomena on sales and prices; . increased competition from other energy suppliers as well as alternative forms of energy; . the capital intensive nature of the Companys business; . further deregulation, or "unbundling" of the natural gas business; . competitive changes in the natural gas gathering, transportation and storage business resulting from deregulation, or "unbundling," of the natural gas business; . the profitability of assets or businesses acquired by the Company; . risks of marketing, trading, and hedging activities as a result of changes in energy prices and credit worthiness of counterparties; . economic climate and growth in the geographic areas in which the Company does business; . the uncertainty of gas and oil reserve estimates; . the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for natural gas, natural gas liquids, electricity, and crude oil; . the effects of changes in governmental policies and regulatory actions, including income taxes, environmental compliance, and authorized rates; . the results of litigation related to the Companys now terminated proposed acquisition of Southwest Gas Corporation (Southwest) or to the termination of the Companys merger agreement with Southwest; . the results of administrative proceedings and litigation involving the Oklahoma Corporation Commission and Kansas Corporation Commission; and . the other factors listed in the reports the Company has filed and may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are incorporated by reference. Other factors and assumptions not identified above were also involved in the making of the forward looking statements. The failure of those assumptions to be realized, as well as other factors, may also cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. 33 OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK The energy industry has undergone tremendous changes throughout the past decade. The Companys strategy has been and continues to be one of growth through acquiring assets that complement and strengthen each other, maximizing the earnings potential of existing assets through asset rationalization and consolidation and introducing regulatory initiatives that benefit the Company and its customers. The Company believes that the energy markets will continue to see deregulation, although it may be different than how certain markets have been deregulated to date. Furthermore, management believes that the natural gas and electricity markets will continue to converge and consolidate, while providing additional opportunities for growth. The Company also believes that demand for natural gas will increase due in part to the construction of a significant amount of gas fired electric generating plants necessary to maintain adequate supply in the marketplace. The Company will continue to focus on enhancing the earnings potential of its existing assets through acquiring assets that grow the Companys operations into new market areas and complement its existing asset base. In 2001, the Company expanded its trading capabilities by marketing and trading energy from its 300 megawatt, gas fired electric generating plant designed to capture the spark spread premium, which is the value added by converting natural gas to electricity, primarily during peak demand periods. OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS Acquisitions and Capital Expenditures The Company increased its common ownership interest in Magnum Hunter Resources, Inc. (MHR) from approximately nine percent to over twenty one percent in early 2001 through conversion of shares and redemption of MHR preferred stock owned by the Company to shares of MHR common stock as well as exercising warrants. As a result, the Company began accounting for the MHR investment using the equity method of accounting. In December, 2001, MHR and Prize Energy Corp. (Prize) announced plans to merge which will reduce the Companys ownership to approximately 11 percent. Assuming the merger is completed in 2002, the Company will begin accounting for the investment in MHR as an available for sale security and, accordingly, mark the investment to fair value through other comprehensive income. The MHR investment and related income is reported in the Other segment. During 2001, the Company completed construction of the $120 million Spring Creek Power Plant, located in Logan County, Oklahoma, and began operations in mid 2001. Four gas powered turbines will provide electricity during peak demand periods. The Company spent approximately $42.3 million in 2001, $58.7 million in 2000, $13.4 million in the four months ended December 31, 1999 and $3.7 million in the year ended August 31, 1999 constructing the 300 megawatt plant In 2000, the Company made two significant asset acquisitions that greatly enhanced its Gathering and Processing, Transportation and Storage, and Marketing and Trading segments. The combined acquisitions included natural gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 1.6 Bcf/d, approximately 19,000 miles of gathering and transmission lines, natural gas storage facilities with a combined capacity of approximately 10 Bcf and contributed to a significant increase in trading. The acquisition of these assets demonstrates execution of the Companys strategy of growing through acquisition of assets that complement and strengthen each other. Regulatory KGS was successful in obtaining temporary approval of weather normalization. KGS also obtained permanent approval of the WeatherProof Bill Program that had been a temporary program. The Company believes that the successful implementation of these initiatives and programs will reduce the impact of weather on earnings and customer bills. 34 The OCC issued an order denying ONG the right to collect $34.6 million in unrecovered gas costs incurred while serving customers during the 2000/2001 winter season. The Company appealed this order to the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked the OCC to stay the provisions of this order pending the outcome of the Companys appeal. The OCC subsequently approved the Companys request to stay this order, which will allow ONG to collect the $34.6 million, subject to refund should the Company ultimately lose the case. Although the Company will continue to assert its legal rights, it is hopeful that a resolution of this issue can be negotiated. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and contained within this report. Certain amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosure must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. Therefore, the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. We believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others as discussed below. Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities The Company engages in price risk management activities. As discussed in Note A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under "Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities", energy trading contracts are accounted for using mark to market accounting. Forwards, swaps, options, and energy transportation and storage contracts utilized for trading activities are reflected at fair value as assets and liabilities from price risk management activities in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of these assets and liabilities are affected by the actual timing of settlements related to these contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of price movements. Changes in fair value are recognized in net revenues in the consolidated statement of income. Market prices used to fair value these assets and liabilities reflect managements best estimate considering various factors including closing exchange and over the counter quotations, time value and volatility underlying the commitments. Market prices are adjusted for the potential impact of liquidating the Companys position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions. For further information, see Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Regulation The Companys intrastate transmission pipelines and distribution operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the OCC, KCC and TRC. Certain other transportation activities of the Company are subject to regulation by the FERC. Allocation of costs and revenues to accounting periods for rate making and regulatory purposes may differ from bases generally applied by non regulated operations. Such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered to be generally accepted accounting principles for regulated utilities provided that there is a demonstrable ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates. During the rate making process, regulatory commissions may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred. This allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery. This causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates. Although no further unbundling of services is anticipated, should this occur, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for deferred recognition and, accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. 35 Impairments The Company assesses for impairment of long lived assets when indicators of impairment are present. An impairment is recognized if the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount. Impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. Fair values are based on discounted future cash flows or information provided by sales and purchases of similar assets. See further discussion of the Companys significant accounting policies in Note A of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS Years Ended Year Ended December 31, August 31, 2001 2000 1999 Financial Results (Thousands of Dollars) Operating revenues $ 6,803,146 $ 6,642,858 $ 1,838,949 Cost of gas 5,894,361 5,845,726 1,213,478 Net revenues 908,785 797,132 625,471 Operating costs 456,243 319,848 280,045 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 157,310 143,351 129,704 Operating income $ 295,232 $ 333,933 $ 215,722 Other income, net $ 876 $ 18,475 $ 10,500 Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle $ (3,508) $ 3,449 $ Income tax 1,357 (1,334) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ (2,151) $ 2,115 $ Operating Results A full year of operations of the assets acquired in March and April of 2000 contributed to increased net revenues, despite lower energy prices in the latter part of 2001, and increased operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization. The Companys ability to successfully execute its transportation and storage arbitrage strategy also continued to favorably impact operating results. The impact of the OCC ruling related to the recovery of gas costs from the 2000/2001 winter reduced operating income by $34.6 million and the impact of the Enron bankruptcy reduced operating income by $37.4 million in 2001. The Company is pursuing all opportunities to settle the OCC matter. Included in Other income, net for 2001 is $8.1 million in income from equity investments including MHR and $3.7 million of ongoing litigation costs associated with the terminated acquisition of Southwest Gas Corporation. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2001 is the result of changes in estimates of prior year tax liabilities recorded in the third quarter. The Companys operating results during 2000 increased compared to 1999 due to the acquisitions, greater price volatility in the U.S. natural gas markets, adoption of mark to market accounting for its trading activities, and higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased primarily due to the acquisitions. Included in Other income, net for 2000 is the $26.7 million gain on the sale of Indian Basin, $13.4 million in income from equity investments and preferred dividends received and $13.7 million of previously deferred transaction and ongoing litigation costs associated with the terminated acquisition of Southwest Gas Corporation. Interest expense increased in 2001 compared to 2000 as a result of increased debt primarily due to financing of acquisitions and increased working capital including unrecovered purchased gas costs. The Company has interest rate swaps in place that reduced interest expense by $5.3 million in 2001 from what the expense would have been with fixed interest rates. See Note C in the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of interest rate swaps. 36 Transition Period Operating Results Four Months Ended December 31, 1999 1998 Financial Results (Thousands of Dollars) Operating revenues $ 806,478 $ 580,701 Cost of gas 587,681 384,682 Net revenues 218,797 196,019 Operating costs 92,002 86,145 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 43,227 41,736 Operating income $ 83,568 $ 68,138 Other income,net $ 2,396 $ 4,993 Operating results were strong despite warmer than normal weather. While the four month periods ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 were both warmer than normal, the Company used derivative instruments for the 1999/2000 heating season to reduce the effect of weather variances. During the Transition Period, these derivative instruments offset much of the margin variances caused by weather. This revenue was recorded in the Other segment. The operations from the assets acquired in 1999 also favorably impacted operating results. Increased borrowing, primarily due to acquisitions in fiscal 1999, resulted in increased interest expense for the four months ended December 31, 1999. Gains on sales of assets of $5.0 million were included in Other Income during the four month period ended December 31, 1998. MARKETING AND TRADING Operational Highlights The Companys marketing and trading operation purchases, stores, markets, and trades natural gas to both the wholesale and retail sectors in 28 states. The Company has mid continent region storage positions and transport capacity of 1 Bcf/d that allows for trade from the California border, throughout the Rockies, to the Chicago city gate. With total storage capacity of 73 Bcf, withdrawal capability of 2.1 Bcf/d and injection capability of 1.4 Bcf/d, the Company has direct access to all regions of the country with great flexibility in capturing margins associated with price volatility in the energy markets. The Company continues to enhance its strategy of focusing on higher margin business which includes providing reliable service during peak demand periods through the use of storage. 37 Years Ended Year Ended December 31, August 31, 2001 2000 1999 Financial Results (Thousands of Dollars) Gas sales $ 4,906,556 $ 4,658,787 $ 821,890 Cost of gas 4,804,795 4,595,199 789,955 Gross margin on gas sales 101,761 63,588 31,935 Other revenues 1,668 2,894 3,508 Net revenues 103,429 66,482 35,443 Operating costs 31,488 14,321 9,069 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 597 887 503 Operating income $ 71,344 $ 51,274 $ 25,871 Other income, net $ 259 $ $ Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle $ $ 3,449 $ Income tax (1,334) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ $ 2,115 $ Operating Results The increase in Marketing and Tradings gross margins on gas sales in 2001 compared to 2000 is attributable to its ability to capture higher margins by arbitraging regional price volatility through the use of its storage and transportation capacity. The Company was also able to capture wider winter/summer spreads on stored volumes and benefited from falling prices that positively impacted fuel costs associated with its long term transportation contracts while sales volumes decreased slightly. The Companys gross margin included income recognized from mark to market accounting of approximately $35 million and $24 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Increased operating costs are due primarily to increased personnel costs required to operate the expanded base of marketing and trading activities acquired in 2000. Also, the Enron bankruptcy resulted in a $22.9 million increase in cost of gas and a $14.5 million increase in operating costs, totaling a $37.4 million negative impact on operating results for 2001. The Companys claim against Enron in bankruptcy is estimated to be $74.0 million. The increase in gross margins on gas sales in 2000 compared to 1999 is primarily attributable to the increased volumes achieved through the acquisition in 2000. The acquisition significantly increased the segments commercial control of storage and transportation positions, primarily in the mid continent, Rocky Mountain and Texas regions, thereby providing more leverage for its marketing and trading capabilities. Increased price volatility during 2000 compared to 1999 also contributed to increased gross margin on gas sales by providing greater marketing and trading opportunities. Gross margin on gas sales was also favorably impacted by the change in accounting principle requiring the Marketing and Trading segment to mark energy trading contracts to fair value. Increased operating costs in 2000 compared to 1999 are primarily attributable to increased personnel costs resulting from the acquisition coupled with increases in overall personnel to support the expanded base of marketing and trading activities. Operating costs also increased due to higher costs relating to technological enhancements necessary to support these activities. 38 Years Ended Year Ended December 31, August 31, 2001 2000 1999 Operating Information Natural gas volumes (MMcf) 977,602 990,033 389,241 Gross margin ($/Mcf) $ 0.10 $ 0.06 $ 0.08 Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 1,184 $ 815 $ 448 Total assets (Thousands) $ 1,369,220 $ 3,035,227 $ 269,444 Marketing and Trading sales volumes averaged 2.7 Bcf/d in 2001 and 2000 and 1.1 Bcf/d in 1999. The increase in sales volumes compared to 1999 is primarily due to the acquisition in 2000 and increased trading activity around the Companys increased storage and transportation capacity. Gross margin per Mcf improved in 2001 compared to 2000 as the Company has now fully integrated its mid continent marketing and trading base and is successfully executing its strategies for transportation and use of storage that focus on capturing higher margin sales. Gross margin per Mcf decreased in 2000 compared to 1999 as a result of higher baseload sales resulting from the acquisition of marketing and trading operations in 2000. The Company has since integrated those acquired contracts that complement its business strategy while terminating those contracts that do not. The decrease in total assets at December 31, 2001 compared to 2000 is primarily attributable to a decrease of $823.3 million in accounts receivable and a decrease of $782.4 million in price risk management assets which represent the fair value of the Companys commodity and derivative trading contracts and storage inventory. Both were the result of decreased natural gas prices. The increase in total assets at December 31, 2000, compared to 1999 is primarily attributable to $1.8 billion in price risk management assets and a $1.0 billion increase in accounts receivable due to increased marketing and trading activities and increased natural gas prices. Transition Period Operating Results Four months ended December 31, 1999 1998 Financial Results (Thousands of Dollars) Gas sales $ 382,650 243,776 Cost of gas 371,556 233,810 Gross margin on gas sales 11,094 9,966 Other revenues 399 2,470 Net revenues 11,493 12,436 Operating costs 3,344 2,730 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 242 103 Operating income $ 7,907 $ 9,603 The increase in gross margin is attributable to increased throughput and a more extensive use of storage. The use of storage has allowed the Company to concentrate on the day to day market and take advantage of volatility in that market. Emphasis on base load market had been reduced. Increased sales volumes are primarily due to the expanded niche business into Texas and the west coast. The decrease in Other revenues is due to the recovery of prior period costs in the four months ended December 31, 1998. The increase in operating costs is related to leasing storage. 39 Four months ended December 31, 1999 1998 Operating Information Natural gas volumes (MMcf) 138,070 116,309 Gross margin ($/Mcf) $ 0.08 $ 0.08 Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 9 $ 605 Total assets (Thousands) $ 287,375 $ 141,733 Price Risk Management To mitigate the financial risks arising from fluctuations in both the market price and transportation costs of natural gas, OEMT manages its portfolio of contracts and the Companys assets in order to maximize value, minimize the associated risks and provide overall liquidity. In doing so, OEMT uses price risk management instruments, including swaps, options, futures and physical commodity based contracts to manage exposures to market price movements. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. GATHERING AND PROCESSING Operational Highlights The Gathering and Processing segment currently owns and operates or leases and operates 25 gas processing plants and has an ownership interest in four additional gas processing plants which it does not operate. Six operated plants are temporarily idle. The total processing capacity of plants operated and the Companys proportionate interest in plants not operated by the Company is 2.2 Bcf/d, of which 0.150 Bcf/d has been idled temporarily. A total of over 19,300 miles of gathering pipelines support the gas processing plants. Years Ended Year Ended December 31, August 31, 2001 2000 1999 Financial Results (Thousands of Dollars) Natural gas liquids and condensate sales $ 587,842 $ 536,470 $ 52,757 Gas sales 635,569 426,364 23,032 Gathering, compression, dehydration and processing fees and other revenues 91,406 73,879 8,001 Cost of Sales 1,125,196 812,701 52,479 Net revenues 189,621 224,012 31,311 Operating costs 116,853 90,501 11,207 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 29,201 22,692 3,562 Operating income $ 43,567 $ 110,819 $ 16,542 Other income, net $ (178) $ 26,460 $ Operating Results A full year of operation of assets acquired in early 2000 contributed to increased revenues and cost of sales for 2001 compared to 2000. However, decreased processing spreads and lower natural gas prices resulted in lower net revenues for 2001. In the first quarter of 2001, there were negative processing spreads for the first time in more than 10 years and inter month volatility during the year was the greatest it has been at any time during that same 10 year period. The overall processing spread for 2001 was approximately 75% of the 10 year average of $1.29 per MMBtu. During the year, both crude oil and natural gas prices fell from $29.33 per barrel and $9.98 per MMBtu to $18.00 per barrel and $1.83 per MMBtu, respectively. The downturn of the economy reduced the demand for many NGL products, particularly ethane, which is a major component of plastic products. Additionally, record high inventories in natural gas and other petroleum products, such as propane, along with significantly warmer than normal temperatures across North America during the heating season lowered demand for natural gas, home heating oil and propane causing weaker than expected prices in 2001. 40 Increased operating costs and depreciation, depletion, and amortization were also the result of a full year of operation for the assets acquired. Net revenues increased in 2000 compared to 1999 due to the assets acquired in early 2000 and a full year of operation of assets acquired in early 1999. The average NGL price per gallon increased significantly in 2000. Fee based revenues increased in 2000 compared to 1999 as a result of the acquisitions in 2000. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization increased for 2000 compared to 1999 as a result of the acquisitions and the related goodwill. The increase in operating costs is primarily attributable to increased personnel and related benefit costs resulting from the additional employees gained through the acquisitions and additional lease expense resulting from the Bushton lease, which was acquired from KMI in 2000. Other income for 2000 consists of the gain on the sale of the Companys interest in the Indian Basin processing plant. Years Ended Year Ended December 31, August 31, 2001 2000 1999 Gas Processing Plants Operating Information Total gas gathered (MMMBtu/D) 1,572 1,329 229 Total gas processed (MMMBtu/D) 1,420 1,206 187 Natural gas liquids sales (MBbls) 27,719 23,984 4,559 Natural gas liquids produced (Bbls/d) 74,238 68,999 7,642 Gas sales (MMBtu) 142,828 115,180 10,534 Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 51,442 $ 32,383 $ 8,557 Total assets (Thousands) $ 1,322,438 $ 1,507,546 $ 343,133 Volumes of natural gas gathered and processed, NGL sales, NGLs produced and gas sales increased for 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to a full year of operations of the assets acquired in 2000, which provided increased processing and fractionation capacity. Average NGL prices for 2001 decreased compared to 2000, which offset the impact of the increased volumes. The Conway OPIS composite NGL price based on the Companys NGL product mix for 2001 decreased 12 percent from $0.531/gal to $0.465/gal. Average natural gas prices increased for the same period despite decreases during the last half of 2001. The gas price for the mid continent region increased 11 percent in 2001 from an average of $3.74/MMBtu to an average of $4.15/MMBtu. For 2000, the increase over 1999 for total gas gathered, gas processed, NGL sales, NGLs produced and gas sales is primarily due to the acquisitions in early 2000 and a full year of operations from the acquisition in April 1999. The increase in capital expenditures from 2000 to 2001 and from 1999 to 2000 is primarily due to the acquisitions. Additional increases in 2000 and 2001 are related to the Company consolidating its plants in Texas to lower operating costs and optimize recoveries. The decrease in total assets from 2000 to 2001 is due to decreases in cash and accounts receivable due to decreased prices. The increase in total assets from 1999 to 2000 is primarily attributable to a $619.3 million increase in property, plant and equipment acquired in the 2000 acquisitions and a $99.1 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in accounts receivable is due to both increased business and increased prices. Risk Management At December 31, 2001, the Gathering and Processing segment had a portion of its natural gas costs and NGL production hedged. The Company also used derivative instruments during 2001 to minimize risk associated with price volatility and expects to utilize such instruments during 2002.

Operating costs and depreciation also increased due to the additional assets and the cost of operating those assets. Average NGL price per gallon increased as prices continued to experience an upward correction from the abnormally low prices prevalent throughout much of 1998 and early 1999. Four Months Ended December 31, 1999 1998 Gas Processing Plants Operating Information Total gas gathered (MMMBtu/D) 481 127 Total gas processed (MMMBtu/D) 397 115 Natural gas liquids sales (MBbls) 3,007 927 Natural gas liquids produced (Bbls/d) 7,022 7,642 Gas sales (MMBtu) 10,643 2,303 Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 14,613 $ 974 Total assets (Thousands) $ 368,904 $45,709 TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE Operational Highlights The Transportation and Storage segment represents the Companys intrastate transmission pipelines and natural gas storage facilities. The Company has five storage facilities in Oklahoma, two in Kansas and three in Texas with a combined working capacity of approximately 58 Bcf, of which 8 Bcf is idled. The Companys intrastate transmission pipelines operate in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and are regulated by the OCC, KCC and TRC, respectively. 42 Years Ended Year Ended December 31, August 31, 2001 2000 1999 Financial Results (Thousands of Dollars) Transportation revenues $ 117,999 $ 94,112 $ 78,720 Storage revenues 37,645 38,464 27,763 Gas sales and other revenues 23,326 35,882 1,402 Cost of fuel and gas 49,626 42,876 4,975 Net revenues 129,344 125,582 102,910 Operating costs 52,497 44,785 28,919 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 19,190 18,639 13,852 Operating income $ 57,657 $ 62,158 $ 60,139 Other income, net $ 2,578 $ 3,240 $ 6,495 Operating results Transportation revenues increased for 2001 compared to 2000 due to higher retained fuel from a full year of operation of assets acquired in early 2000. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in volumes transported associated with reduced demand for irrigation due to higher natural gas prices, making gas powered irrigation uneconomical for many farmers, and warmer than normal temperatures during the fourth quarter of 2001. The expiration of gas sales contracts acquired in early 2000 resulted in a decrease of $4.6 million in gas sales revenue in 2001. While revenues from unaffiliated companies decreased as gas sales contracts expired, revenues from transportation contracts replaced the margin generated by those expired gas sales contracts. The increase in cost of fuel in 2001 compared to 2000 is due to a full year of operation of the assets acquired in 2000 and increased gas prices. Operating costs increased due to higher ad valorem taxes, labor and other operating costs associated with a full year of operation of the assets acquired in 2000. Depreciation, depletion and amortization also increased in 2001 due to the 2000 acquisitions. For 2000 compared to 1999, transportation revenues increased due to higher retained fuel despite reduced tariff rates paid by an affiliate for transportation services. Storage revenues increased due to increased capacity of approximately 10 Bcf resulting from the acquisition of storage facilities in 2000. Although storage revenues increased due to the acquisition, overall storage volumes as a percent of working capacity were down significantly because summer/winter pricing differentials were lower than in prior years. Gas sales and other revenues and cost of gas increased due to gas sales contracts acquired in 2000 and leasing fees related to a pipeline acquired in 2000. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily as a result of increased plant operating costs and personnel costs resulting from acquisitions. Other income, net represents income from equity investments in Potato Hills and Sycamore Gathering. In 1999, approximately $5.0 million of gains on sales of assets were also included. Years Ended Year Ended December 31, August 31, 2001 2000 1999 Operating Information Volumes transported (MMcf) 538,221 557,052 348,397 Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 35,911 $ 37,701 $ 32,618 Total assets (Thousands) $ 797,331 $ 661,894 $ 373,742 Volumes of natural gas transported decreased in 2001 due a return to normal weather as compared to 2000. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in volumes transported due to operating the assets acquired in 2000 for a full year. The increase in volumes transported in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily driven by the acquisitions in 2000 and colder weather. 43 Total assets increased in 2001 due to increases in cash and accounts receivables. Total assets increased in 2000 due to increases in property, plant and equipment and in accounts receivable primarily due to the acquisitions. Regulatory Initiatives In a May 2000 OCC Order, the Companys transportation assets in Oklahoma included in the Transportation and Storage segment became a separate regulated utility from the Distribution segment. Pursuant to a July 1999 OCC Order, the Companys gathering and storage assets and related services in Oklahoma were removed from utility regulation effective November 1, 1999 resulting in gathering and storage assets being removed from rate base. ONG issued bids for upstream and downstream services in the fall of 1999 with bids awarded in the spring of 2000. Through the bidding process, the Transportation and Storage segment retained 96 percent of ONGs transportation services. With unbundling of transportation services and deregulation of gathering and storage, the Company is now competing for business at market based rates. During 2001, an OCC cause related to an affiliate, ONG, also involved the Marketing and Trading segment and the Transportation and Storage segment. In this cause, Enogex, Inc. requested a rebid of gas supply and transportation service. If OEMT had lost the gas supply bid previously awarded, OEMT would no longer need companies in the Transportation and Storage segment to transport the gas supply. The OCC declined to order a rebid. An application has been filed with the KCC requesting approval to transfer a portion of the transportation assets in the Market Center to KGS. The operation of these assets is regulated by the KCC. The Market Center transportation system provides access to the major natural gas producing areas in Kansas intersecting with nine intra/interstate pipelines at 18 interconnect points, four processing plants, and approximately three producing fields effectively allowing gas to be moved throughout the state. With the transfer of these assets, KGS will be able to provide itself with firm transportation service.

Decreased transportation rates paid by an affiliate resulted in decreased transportation revenues for the Transition Period compared to the same period in 1998. 44 Four Months Ended, December 31, 1999 1998 Operating Information Volumes transported (MMcf) 117,055 115,970 Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 5,837 $ 13,163 Total assets (Thousands) $ 437,561 $ 507,573 DISTRIBUTION Operational Highlights The Distribution segment provides natural gas distribution services in Oklahoma and Kansas. The Companys operations in Oklahoma are conducted through ONG that serves residential, commercial, and industrial customers and leases pipeline capacity. The Companys operations in Kansas are conducted through KGS that serves residential, commercial, and industrial customers. The Distribution segment serves about 80 percent of the population of Oklahoma and about 71 percent of the population of Kansas. ONG and KGS are subject to regulatory oversight by the OCC and KCC, respectively. Years Ended Year Ended December 31, August 31, 2001 2000 1999 Financial Results (Thousands of Dollars) Gas sales $ 1,434,184 $ 1,198,604 $ 848,813 Cost of gas 1,157,575 896,660 530,489 Gross margin 276,609 301,944 318,324 PCL and ECT Revenues 55,206 59,205 58,037 Other revenues 21,578 16,128 17,100 Net revenues 353,393 377,277 393,461 Operating costs 230,137 211,629 219,945 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 69,159 67,717 75,443 Operating income $ 54,097 $ 97,931 $ 98,073 Other income, net $ (946) $ $ Operating Results Gas sales and cost of gas increased in 2001 compared to 2000 due to a higher weighted average cost of gas. Although prices of natural gas decreased in the latter part of 2001 from their historically high levels during the winter of 2000/2001, those costs were still billed and recovered throughout most of 2001. Since gas costs are recognized as they are recovered from the ratepayer, the mechanism providing recovery of gas costs and regulatory actions in Oklahoma delayed much of the recovery of high gas costs in late 2000 until 2001 and, accordingly, delayed recognition of the costs. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a $34.6 million charge to cost of gas as a result of the OCCs order limiting ONGs recovery of gas purchase expense related to the 2000/2001 winter. This resulted in a decrease in gross margin on gas sales in 2001 compared to 2000. KGS gross margin increased $3.0 million in 2001 over 2000 due to impact of the Weather Normalization Program offsetting the warmer weather. ECT revenues decreased $3.4 million in 2001 from 2000 due largely to lower volumes delivered to electric generation customers due to milder summer weather. Gross margin on gas sales decreased in 2000 compared to fiscal 1999, primarily due to warmer weather in Kansas which impacted margins by $15.4 million during a period in which the Company did not have weather normalization and reduced tariff rates resulting from unbundling in Oklahoma. The impact of these decreases on gross margin was partially offset by $5.3 million resulting from additional "As Available" gas sales. 45 Operating cost for 2001 increased over 2000 due to additional bad debt expense of $19.2 million incurred as a result of the increased natural gas prices during the winter of 2000/2001. This was partially offset by a reduction in operating costs due to the continuation of a successful cost containment program. The decrease in operating costs in 2000 compared to 1999 resulted from a cost containment program and decreased costs resulting from fewer employees. The decrease in depreciation, depletion, and amortization is the result of the extension of estimated useful lives for assets located in Oklahoma. The revised estimated lives were approved by the OCC in a rate order granted in May 2000 that reduced depreciation expense and revenues by approximately $10.5 million annually for Oklahoma assets and transferred certain transportation assets from the Distribution segment to the Transportation and Storage segment. The same order directed ONG to assume responsibility for certain customer service lines and allowed ONG to defer the costs associated with the service lines until addressed in the next rate case filing. Years Ended Year Ended December 31, August 31, 2001 2000 1999 Gross Margin per Mcf Oklahoma Residential $2.71 $2.76 $3.04 Commercial $2.18 $1.97 $2.47 Industrial $1.34 $1.09 $1.23 Pipeline capacity leases $0.30 $0.27 $0.25 Kansas Residential $2.45 $2.44 $2.44 Commercial $1.82 $1.91 $1.81 Industrial $1.43 $1.85 $2.28 End use customer transportation $0.61 $0.63 $0.49 The decrease in Kansas commercial and industrial gross margins per Mcf for 2001 from 2000 results from the full year impact of the tariff rate reduction that took effect in July 2000. Oklahomas gross margin per Mcf increased for commercial and industrial due to adjustments to gas purchase expense and a deferral of revenues from a line loss rider from 2000 to 2001. A full year of tariff rate reductions in 2001 partially offset this increase and resulted in a decrease to gross margin per Mcf for residential. The decrease in Oklahomas gross margin per Mcf for residential, commercial and industrial customers in 2000 compared to 1999 is primarily due to decreased tariff rates resulting from unbundling in Oklahoma. The increase in Kansas gross margin per Mcf for commercial customers is largely due to the Company reducing its minimum capacity requirements for customers to become eligible for ECT services pursuant to a regulatory order. This resulted in several commercial customers becoming ECT customers and the remaining commercial customers are low volume, high margin customers. The decrease in Kansas industrial gross margin per Mcf is primarily due to a tariff rate reduction. 46 Years Ended Year Ended December 31, August 31, 2001 2000 1999 Operating Information Average Number of Customers Oklahoma 794,008 784,746 748,445 Kansas 642,436 633,698 656,761 Total 1,436,444 1,418,444 1,405,206 Customers per employee Oklahoma 639 586 546 Kansas 579 555 510 Capital Expenditures (Thousands) $ 129,937 $ 124,983 $ 98,685 Total Assets (Thousands) $ 1,688,670 $ 2,007,351 $ 1,722,381 The consolidation of the KGS Oklahoma regulated service with ONG in 2000 resulted in the transfer of approximately 35,000 customers from Kansas to Oklahoma. The Companys capital expenditure program includes expenditures for extending service to new areas, modifying customer service lines, increasing system capabilities, and general replacements and betterments. It is the Companys practice to maintain and periodically upgrade facilities to assure safe, reliable, and efficient operations. The capital expenditure program included $22.4 million, $21.4 million, and $19.8 million for new business development in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Years Ended Year ended December 31, August 31, 2001 2000 1999 Volumes (MMcf) Gas sales Residential 102,976 107,154 105,566 Commercial 40,578 40,713 41,398 Industrial 4,101 5,582 5,575 Wholesale 31,060 34,781 34,846 Total volumes sold 178,715 188,230 187,385 PCL and ECT 136,975 158,100 177,701 Total volumes delivered 315,690 346,330 365,086 The decrease in volumes sold is due to warmer weather in 2001 compared to 2000 and, for industrial and wholesale sales, the movement of some customers to the PCL program. The decrease in PCL and ECT volumes is primarily due to some customers that use significant quantities of gas in their manufacturing process suspending manufacturing operations in late 2000 and early 2001 due to historically high natural gas prices. These decreases were partially offset by the Company reducing its minimum capacity requirements for customers to become eligible for PCL and ECT services pursuant to a regulatory order. The reduction of the minimum requirements allowed more low volume customers to be added to the customer base. Regulatory Initiatives The extraordinarily cold winter of 2000/2001 produced a number of regulatory initiatives. The OCC issued an order denying ONG the right to collect $34.6 million in outstanding gas costs incurred while serving customers during the 2000/2001 winter season. The Company appealed this order to the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked the OCC to stay the provisions of this order pending the outcome of the Companys appeal. The OCC subsequently approved the Companys request to stay this order allowing ONG to collect the $34.6 million, subject to refund should the Company ultimately lose the case. ONEOK took a charge against fourth quarter earnings as a result of the Commissions order. Although the Company will continue to assert its legal rights, it is hopeful that a resolution of this issue can be negotiated. 47 ONG continues to take an active role in response to the OCCs Notice of Inquiry regarding the use of physical and financial instruments to hedge against fuel procurement volatility. ONG exercised provisions contained in a number of its gas supply contracts that allow the Company to fix the price of a portion of its gas supply. ONG fixed the price of approximately 40% of its anticipated 2001/2002 winter gas supply deliveries. The Company received approval from the OCC to create a Voluntary Fixed Price pilot program that will enable its general sales customers to fix the gas cost portion of their bill for a specified winter period. The program is being initiated as a means of providing customers with a means of controlling their 2002/2003 gas bills. During 2001, the KCC issued an Order extending the time period for which gas service disconnection during inclement weather conditions cannot be made. Due to the extension of the time period restricting disconnections, delinquent KGS customers were allowed to continue gas service, thus increasing uncollectible amounts. Higher gas costs in the 2000/2001 heating season also contributed to the increased uncollectible amounts. KGS and other distribution companies in Kansas filed a joint application with the KCC seeking approval to recover the additional uncollectible amounts incurred during the 2000/2001 heating season until reviewed in the next rate case. The KCC approved the deferral allowing the companies to seek recovery of the extraordinary uncollectible account levels experienced in the 2000/2001 winter. KGS expects to file a rate case in late 2002. No accounting treatment has yet been determined. During 2000, the KCC issued an Order allowing KGS to recover additional costs of its gas purchase hedging program established to protect the price paid by customers for gas purchases. The KCC approved KGSs WeatherProof Bill Program that had been a temporary program. This plan allows customers, at their discretion, to fix their monthly payment. The KCC also granted KGS weather normalization in December 2000 that prevents weather related revenue fluctuations.

A reduction in revenues due to the gathering and storage assets being removed from rate base, as previously discussed, offset part of that increase. PCL and ECT revenues and volumes decreased primarily due to the loss of three customers and the effect of warm weather including the temporary shut down of two power plants served by the Distribution segment. The volume decrease was partially offset by an increase in rates. Operating costs decreased due to reductions in labor expense, employee benefits, and other operating efficiencies. The Distribution segment continues its strategy of increased operational efficiency while maintaining quality customer service. 48 Four Months Ended December 31, 1999 1998 Gross Margin per Mcf Oklahoma Residential $2.88 $2.96 Commercial $2.48 $2.51 Industrial $1.16 $1.27 Pipeline capacity leases $0.25 $0.23 Kansas Residential $2.76 $2.85 Commercial $2.07 $1.86 Industrial $1.97 $2.70 End use customer transportation $0.60 $0.48 Four Months Ended December 31, 1999 1998 Operating Information Number of customers 1,435,647 1,421,280 Customers per employee 546 527 Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 34,167 $ 24,636 Total assets (Thousands) $ 1,776,273 $ 1,804,631 Four Months Ended December 31, 1999 1998 Volumes (MMcf) Gas sales Residential 31,908 31,244 Commercial 11,415 12,005 Industrial 1,795 1,684 Wholesale 12,062 13,150 Total volumes sold 57,180 58,083 PCL and ECT 49,634 63,824 Total volumes delivered 106,814 121,907 Certain costs to be recovered through the rate making process have been recorded as regulatory assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (Statement 71). Total regulatory assets resulting from this deferral process are approximately $222.4 million for the Distribution segment. Although no further unbundling of services is anticipated, should this occur, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for following Statement 71, and accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. PRODUCTION Operational Highlights The Companys strategy is to concentrate ownership of hydrocarbon reserves in the mid continent region in order to add value not only to its existing production operations but also to the related gathering and processing, marketing, transportation, and storage businesses. Accordingly, the Company focuses on exploitation activities rather than exploratory drilling. As a result of a growth strategy through acquisitions and developmental drilling, the number of wells the Company operates has increased. In its role as operator, the Company controls operating decisions that impact production volumes and lifting costs. The Company continually focuses on reducing finding costs and minimizing production costs. 49 During 2001, the Company acquired approximately $1.5 million in gas and oil properties. Through the Companys developmental drilling program, 155 wells were drilled during 2001 compared to 103 wells completed in 2000, an increase of more than 50 percent. Risk Management The volatility of energy prices has a significant impact on the profitability of this segment As of December 31, 2001, 11 percent of anticipated 2002 proved developed producing well volumes, totaling approximately 2.3 Bcf, was hedged at an average price of $3.17 per Mcf. In 2001, 74 percent of proved developed producing well volumes, totaling approximately 17 Bcf, was hedged at an average price of $3.60 per Mcf.

The Company also benefited from higher oil and gas production in 2001 compared to 2000. Operating costs increased in 2001 due to higher production taxes resulting from higher oil and gas revenues. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased in 2001 compared to 2000 due primarily from higher production, along with a slightly higher depletion rate. Net revenues increased in 2000 compared to 1999, due to higher natural gas and oil prices. The Company hedged the majority of its production in 2000. The impact of slightly higher commodity prices realized by the Company on revenues was partially offset by natural declines in production that was not replaced by new production. Operating costs increased in 2000 as compared with 1999 as a result of higher production taxes. Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased in 2000 compared to 1999 due to decreased production and a lower average depletion rate resulting from low finding costs on current discoveries. Other income, net in 2001 primarily represents the gain from the sale of the Companys 40 percent interest in K. Stewart. 50 Years Ended Years Ended December 31, August 31, 2001 2000 1999 Operating Information Proved reserves Gas (MMcf) 232,967 254,721 254,102 Oil (MBbls) 4,511 4,339 4,197 Production Gas (MMcf) 27,578 26,746 27,773 Oil (MBbls) 493 400 460 Average realized price (a) Gas (Mcf) $ 3.91 $ 2.28 $ 2.12 Oil (Bbls) $ 24.89 $ 21.43 $ 13.56 Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 55,974 $ 34,035 $ 16,046 Total assets (Thousands) $ 321,720 $ 308,041 $ 310,715 (a) The average realized price, above, reflects the impact of hedging activities. The Production segment added 9.8 Bcfe of net reserves in 2001 after adjustments, including 20.8 Bcfe proved developed, 8.0 Bcfe proved behind pipe, 12.5 Bcfe proved undeveloped, offset by 31.5 Bcfe of downward revisions of proved reserve due to lower year end 2001 prices and the resulting shorter economic life of some wells and the reduction of proved undeveloped reserve estimates as they were converted to proved developed reserves. Production for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 30.5 Bcfe. Capital expenditures above primarily relate to the drilling program, which consisted of drilling costs of approximately $53.2 million, $32.8 million, and $13.7 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

Gas and oil prices for the Transition Period also increased compared to the same period in 1998. Operating costs also increased, compared to 1998, due to the Company operating and owning an interest in an increased number of wells.

POWER Operational Highlights The Company created the Power segment in January 2001 to include the operating results of the electric generating plant constructed by the Company. The 300 megawatt electric power plant is located adjacent to one of the Companys natural gas storage facilities and is configured to supply electric power during peak periods with four gas powered turbine generators manufactured by General Electric. The Companys strategy is to capture the value added by converting natural gas to electricity, the spark spread premium, during peak demand periods. The plant began operations in mid 2001. The construction of this power plant complements the Companys strategy of maximizing earnings capacity of existing assets and exploring new opportunities that are expected to have a positive impact on earnings. Years Ended Year Ended December 31, August 31, 2001 2000 1999 Financial Results (Thousands of Dollars) Power sales $ 28,092 $ $ Cost of power 21,234 Gross margin on power sales 6,858 Operating costs 1,358 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 2,014 Operating income $ 3,486 $ $ Other income, net $ (6) $ $ Operating Results Power sales consist primarily of peaking sales rather than baseload contracts. Gross margin on power sales for 2001 were less than that which would be expected had the plant been in operation for a full year. Cooler weather during the summer of 2001 and low power prices both negatively impacted gross margins. The majority of the cost of power is generated by the peaking plant rather than purchased from unaffiliated companies. 52 Years Ended Year Ended December 31, August 31, 2001 2000 1999 Operating Information Power volumes (MMwh) 467 Gross margin ($/MMwh ) $ 14.69 $ $ Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 42,302 $ 58,697 $ 3,748 Total assets (Thousands) $ 122,404 $ 77,426 $ 4,047 Prior to January 1, 2001, capital expenditures for the construction of the peak electric generating plant had been included in the Marketing and Trading segment. These capital expenditures have been reclassified and included in the Power segment for the periods shown in this report. Capital expenditures for the four months ended December 31, 1999 were $13.4 million. Primarily all capital expenditures incurred through 2001 relate to the construction of the plant. Price Risk Management The Companys strategy is to capture market volatility in the spark spread premium. In doing so, the Power segment uses price risk management instruments, including swaps, options, futures and physical commodity based contracts to manage exposures to market price movements. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES A part of the Companys strategy has been and continues to be growth through acquisitions that strengthen and complement existing assets. The Company anticipates capital expenditures for 2002, exclusive of any acquisitions that may be made, to be approximately $242 million, which is less than previous years. The Company has relied primarily on a combination of operating cash flow and borrowings from a combination of commercial paper issuances, lines of credit, and capital markets for its liquidity and capital resource requirements. The Company expects to continue to use these sources for its liquidity and capital resource needs on both a short and long term basis. Financing is provided through the Companys commercial paper program, long term debt and, if needed, through a revolving credit facility. Other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuance of equity, asset securitization and sale/leaseback of facilities. The Company currently has a $500 million shelf registration in effect covering debt securities, including convertible debt and common stock. During 2001, capital expenditures were financed through operating cash flows and long term debt. The Companys credit rating may be affected by a material change in financial ratios or a material adverse event. The most common criteria for assessment of the Companys credit rating are the debt to capital ratio, pre tax and after tax interest coverage and liquidity. If the Companys credit rating were downgraded, the interest rates on the commercial paper would increase, therefore, increasing the Companys cost to borrow funds. In the event, that the Company was unable to borrow funds under the commercial paper program, the Company has access to an $850 million revolving credit facility. In addition, downgrades in the Companys credit rating could impact the Marketing and Trading segments ability to do business by requiring the Company to post margins with the few counterparties with which the Company has a Credit Support Annex within its International Swaps and Derivatives Association Agreement. 53 The Company has reviewed its commercial paper agreement, trust indentures, building leases, Bushton equipment leases, and marketing, trading and risk contracts and no rating triggers were identified. Rating triggers are defined as provisions that would create an automatic default or acceleration of indebtedness based on a change in the Companys credit rating. The revolving credit agreement does contain a provision that would cause the cost to borrow funds to increase based on the amount borrowed under this agreement if the Companys credit rating is negatively adjusted. This credit agreement also contains a default provision based on a material adverse change of the Company, but an adverse rating change is not defined as a default or material adverse change. The Company currently does not borrow funds under this agreement. The Company also has no guarantees of debt or other commitments to unaffiliated parties. The OCC staff filed an application on February 1, 2001 to review the gas procurement practices of ONG in acquiring its gas supply for the 2000/2001 heating season to determine if they were consistent with least cost procurement practices and whether the Companys decisions resulted in fair, just and reasonable costs being borne by its customers. An order issued on November 20, 2001 denied the recovery of a portion of the Companys unrecovered purchased gas cost account related to the unrecovered gas costs from the 2000/2001 winter effective December 1, 2001, leaving ONG with an estimated $34.6 million in unrecovered gas costs . The Company appealed this order to the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked the OCC to stay the provisions of this order pending the outcome of the Companys appeal. The OCC subsequently approved the Companys request to stay the order. The stay allows ONG to continue recovery of this $34.6 million in gas costs subject to refund if the Oklahoma Supreme Court ultimately rules against the Company. The Company believes that decisions made by the Company were prudent based upon the facts and circumstances existing at the time the decisions were made, which is the standard applicable to the proceeding as stated by the OCC. The Company will defend itself vigorously; however, the Company has taken a charge of $34.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of this order. This charge is recorded as an increase in gas purchase expense in the Distribution segment. During 2001, the Company put in place a stock buyback plan for up to 10 percent of its capital stock. The program authorizes the Company to make purchases of its common stock on the open market with the timing and terms of purchases and the number of shares purchased to be determined by management based on market conditions and other factors. The purchased shares are held in treasury and available for general corporate purposes, funding of stock based compensation plans, resale at a future date, or retirement. Purchases are financed with short term debt or are made from available funds. At December 31, 2001, the Company had not purchased any stock under the plan. The Company is subject to commodity price volatility. Significant fluctuations in commodity price in either physical or financial energy contracts may impact the Companys overall liquidity due to the impact the commodity price change has on items such as the cost of gas held in storage, recoverability and timing of regulated natural gas costs, increased margin requirements, collectibility of certain energy related receivables and working capital. The Company believes that its current commercial paper program and debt capacity is adequate to meet liquidity requirements from commodity price volatility. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS Operating Cash Flows In 2001, the changes in cash flows provided by operating activities primarily reflect changes in working capital accounts, deferred income taxes and price risk management assets and liabilities. The increase in deferred income taxes, a non cash item, is due to accelerated depreciation in 2001. The increase in price risk management assets and liabilities is primarily due to $35 million in mark to market income, which is a non cash item, and an increase in the Marketing and Trading segments gas in storage, which is included in price risk management assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The level of gas held in storage is higher at December 31, 2001 compared to December 31, 2000 due to warmer weather in 2001. Cash flow from operating activities was positively impacted in the current year due to the reduction of accounts receivable, which was partially offset by increased cash used for payment of accounts payable and gas in storage and reduced recovery of unrecovered purchased gas costs. Receivables and payables were higher than normal at December 31, 2000, due to higher gas prices and the integration of the businesses acquired in 2000. 54 In 2000, the changes in cash flow provided by operating activities primarily reflect changes in working capital accounts and an increase in assets and liabilities in price risk management activities. The significant changes in working capital accounts, including accounts receivable, gas in storage, accounts payable and deferred credits and other liabilities is primarily a result of the acquisitions and the increase in operations resulting from those acquisitions in 2000 and historically higher gas prices. The increase in price risk management activities is due to the adoption of mark to market accounting in 2000. Investing Cash Flows Cash paid for capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $341.6 million. This includes approximately $42.3 million for the construction of the electric generating plant. For the year ended December 31, 2000, capital expenditures were $311.4 million, which included $58.7 million for the construction of the electric generating plant. In 2001, the Company was reimbursed by an unaffiliated company for approximately $14 million of the costs incurred to construct a pipeline in the Transportation and Storage segment. Due to regulatory treatment, this amount is recorded as a deferred credit in the balance sheet and amortized to income. The Company also received approximately $7.9 million related to the sale of assets in the Production segment. Acquisitions in 2001 include $14.5 million of purchase price adjustments, which resulted in an increase to goodwill adjustments, relating to the Kinder Morgan acquisitions. The increase in capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the same period one year ago is primarily attributable to increased costs of sustaining a higher asset base due to the acquisitions in 2000. Cash used in investing activities increased in 2000 due to the acquisition of KMI and Dynegy. The increase in capital expenditures is related to the construction of the electric generating plant and recurring capital expenditures necessary to adequately maintain existing assets. Financing Cash Flows The Companys capitalization structure is 42 percent equity and 58 percent long term debt at December 31, 2001, compared to 48 percent equity and 52 percent long term debt at December 31, 2000. At December 31, 2001, $1.7 billion of long term debt was outstanding. As of that date, the Company could have issued $1,064.5 million of additional long term debt under the most restrictive provisions contained in its various borrowing agreements. The Board of Directors has authorized up to $1.2 billion of short term financing to be procured as necessary for the operation of the Company. The Company has an $850 million Revolving Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A. and other financial institutions with a maturity date of June 27, 2002. This credit facility is primarily used to support the commercial paper program. At December 31, 2001, $599 million of commercial paper was outstanding, which includes approximately $28 million of temporary investments and $275 million used to purchase natural gas that was injected into storage. At March 8, 2002, $413 million of commercial paper was outstanding, which includes approximately $118 million of temporary investments and $165 million used to purchase natural gas that was injected in to storage. In April 2001, the Company issued a $400 million, ten year, fixed rate note to refinance short term debt. In July 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swaps on this debt with a term equal to the term of the notes. The interest rate under these swaps resets periodically based on the three month London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the six month LIBOR at the reset date. In October 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to lock in the interest rates for each reset period under the swap agreements through the first quarter of 2003. In December 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swaps on a total of $200 million in fixed rate long term debt through the term of the note. The interest rate under these swaps resets periodically based on the six month LIBOR at the reset date. The average interest rate of the $600 million in notes is 6.971 percent. Under the current swap agreements, the average interest rate of the notes is an all in LIBOR rate of approximately 3.516 percent. The all in LIBOR rate refers to the average LIBOR rate plus or minus the ONEOK basis spread for all swaps. The swaps resulted in approximately $5.3 million of interest rate savings in 2001. 55 On July 18, 2001, the Company filed a "shelf" registration statement on Form S 3 pursuant to which the Company may offer debt securities and shares of the Companys common stock in one or more offerings with a total initial offering price of up to $500 million. On December 28, 2001, the Company filed a Post Effective Amendment with the intent to allow the Company to offer convertible debt under this existing shelf registration. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table discloses the Companys contractual obligations to make future payments under the Companys current debt agreements, operating lease agreements and fixed price contracts. For further discussion of the debt and operating lease agreements, see Notes I and K, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter (Thousands of Dollars) Long term debt $ 1,744,160 $ 250,000 $ 10,000 $ 50,000 $ 360,000 $ 310,000 $ 764,160 Notes payable 599,106 599,106 Operating leases 284,821 33,042 25,137 24,567 27,372 40,683 134,020 Storage contracts 32,039 15,433 6,282 3,236 3,150 3,150 788 Firm transportation contracts 39,657 11,717 5,916 4,502 3,872 3,470 10,180 Purchase commitments, rights of way and other 15,788 3,190 2,711 2,642 2,597 2,475 2,173 Total Contractual Obligations $ 2,715,571 $ 912,488 $ 50,046 $ 84,947 $ 396,991 $ 359,778 $ 911,321 Long term debt as reported in the consolidated balance sheets includes unamortized debt discount and the mark to market effect of interest rate swaps. Operating leases and purchase commitments, rights of way and other included approximately $0.9 million and $1.7 million for 2007, respectively, of annual commitments but are not included in the above table beyond 2007 due to the impracticality of calculating the future commitment. The Distribution segment is party to fixed price transportation contracts; however, the costs associated with these contracts are recovered through rates as allowed by the applicable regulatory agency and are excluded from the above table. TRADING ACTIVITIES Forwards, swaps, options, and energy transportation and storage contracts utilized for trading activities are reflected at fair value as assets and liabilities from price risk management activities in the consolidated balance sheets. The amounts include the cost of gas in storage, option premiums and the mark to market component (fair value). The following is a detail of the fair value component of the price risk management assets and liabilities, which result from the Marketing and Trading segments energy trading portfolio. (Thousands of Dollars) Net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2000 $ 24,219 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (28,580) Fair value of new contracts when entered into during the period 81,026 Changes in fair values attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions Other changes in fair value (1) (17,053) Net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2001 $ 59,612 (1) Other changes in fair value primarily relate to a charge to expense for unrealized gains associated with swaps and options with Enron as a result of Enrons bankruptcy filing. 56 The net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2001 includes energy trading contracts accounted for under mark to market accounting. The net fair value of contracts outstanding includes the effect of settled energy contracts and current period charges resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of price movements on the fair value of price risk management assets and liabilities attributable to the Marketing and Trading segments activities. The following is a detail of the Marketing and Trading segments maturity of energy trading contracts based on heating injection and withdrawal periods from April through March. This maturity schedule is consistent with the Marketing and Trading segments trading strategy. The Marketing and Trading segment has contracted over 40 Bcf of storage with an affiliate, which is excluded from outstanding fair value at December 31, 2001, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Fair Value of Contracts at December 31, 2001 Matures Matures Matures Matures Total through through through after fair Source of Fair Value March 2003 March 2006 March 2008 March 2008 value (Thousands of Dollars) Prices actively quoted (1) $ (22,627) $ (1,603) $ $ $ (24,230) Prices provded by other external sources (2) $ 124,474 913 (4,149) (1,567) $ 119,671 Prices based on models and other valuation models (3) $ (61,564) 30,509 4,065 (8,839) $ (35,829) Total $ 40,283 $ 29,819 $ (84) $ (10,406) $ 59,612 (1) Prices actively quoted values are derived from energy market price quotes from national commodity trading exchanges that primarily trade future and option commodity contracts. (2) Prices provided by other external sources values are obtained through energy commodity brokers or electronic trading platforms, whose primary service is to match up willing buyers and sellers of energy commodities. Because of the vast energy broker network, energy price information by location is readily available. (3) Prices based on models and other valuation models values include primarily natural gas storage and transportation capacity contracted by OEMT. Values derived in this category utilize market price information from the aforementioned categories as well as other modeling assumptions that include, among others, assumptions for liquidity, credit, time value and other external attributes. Values attributable to storage models are determined on a heating injection/withdraw model. 57 The following table details OEMTs financial and commodity risk from fixed price transactions: Investment Below Investment Grade Credit Grade Credit Quality (1) Quality (Thousands of Dollars) Gas and electric utilities $ 44,361 $ 1,084 Financial institutions (14,739) Oil and gas producers (13,046) (7,044) Industrial and commercial 12,631 3,819 Other (448) (263) Total 28,759 (2,404) Credit and other reserves (320) (755) Net value of fixed price transactions $ 28,439 $ (3,159) (1) Investment grade is primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings along with consideration of cash prepayments, cash managing, standby letters of credit and parent company guarantees. Included in Investment Grade are counterparties with a minimum Standard and Poors or Moodys rating of BBB or Baa3, respectively. Related Party Transactions KGS has a shared service agreement with Western, which is the holder of the Companys preferred stock. The shared services include call center backup, meter readings, customer billing operations and customer service. KGS paid Western approximately $4.9 million in 2001 related to this shared service agreement. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no off balance sheet special purpose entities or asset securitization. Enron Certain of the financial instruments discussed in Note C of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements have Enron North America as the counterparty. Enron Corporation and various subsidiaries, including Enron North America (Enron), filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on December 3, 2001. The Company has provided an allowance for forward financial positions and also established an allowance for uncollectible accounts relating to previously settled financial and physical positions with Enron at December 31, 2001. The Company estimates its claim against Enron to be approximately $74 million. Although the ultimate resolution of any claims ONEOK may have against Enron cannot be determined at this time, the Company believes any future losses would have an immaterial effect on the Companys financial position, cash flows and results of operations. The filing of the voluntary bankruptcy proceeding by Enron created a possible technical default related to various financing leases tied to the Companys Bushton gas processing plant in south central Kansas. The Company acquired the Bushton gas processing plant and related leases from Kinder Morgan in April 2000. Kinder Morgan had previously acquired the plant and leases from Enron. Enron is one of three guarantors of these Bushton plant leases; however, the Company is the primary guarantor. In January 2002, the Company was granted a waiver on the possible technical default related to these leases. The Company will continue to make all payments due under these leases. 58 Uncollectible Amounts During 2001, the KCC issued an Order extending the time period for which gas service disconnection during inclement weather conditions cannot be made. Due to the extension of the time period restricting disconnections, delinquent KGS customers were allowed to continue gas service, thus increasing uncollectible amounts. Higher gas costs in the 2000/2001 heating season also contributed to the increased uncollectible amounts. KGS and other distribution companies in Kansas filed a joint application with the KCC seeking approval to recover the additional uncollectible amounts incurred during the 2000/2001 heating season until reviewed in the next rate case. The KCC approved the deferral allowing the companies to seek recovery of the extraordinary uncollectible account levels experienced in the 2000/2001 winter. KGS expects to file a rate case in late 2002. No accounting treatment has yet been determined. Southwest Litigation In connection with the now terminated proposed acquisition of Southwest Gas Corporation (Southwest), the Company is party to various lawsuits. The Company and certain of its officers, as well as Southwest and certain of its officers, and others have been named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by Southern Union Company (Southern Union). The Southern Union allegations include, but are not limited to, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act violations and improper interference in a contractual relationship between Southwest and Southern Union. The original claim asked for $750 million damages to be trebled for racketeering and unlawful violations, compensatory damages of not less than $750 million and rescission of the Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement, punitive damages and injunctive relief. On June 29, 2001, the Company filed Motions for Summary Judgment. On September 26, 2001, the Court entered an order that, among other things, denied the Motions for Summary Judgment by the Company on Southern Unions claim for tortious interference with a prospective relationship with Southwest; however, the Courts ruling limited any recovery by Southern Union to out of pocket damages and punitive damages. The Company expects to file a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking a dismissal of this single remaining claim and for punitive damages. Based on discovery at this point, the Company believes that Southern Unions out of pocket damages potentially recoverable at trial, exclusive of legal fees and expenses, are less than $1.0 million. Southwest filed a lawsuit against the Company and Southern Union alleging, among other things, fraud and breach of contract. Southwest is seeking damages in excess of $75,000. In an order dated January 4, 2002, the Court denied Southwests Motion for Partial Summary Judgment in its favor on its claims against the Company, granted in part the Companys Motion for Summary Judgment against Southwest, and denied the Companys Motion for Summary Judgment in part with respect to Southwests claims for fraud in the inducement and fraud. Based on discovery at this point, the Company believes that Southwests actual damages potentially recoverable at trial, exclusive of legal fees and expenses, are less than $5.5 million. The lawsuits described above have been consolidated for purposes of trial. The Court has entered an order setting the cases for jury trial on October 15, 2002. Two substantially identical derivative actions were filed by shareholders against members of the Board of Directors of the Company for alleged violation of their fiduciary duties to the Company by causing or allowing the Company to engage in certain fraudulent and improper schemes related to the planned merger with Southwest for alleged waste of corporate assets. These two cases were consolidated into one case. Such conduct allegedly caused the Company to be sued by both Southwest and Southern Union, which exposed the Company to millions of dollars in liabilities. The plaintiffs seek an award of compensatory and punitive damages and costs, disbursements and reasonable attorney fees. The Company and its Independent Directors and officers named as defendants filed Motions to Dismiss the action for failure of the plaintiffs to make a pre suit demand on the Companys Board of Directors. In addition, the Independent Directors and certain officers filed Motions to Dismiss the actions for failure to state a claim. On February 26, 2001, the action was stayed until one of the parties notifies the Court that a dissolution of the stay is requested. 59 Except as set forth above or in the Legal Proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss, if any, associated with these matters. If substantial damages were ultimately awarded, it could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The Company is defending itself vigorously against all claims asserted by Southern Union and Southwest and all other matters relating to the now terminated proposed acquisition of Southwest. For more information, see Legal Proceedings. Hutchinson Litigation Two separate class action lawsuits have been filed against the Company in connection with the natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers that occurred in Hutchinson, Kansas in January 2001. Although no assurances can be given, management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. ONEOK and its subsidiaries are being represented by their insurance carrier in these cases. The Company is vigorously defending itself against all claims. For more information, see Legal Proceedings. Environmental The Company has 12 manufactured gas sites located in Kansas, which may contain potentially harmful materials that are classified as hazardous material. Hazardous materials are subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. A consent agreement with the KDHE presently governs all future work at these sites. The terms of the consent agreement allow the Company to investigate these sites and set remediation priorities based upon the results of the investigations and risk analysis. The prioritized sites will be investigated over a period of time as negotiated with the KDHE. Through December 31, 2001, the costs of the investigations and risk analysis related to these manufactured gas sites have been immaterial. Although remedial investigation and interim clean up has begun on four sites, limited information is available about the sites. Managements best estimate of the cost of remediation ranges from $100,000 to $10 million per site based on a limited comparison of costs incurred to remediate comparable sites. These estimates do not give effect to potential insurance recoveries, recoveries through rates or from third parties. The KCC has permitted others to recover remediation costs through rates. It should be noted that additional information and testing could result in costs significantly below or in excess of the amounts estimated above. To the extent that such remediation costs are not recovered, the costs could be material to the Companys results of operations and cash flows depending on the remediation done and number of years over which the remediation is completed. In January 2001, the Yaggy storage facility, located in Hutchison, Kansas, was idled following natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers. There are no known long term environmental effects from the Yaggy storage facility, however, the Company continues to perform tests in cooperation with the KDHE. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" (Statement 141), Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (Statement 142), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (Statement 143). In October, 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" (Statement 144). Statement 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. Statement 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of Statement 142. The Company adopted the provisions of Statement 141 effective July 1, 2001, and Statement 142 effective January 1, 2002. In connection with the Companys adoption of Statement 142, the Company is required to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill, including equity method goodwill, is impaired as of the date of adoption. Any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the Companys 2002 statement of earnings. 60 As of December 31, 2001, the Company has unamortized goodwill in the amount of $113.9 million. In addition, the Company has approximately $30.1 million of goodwill related to its equity investments. The entire amount will be subject to the transition provisions of Statement 142. Amortization expense related to goodwill was $4.4 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective January 1, 2002, with the adoption of Statement 142. In accordance with provisions of Statement 142, the Company will complete its analysis of goodwill for impairment no later than June 30, 2002. Statement 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Statement 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Statement 144 retains the requirement to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale. Statement 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of Statements 143 and 144 on its financial condition and results of operations. 61 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Management The Company, substantially through its nonutility segments, is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations and to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and power prices. Market risk refers to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in commodity energy prices. The Companys primary exposure arises from fixed price purchase or sale agreements which extend for periods of up to 48 months, gas in storage inventories utilized by the marketing and trading operation, and anticipated sales of natural gas and oil production. To a lesser extent, the Company is exposed to risk of changing prices or the cost of intervening transportation resulting from purchasing gas at one location and selling it at another (hereinafter referred to as basis risk). To minimize the risk from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, the Company uses commodity derivative instruments such as futures contracts, swaps and options to manage market risk of existing or anticipated purchase and sale agreements, existing physical gas in storage, and basis risk. The Company adheres to policies and procedures that limit its exposure to market risk from open positions and monitors market risk exposure. The Company has from time to time used weather derivative swaps to manage the risk of fluctuations in heating degree days (HDD) during the heating season. Under the weather derivative swap agreements, the Company receives a fixed payment per degree day below the contracted normal HDD and pays a fixed amount per degree day above the contracted normal HDD. The swaps contain a contract cap that limits the amount either party is required to pay. At December 31, 2001, the Company is not a party to any weather derivative swaps. KGS uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of some anticipated gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect their customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural gas. At December 31, 2001, KGS had derivative instruments in place to hedge the cost of gas purchases for 6,500 MMMbtu. For further discussion of trading activities and models and assumptions used in the trading activities see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Also, see Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Rate Risk The Company is subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates in the normal course of business due to the Company utilizing variable rate debt. The Company manages interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate swaps. In July 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swaps on a total of $400 million in fixed rate long term debt. The interest rate under these swaps resets periodically based on the three month LIBOR or the six month LIBOR at the reset date. In October 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to lock in the interest rates for each reset period under the swap agreements through the first quarter of 2003. In December 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swaps on a total of $200 million in fixed rate long term debt. At December 31, 2001, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates would result in an annual $4.4 million change in interest costs related to short term and floating rate debt based on principal balances outstanding at these dates. At December 31, 2000 the Company had no interest rate swaps. Value at Risk Disclosure of Market Risk ONEOK measures entity wide market risk in its trading, price risk management, and its non trading portfolios using value at risk (VAR). The quantification of market risk using VAR provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance, to determine risk targets and set position limits. The use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation. ONEOK relies on VAR to determine the potential reduction in the trading and price risk management portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period. 62 ONEOKs VAR exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized for its trading and price risk management portfolio of derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and gas in storage assuming hypothetical movements in commodity market assumptions with no change in positions and are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. VAR does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur because actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices, operating exposures and timing thereof, and the changes in the Companys trading and price risk management portfolio of derivative financial instruments and physical contracts. At December 31, 2001, the Companys estimated potential one day favorable or unfavorable impact on future earnings, as measured by the VAR, using a 95 percent confidence level and diversified correlation assuming one day to liquidate positions was $5.1 million and the average of such value during the year ended December 31, 2001 was estimated at $3.6 million. Risk Policy and Oversight ONEOK controls the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. The Companys Board of Directors affirms the risk limit parameters with its audit committee having oversight responsibilities for the policies. A risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price, credit and interest rate risk management, marketing and trading activities. The committee also proposes risk metrics including VAR and position loss limits. ONEOK has a corporate risk control organization lead by the Vice President of Risk Control, which is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies, procedures and limits and evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions. Key risk control activities include credit review and approval, credit and performance risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics. To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact the financial results and financial position of the Company either favorably or unfavorably. As a result, the Company cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position. 63

ONEOK relies on VAR to determine the potential reduction in the trading and price risk management portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period. 62 ONEOKs VAR exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized for its trading and price risk management portfolio of derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and gas in storage assuming hypothetical movements in commodity market assumptions with no change in positions and are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur. VAR does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur because actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices, operating exposures and timing thereof, and the changes in the Companys trading and price risk management portfolio of derivative financial instruments and physical contracts. At December 31, 2001, the Companys estimated potential one day favorable or unfavorable impact on future earnings, as measured by the VAR, using a 95 percent confidence level and diversified correlation assuming one day to liquidate positions was $5.1 million and the average of such value during the year ended December 31, 2001 was estimated at $3.6 million. Risk Policy and Oversight ONEOK controls the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. The Companys Board of Directors affirms the risk limit parameters with its audit committee having oversight responsibilities for the policies. A risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price, credit and interest rate risk management, marketing and trading activities. The committee also proposes risk metrics including VAR and position loss limits. ONEOK has a corporate risk control organization lead by the Vice President of Risk Control, which is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies, procedures and limits and evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions. Key risk control activities include credit review and approval, credit and performance risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics. To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact the financial results and financial position of the Company either favorably or unfavorably. As a result, the Company cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position. 63
