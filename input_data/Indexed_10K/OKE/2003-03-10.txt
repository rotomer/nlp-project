ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors Some of the statements contained and incorporated in this Form 10 K are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward looking statements relate to the anticipated financial performance, managements plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions and other matters. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements in various circumstances. The following discussion is intended to identify important factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, the information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and other statements contained or incorporated in this Form 10 K identified by words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, intend, believe, projection or goal. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements. Known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. Those factors may affect our operations, markets, products, services and prices. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with the forward looking statements, factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward looking statement include, among others, the following: risks associated with any reduction in our credit ratings; the effects of weather and other natural phenomena on sales and prices; competition from other energy suppliers as well as alternative forms of energy; the capital intensive nature of our business; further deregulation, or unbundling of the natural gas business; competitive changes in the natural gas gathering, transportation and storage business resulting from deregulation, or unbundling, of the natural gas business; the profitability of assets or businesses acquired by us; risks of marketing, trading, and hedging activities as a result of changes in energy prices or the financial condition of our trading partners; economic climate and growth in the geographic areas in which we do business; the uncertainty of gas and oil reserve estimates; the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for natural gas, natural gas liquids, electricity, and crude oil; 26 Table of Contents the effects of changes in governmental policies and regulatory actions, including, with respect to accounting policies, income taxes, environmental compliance, authorized rates, or recovery of gas costs; the impact of unforeseen changes in interest rates, equity markets, inflation rates, economic recession and other external factors over which we have no control, including the effect on pension expense and funding resulting from changes in stock market returns; risks associated with pending or possible acquisitions and dispositions, including our ability to finance or to integrate any such acquisitions and any regulatory delay or conditions imposed by regulatory bodies in connection with any such acquisitions; the results of administrative proceedings and litigation involving the OCC, KCC, Texas regulatory authorities or any other local, state or federal regulatory body; our ability to access capital and competitive rates on terms acceptable to us; actions taken by Westar or its affiliates with respect to its investment in ONEOK, including, without limitation, the effect of a sale of our shares of common stock and preferred stock beneficially owned by Westar; the risk of a significant slowdown in growth or decline in the U.S. economy, the risk of delay in growth or recovery in the U.S. economy or the risk of increased costs for insurance premiums, security or other items as a consequence of the September 11, 2001, or possible future terrorists attacks or war; and the other factors listed in the reports we have filed and may file from time to time with the SEC. Other factors and assumptions not identified above were also involved in the making of the forward looking statements. The failure of those assumptions to be realized, as well as other factors, may also cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Operating Environment and Outlook The energy industry has undergone tremendous changes throughout the past decade and energy trading in the past 12 to 18 months. Our strategy has been and continues to be one of growth through acquiring assets that complement and strengthen each other, maximizing the earnings potential of existing assets through asset rationalization and consolidation and introducing regulatory initiatives that benefit us and our customers. We believe that the energy markets will continue to see deregulation, although it may be different than how certain markets have been deregulated to date. We will continue to focus on enhancing the earnings potential of our existing assets through acquiring assets that grow our operations into new market areas and complement our existing asset base. Operating Highlights Acquisitions and Capital Expenditures On January 31, 2003, we closed the sale of some of the natural gas and oil producing properties of our production segment to Chesapeake Energy Corporation for a cash sales price of approximately $300 million. Pursuant to the sale, we sold natural gas and oil reserves in Oklahoma and Texas. The sale included approximately 1,900 wells, 482 of which were operated by us. We recorded a gain of approximately $74.4 million in the first quarter of 2003 related to this sale. On January 3, 2003, we closed the purchase of all of the Texas assets of Southern Union for a cash purchase price of approximately $420 million, subject to a working capital adjustment to be determined within 90 days of the closing of the transaction. The acquisition makes us the fifth largest gas distributor in the U.S., with almost two million customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. The assets acquired consist of the third largest gas distribution business in Texas, with operations that serve approximately 535,000 customers, over 90 percent of which are residential. On December 13, 2002, we closed the sale of some of our midstream natural gas assets for a sales price of approximately $92 million to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation, a private, independent oil and gas company. The assets that were sold are located in north central Oklahoma and include three processing plants and related gathering systems and our interest in a fourth processing plant. The sale of these assets is part of our strategy to dispose of assets that are not considered core assets for our future. In early 2001, we increased our common ownership interest in MHR from approximately nine percent to over 21 percent through conversion of shares and redemption of MHR preferred stock to shares of MHR common stock, as well as exercising warrants. As a result, we began accounting for the MHR investment using the equity method of accounting. In March 2002, MHR merged with Prize Energy Corp., which reduced our direct ownership to approximately 11 percent and reduced the number of MHR board of director positions held by us from two to one. At that time, we began accounting for our investment in MHR as an available for sale security and, accordingly, marked the investment to fair value through other 27 Table of Contents comprehensive income. In the second quarter of 2002, we sold our shares of MHR common stock for a pre tax gain of approximately $7.6 million, which is included in other income in 2002. We retained approximately 1.5 million stock purchase warrants. We also relinquished our remaining seat on MHRs board of directors. The MHR investment and related equity income and loss are reported in the Other segment. During 2001, we completed construction of the Spring Creek Power Plant, located in Logan County, Oklahoma, and began operations in mid 2001. Four gas powered turbines provide electricity during peak demand periods. We spent approximately $42.3 million in 2001 and $58.7 million in 2000 constructing the 300 megawatt plant. In 2000, we made two significant asset acquisitions that greatly enhanced our Gathering and Processing, Transportation and Storage, and Marketing and Trading segments. The combined acquisitions included natural gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 1.6 Bcf/d, approximately 14,000 miles of gathering and transmission lines, and natural gas storage facilities with a combined capacity of approximately 10 Bcf and contributed to a significant increase in trading. The acquisition of these assets demonstrates execution of our strategy of growing through acquisition of assets that complement and strengthen each other. Regulatory In 2000, KGS was successful in obtaining temporary approval of weather normalization. KGS also obtained permanent approval of the WeatherProof Bill Program that had been a temporary program. As this is a permanent program, it will remain in effect until KGS requests the program cease. We believe that the successful implementation of these initiatives and programs will reduce the impact of weather on earnings and customer bills. In January 2003, KGS filed a rate case with the KCC to increase rates approximately $76 million. The KCC has 240 days to issue a final order on the rate case. If approved, the new rates will be effective for the 2003/2004 heating season. Until a final order is received, KGS will operate under the current rate schedules. The weather normalization rider was included in the rate case filing with the KCC in January 2003. In 2001, the OCC issued an order denying ONG the right to collect $34.6 million in unrecovered gas costs incurred while serving customers during the 2000/2001 winter season. We appealed this Order to the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked the OCC to stay the provisions of this Order, pending the outcome of our appeal. The OCC subsequently approved our request to stay this Order, which allowed ONG to collect the $34.6 million, subject to a refund had we ultimately lost the case. A Joint Stipulation approved by the OCC on May 16, 2002, settled a number of outstanding cases pending before the OCC, including the Commissions inquiry into our gas cost procurement practices during the winter of 2000/2001. It also settled cases relating to an application seeking relief from improper and excessive purchased gas costs and an enforcement action against us, our subsidiaries and affiliated companies of ONG. In addition, all of the open inquiries related to the annual audits of ONGs fuel adjustment clause for 1996 to 2000 were closed as a result of this Stipulation. The Joint Stipulation has a $33.7 million value to ONG customers that will be realized over a three year period. In July 2002, immediate cash savings were provided to all ONG customers in the form of billing credits totaling approximately $9.1 million, with an additional $1.0 million available for former customers returning to our system. If the additional $1.0 million is not fully refunded to customers returning to the ONG system by December 2005, the remainder will be included in the final billing credit. ONG has replaced certain gas contracts, which is expected to reduce gas costs by approximately $13.8 million due to avoided reservation fees between April 2003 and October 2005. Additional savings of approximately $8.0 million from the use of storage service in lieu of those contracts are expected to occur between November 2003 and March 2005. Any expected savings from the use of storage that are not achieved, any remaining billing credits not issued to returning customers and an additional $1.8 million credit will be added to the final billing credit scheduled to be provided to customers in December 2005. ONG operating income increased by $14.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, compared to 2001 as a result of this settlement and the revision of the estimated loss recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Other On January 1, 2003, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (Statement 123) and will expense the fair value of all stock options beginning with options granted on or after January 1, 2003. See Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of our pro forma net income and earnings per share information had we applied the provisions of Statement 123 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and included in this 28 Table of Contents report on Form 10 K. Certain amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosure must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. Therefore, the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. We believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others, as discussed below. Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities We engage in price risk management activities for both energy trading and non trading purposes. Through 2002, we accounted for price risk management activities for our energy trading contracts in accordance with EITF 98 10. EITF 98 10 requires entities involved in energy trading activities to account for energy trading contracts using mark to market accounting. Forwards, swaps, options, and energy transportation and storage contracts utilized for trading activities are reflected at fair value as assets and liabilities from price risk management activities in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of these assets and liabilities is affected by the actual timing of settlements related to these contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of price movements. Changes in fair value are recognized in net revenues, on a net basis, in the consolidated statements of income. Market prices used to determine fair value of these assets and liabilities reflect managements best estimate considering various factors, including closing exchange and over the counter quotations, time value and volatility underlying the commitments. Market prices are adjusted for the potential impact of liquidating our position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions. During the third quarter of 2002, we adopted the applicable provisions of EITF 02 3. EITF 02 3 provides that all mark to market gains and losses on energy trading contracts should be presented on a net basis (energy contract sales less energy contract costs) in the income statement without regard to the settlement provisions of the contract. Prior to the third quarter of 2002, energy trading revenues and costs were presented on a gross basis. The historical financial results of all energy trading contracts have been restated to reflect the adoption of EITF 02 3. Energy trading revenues include natural gas, reservation fees, crude oil, natural gas liquids, and basis. Basis is the natural gas price differential that exists between two trading locations relative to the Henry Hub price. In October 2002, the EITF of the FASB rescinded EITF 98 10. As a result, energy related contracts that are not accounted for pursuant to Statement 133, will no longer be carried at fair value, but rather will be accounted for as executory contracts and accounted for on an accrual basis. As a result of the rescission of this statement, the EITF also agreed that energy trading inventories carried under storage agreements should no longer be carried at fair value but should be carried at the lower of cost or market. The rescission is effective for all fiscal periods beginning after December 31, 2002 and for all existing energy trading contracts and inventory as of October 25, 2002. Additionally, the rescission applies immediately to contracts entered into on or after October 25, 2002. Changes to the accounting for existing contracts as a result of the rescission of EITF 98 10 will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. At this time, we estimate this will result in a cumulative effect loss, net of tax, of approximately $141.0 million. Any impact from this change will be non cash. All recoveries of the estimated value associated with this change in accounting will be recognized in operating income in future periods. The impact of adopting the rescission of EITF 98 10 will be included in the March 31, 2003 financial statements. Regulation Our intrastate transmission pipelines and distribution operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the OCC, KCC and TRC. Certain of our other transportation activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. Allocation of costs and revenues to accounting periods for ratemaking and regulatory purposes may differ from bases generally applied by non regulated operations. Such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered to be generally accepted accounting principles for regulated utilities, provided that there is a demonstrable ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates. During the rate making process, regulatory commissions may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred. This allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery. This causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates. Continued recovery of all regulatory assets is expected. Should recovery cease due to regulatory actions, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. 29 Table of Contents Impairments We assess for impairment of long lived assets when indicators of impairment are present. An impairment is recognized if the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount. Impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. Fair values are based on discounted future cash flows or information provided by sales and purchases of similar assets. See further discussion of our significant accounting policies in Note A of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Consolidated Operations The following table sets forth certain selected financial information for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Financial Results (Thousands of Dollars) Operating revenues, excluding energy trading revenues $ 1,894,851 $ 1,814,180 $ 1,932,591 Energy trading revenues, net 209,429 101,761 63,588 Cost of gas 1,128,620 1,089,566 1,250,527 Net revenues 975,660 826,375 745,652 Operating costs 456,339 437,233 301,723 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 147,843 133,533 119,425 Operating income $ 371,478 $ 255,609 $ 324,504 Other income $ 12,426 $ 9,852 $ 40,419 Other expense $ 19,038 $ 8,976 $ 21,944 Discontinued operations, net of taxes (Note C) Income from discontinued component $ 10,648 $ 24,879 $ 5,826 Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ $ (2,151 ) $ 2,115 Operating Results Increased energy trading revenues, net in 2002 compared to 2001 were achieved by diversifying our portfolio to include crude oil and natural gas liquids. The increased use of storage and transport capacity also contributed to our ability to capture price volatility in energy trading. Mark to market earnings were $42.6 million in 2002 compared to $35.3 million in 2001 and contributed to the increase in energy trading revenues, net. Net revenues in 2002 include the $14.0 million recovery of a portion of the costs related to Enron sales contracts that were written off in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the $14.2 million adjustment due to the OCC settlement. Write off of these costs totaled $72.0 million in 2001. We also benefited in the Marketing and Trading segment from the renegotiation of certain long term transportation contracts in 2002. Operating costs increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to higher employee costs. Other income in 2002 includes a $7.6 million gain related to the sale of our investment in MHR, a $1.5 million gain related to the sale of certain Oklahoma property rights in the Transportation and Storage segment, and a $1.9 million gain related to the sale of certain Texas transmission assets in the Transportation and Storage segment. Other expense in 2002 includes $2.1 million of ongoing litigation costs associated with our terminated acquisition of Southwest and $8.0 million for the settlement of litigation with Southwest and Southern Union. Interest expense decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the interest rate swaps we have in place that reduced interest expense by $20.6 million in 2002, compared to a $5.3 million reduction in 2001, from what the expense would have been with fixed rates. Interest expense also decreased due to the reduced balance in commercial paper and lower interest rates relating to commercial paper. See Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of interest rate swaps. A full year of operations of the assets acquired in March and April of 2000 contributed to increased net revenues in 2001 compared to 2000, despite lower energy prices in the latter part of 2001, and increased operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Our ability to successfully execute our transportation and storage arbitrage strategy also continued to favorably impact operating results. The impact of the OCC ruling related to the recovery of gas costs from the 2000/2001 winter reduced operating income by $34.6 million and the impact of the Enron bankruptcy reduced operating 30 Table of Contents income by $37.4 million in 2001. Included in Other income for 2001 is $8.1 million in income from equity investments including MHR. Other expense in 2001 includes $3.7 million of ongoing litigation costs associated with the terminated acquisition of Southwest and a $1.5 million insurance deductible payment related to the Yaggy storage facility. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2001 is the result of changes in estimates of prior year tax liabilities recorded in the third quarter. Interest expense increased in 2001 compared to 2000 as a result of increased debt, primarily due to financing of acquisitions and increased working capital including unrecovered purchased gas costs. We had interest rate swaps in place that reduced interest expense by $5.3 million in 2001 from what the expense would have been with fixed interest rates. See Note K to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of interest rate swaps. Marketing and Trading Operational Highlights Our Companys marketing and trading operation purchases, stores, markets, and trades natural gas to both the wholesale and retail sectors throughout most of the United States. We have strong mid continent region storage positions and transport capacity of 1 Bcf/d that allow us to trade natural gas from border to border and coast to coast. With total storage capacity of 80 Bcf, withdrawal capability of 2.4 Bcf/d and injection capability of 1.3 Bcf/d, we have direct access to most regions of the country and flexibility to capture volatility in the energy markets. We continue to enhance our strategy of focusing on higher margin business which includes providing reliable service during peak demand periods through the use of storage and transportation capacity. We constructed a peak electric power generating plant in mid 2001. The 300 megawatt plant is located in Oklahoma adjacent to one of our natural gas storage facilities and is configured to supply electric power during peak demand periods. This plant allows us to capture the spark spread premium, which is the value added by converting natural gas to electricity, during peak demand periods. During the first quarter of 2002, our Power segment was combined with our Marketing and Trading segment, eliminating the Power segment. This reflects our strategy of trading around the capacity of our electric generating plant. All segment data has been restated to reflect this change. During the third quarter of 2002, we adopted certain provisions of EITF 02 3, which provides that all mark to market gains and losses on energy trading contracts should be presented on a net basis (energy contract sales less energy contract costs) in the income statement without regard to the settlement provisions of the contract. Prior to the third quarter of 2002, our energy trading revenues and costs were presented on a gross basis. The financial results of all energy trading contracts have been restated to reflect the adoption of EITF 02 3 for all periods presented. EITF 02 3 does not affect power related revenues, which will continue to be reported on a gross basis. In October 2002, the EITF rescinded EITF 98 10. As a result, energy related contracts that are not accounted for pursuant to Statement 133, will no longer be carried at fair value, but rather will be accounted for as executory contracts and accounted for on an accrual basis. As a result of the rescission of this statement, the Task Force also agreed that energy trading inventories carried under storage agreements should no longer be carried at fair value, but should be carried at the lower of cost or market. The rescission is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 31, 2002 and for all existing energy trading contracts and inventory as of October 25, 2002. Additionally, the rescission applies immediately to contracts entered into on or after October 25, 2002. Changes to the accounting for existing contracts as a result of the rescission of EITF 98 10 will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. At this time, we estimate this will result in a cumulative effect loss, net of tax, of approximately $141.0 million. Any impact from this change will be non cash. All recoveries of the estimated value associated with this change in accounting will be recognized in operating income in future periods. The impact of adopting the rescission of EITF 98 10 will be included in our March 31, 2003 financial statements. The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Marketing and Trading segment for the periods indicated. 31 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Financial Results (Thousands of Dollars) Energy trading revenues, net $ 209,429 $ 101,761 $ 63,588 Power sales 71,749 28,101 Cost of power and fuel 67,646 21,234 Other revenues 948 1,659 2,894 Net revenues 214,480 110,287 66,482 Operating costs 27,674 32,846 14,321 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 5,298 2,611 887 Operating income $ 181,508 $ 74,830 $ 51,274 Other income, net $ (4,871 ) $ 253 $ Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ $ $ 2,115 Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Operating Information Natural gas volumes (MMcf) 998,537 977,602 990,033 Natural gas gross margin ($/Mcf) $ 0.13 $ 0.10 $ 0.06 Power volumes (MMwh) 2,228 467 Power gross margin ($/Mwh) $ 1.73 $ 14.69 $ Physically settled volumes (MMcf)(a) 1,990,371 1,989,186 1,915,511 Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 2,340 $ 43,486 $ 59,512 (a) This represents the absolute value of gross transaction volumes for both buy and sell energy trading contracts that were physically settled. Operating Results Energy trading revenues include revenues related to trading natural gas, reservation fees, crude oil, natural gas liquids, and basis. Basis is the natural gas price differential that exists between trading locations relative to the Henry Hub natural gas price. We began actively trading crude oil and natural gas liquids in this segment in the first quarter of 2002. Net revenues significantly increased in 2002 over 2001 while sales volumes increased only slightly. The increase in net revenues is attributable to our use of storage and transport capacity to capture the significant intra month and regional price volatility from border to border and coast to coast. Our storage and transport capacity also enabled us to secure positive option value and favorable winter/summer spreads on stored gas volumes. In 2002, we also diversified our marketing and trading portfolio to include crude oil and natural gas liquids, which positively impacted our net revenues. We also benefited from the renegotiation of certain long term transportation contracts. Power related margins decreased in 2002 compared to 2001, despite higher sales volume, due to comparatively smaller spark spreads and reduced volatility in the Southwest Power Pool. In the first quarter of 2002, we sold our Enron bankruptcy claim, which added $10.4 million to our net revenues. Our net revenues for the years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000 include income recognized from mark to market accounting of approximately $42.6 million, $35.3 million and $24.3 million, respectively. As a percentage of energy trading revenues, net, mark to market earnings have declined each year, indicative of our strategy of focusing on our physical leased transportation and storage assets and enabling us to capture the embedded optionality we possess with the price volatility due to the physical changes in supply and demand. Operating costs were lower in 2002 compared to 2001 as the prior year included a reserve for Enron related bad debts of $14.5 million. Excluding the Enron related reserve, operating costs were higher in 2002 due to increased employee costs and the addition of trading, risk management, and support personnel. 32 Table of Contents Other income, net decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to an increase in fees paid to affiliated parties for use of corporate capital related to performance guarantees issued to OEMT. Our natural gas sales volumes averaged 2.8 Bcf/d in 2002 and 2.7 Bcf/d in 2001 and 2000, while our margin per Mcf increased in 2002 over the prior year due to the price volatility in the market. Capital expenditures in 2001 and 2000 consist primarily of costs related to the construction of the electric generating plant, which was completed in mid 2001. The increase in our net revenues in 2001 compared to 2000 is attributable to our ability to capture higher margins by arbitraging regional price volatility through the use of our storage and transportation capacity. We were also able to capture wider winter/summer spreads on stored volumes and benefited from falling prices that positively impacted fuel costs associated with our long term transportation contracts, while sales volumes decreased slightly. Increased operating costs were due primarily to increased personnel costs required to operate the expanded base of marketing and trading activities acquired in 2000. Also, the Enron bankruptcy resulted in a $22.9 million increase in cost of gas and a $14.5 million increase in operating costs, totaling a $37.4 million negative impact on operating results for 2001. Gross margin per Mcf improved in 2001 compared to 2000, as we had fully integrated our mid continent marketing and trading base following the acquisition in 2000 and were successfully executing our strategies for transportation and use of storage that focus on capturing higher margin sales. Gathering and Processing Operational Highlights The Gathering and Processing segment is engaged in the gathering and processing of natural gas and the fractionation, storage and marketing of NGLs. Our Gathering and Processing segment currently has a processing capacity of approximately 1.993 Bcf/d, of which approximately 0.107 Bcf/d is currently idle. The capacity associated with plants owned or leased is approximately 1.776 Bcf/d, while the amount of the plant capacity that we own an interest in but do not operate is approximately 0.110 Bcf/d. Our Gathering and Processing segment owns approximately 13,962 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plants. In December 2002, we completed the sale of three processing plants and related gathering assets, along with interest in a fourth processing plant, all located in Oklahoma, to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation. The sale reduced our processing capacity by 0.136 Bcf/d. The capacity associated with plants owned or leased was reduced by 0.122 Bcf/d, while the amount of the plant capacity that we own an interest in but do not operate was reduced by 0.014 Bcf/d. The sale also reduced our gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plant by approximately 2,800 miles. The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Gathering and Processing segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Financial Results (Thousands of Dollars) Natural gas liquids and condensate sales $ 654,930 $ 587,842 $ 536,470 Gas sales 380,095 635,569 426,364 Gathering, compression, dehydration and processing fees and other revenues 98,196 91,406 73,879 Cost of sales 938,843 1,125,196 812,701 Net revenues 194,378 189,621 224,012 Operating costs 127,747 116,853 90,501 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 33,523 29,201 22,692 Operating income $ 33,108 $ 43,567 $ 110,819 Other income, net $ (1,119 ) $ (178 ) $ 26,460 33 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Gas Processing Plants Operating Information Total gas gathered (MMMBtu/d) 1,205 1,331 1,171 Total gas processed (MMMBtu/d) 1,411 1,420 1,206 Natural gas liquids sales (MBbls/d) 95 76 66 Natural gas liquids produced (MBbls/d) 73 74 69 Gas sales (MMMBtu/d) 343 391 315 Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 43,101 $ 51,442 $ 32,383 Operating Results The increase in NGL and condensate sales revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily due to the additional sales volumes generated from the NGL pipeline facilities leased at the end of 2001. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in composite NGL prices and crude oil prices. The Conway OPIS composite NGL price based on our NGL product mix for 2002 decreased from $0.48 per gallon in 2001 to $0.40 per gallon in 2002. The average NYMEX crude oil price decreased from $26.60 per barrel in 2001 to $25.41 per barrel in 2002. Gas sales and cost of sales decreased in 2002 compared to 2001, due to lower volumes sold and decreases in natural gas prices. Average natural gas price for the mid continent region decreased from $4.16 per MMBtu for 2001 to $3.00 per MMBtu in 2002. Lower sales volumes in 2002 compared to 2001 were primarily the result of the change in plant operations to decrease the NGL recovery in the first quarter of 2001 due to the high value of natural gas relative to NGL prices, which increased natural gas sales in 2001. The increase in net revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily due to contractual changes, customer elections regarding processing, and the relative value of NGLs compared to natural gas. These increases were partially offset by the effects of an ice storm in the first quarter of 2002 that caused plant outages across much of Oklahoma, and the sale of certain gathering and processing assets in December 2002. The increase in operating costs in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily due to additional costs associated with the NGL pipeline facilities leased at the end of 2001. Operating costs also increased for customer charge offs, increased bad debt reserves and higher employee costs. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily due to the $2.4 million loss taken in the third quarter associated with the gas processing plants that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2002. An additional loss of $1.3 million on the assets sold was taken in the fourth quarter and is included in other income, net. Depreciation expense also increased as a result of increased property, plant and equipment. A full year of operation of assets acquired in early 2000 contributed to increased revenues and cost of sales for 2001 compared to 2000. However, decreased processing spreads and lower natural gas prices resulted in lower net revenues for 2001. In the first quarter of 2001, there were negative processing spreads for the first time in more than 10 years and intermonth volatility during the year was the greatest it had been at any time during that same 10 year period. The overall processing spread for 2001 was approximately 75 percent of the previous 10 year average of $1.29 per MMBtu. During the year, crude oil and natural gas prices ranged from $32.19 per barrel and $9.98 per MMBtu to $17.72 per barrel and $1.83 per MMBtu, respectively. The downturn of the economy reduced the demand for many NGL products, particularly ethane, which is a major component of plastic products. Additionally, record high inventories in natural gas and other petroleum products, such as propane, along with significantly warmer than normal temperatures across North America during the heating season lowered demand for natural gas, home heating oil and propane, causing weaker than expected prices in 2001. Increased operating costs and depreciation, depletion, and amortization in 2001 were the result of a full year of operation for the assets acquired in 2000. Volumes of natural gas gathered and processed, NGL sales, NGLs produced and gas sales increased for 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to a full year of operation of the assets acquired in 2000, which provided increased processing and fractionation capacity. Average NGL prices for 2001 decreased compared to 2000, which offset the impact of the increased volumes. The Conway OPIS composite NGL price based on our NGL product mix for 2001 decreased 11 percent from $0.53 per gallon to $0.47 per gallon. Average natural gas prices increased for the same period despite decreases during the last half of 2001. The gas price for the mid continent region increased 11 percent in 2001 from an average of $3.74 MMBtu to an average of $4.16 MMBtu. 34 Table of Contents Risk Management At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Gathering and Processing segment had a portion of its natural gas costs and NGL production hedged. We also used derivative instruments during 2002 and 2001 to minimize risk associated with price volatility. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Transportation and Storage Operating Highlights Our Transportation and Storage segment represents our intrastate natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas storage and nonprocessable gas gathering facilities. We own or lease five storage facilities in Oklahoma, three in Kansas and three in Texas, with a combined working capacity of approximately 59.6 Bcf, of which 9.5 Bcf is temporarily idle. Our intrastate transmission pipelines operate in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and are regulated by the OCC, KCC, and TRC, respectively. In July 2002, we completed a transaction to transfer certain transmission assets in Kansas to our affiliated distribution company in Kansas. All historical financial and statistical information has been adjusted to reflect this transfer. In December 2002, certain Oklahoma storage property rights were sold and a long term agreement was entered into with the purchaser, whereby we retain storage capacity consistent with our historical usage. The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Transportation and Storage segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Financial Results (Thousands of Dollars) Transportation and gathering revenues $ 89,349 $ 102,092 $ 77,720 Storage revenues 37,101 37,645 38,464 Gas sales and other revenues 37,784 23,326 35,882 Cost of fuel and gas 46,650 49,626 42,876 Net revenues 117,584 113,437 109,190 Operating costs 46,694 42,357 34,645 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 17,563 17,990 17,439 Operating income $ 53,327 $ 53,090 $ 57,106 Other income, net $ 4,649 $ 2,578 $ 3,240 Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Operating Information Volumes transported (MMcf) 507,972 486,866 486,542 Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 20,554 $ 32,378 $ 32,688 Operating results Transportation and gathering revenues decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to a decrease in the price of natural gas and its impact on the valuation of retained fuel. This was partially offset by an increase in the volumes transported. The average price of natural gas for the mid continent region decreased 28 percent to $3.00 per MMBtu in 2002 compared to $4.16 per MMBtu in 2001. Gas sales and other revenues increased in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to increased gas inventory sales, partially offset by lower gas sales volumes associated with wellhead purchases on certain gathering facilities in Oklahoma. Cost of fuel and gas decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to decreased natural gas prices for fuel and decreases in gas sales volumes and fuel volumes primarily associated with our wellhead purchases. These decreases were partially offset by adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of third party contractual storage and pipeline imbalance positions and costs related to gas inventory sales. Increased gas inventory sales were the primary reason net revenues increased in 2002 compared to 2001. This increase was partially offset by costs resulting from the reconciliation of third party contractual storage and pipeline imbalance positions. 35 Table of Contents The increase in operating costs in 2002 compared to 2001 is due primarily to the settlement of certain legal proceedings, increased bad debt expense, and increased employee costs. Other income, net increased in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to a gain on the sale of certain storage assets in Oklahoma and transmission assets in Texas. Transportation revenues increased for 2001 compared to 2000 due to higher retained fuel from a full year of operation of assets acquired in early 2000. The expiration of gas sales contracts acquired in early 2000 resulted in a decrease of $4.6 million in gas sales revenue in 2001. While revenues from unaffiliated companies decreased as gas sales contracts expired, revenues from transportation contracts replaced the margin generated by those expired gas sales contracts. The increase in cost of fuel in 2001 compared to 2000 is due to a full year of operation of the assets acquired in 2000 and increased gas prices. Operating costs increased due to higher ad valorem taxes, labor and other operating costs associated with a full year of operation of the assets acquired in 2000. Depreciation, depletion and amortization also increased in 2001 due to the 2000 acquisitions. Regulatory Initiatives In a May 2000 OCC Order, our transportation assets in Oklahoma included in the Transportation and Storage segment became a separate regulated utility from the Distribution segment. We have flexibility in establishing transportation rates with customers; however, there is a maximum rate that we can charge our customers. We are competing for gathering and storage business at market based rates. Distribution Operational Highlights The Distribution segment provides natural gas distribution services in Oklahoma and Kansas. Our operations in Oklahoma are conducted through ONG, which serves residential, commercial, and industrial customers and leases pipeline capacity. Our operations in Kansas are conducted through KGS, which serves residential, commercial, and industrial customers. The Distribution segment serves about 80 percent of the population of Oklahoma and about 75 percent of the population of Kansas. ONG and KGS are subject to regulatory oversight by the OCC and KCC, respectively. The following table set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Distribution segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Financial Results (Thousands of Dollars) Gas sales $ 1,140,257 $ 1,434,184 $ 1,198,604 Cost of gas 806,251 1,141,668 888,464 Gross margin 334,006 292,516 310,140 PCL and ECT revenues 59,877 55,206 59,205 Other revenues 20,510 21,578 16,128 Net revenues 414,393 369,300 385,473 Operating costs 243,170 237,657 210,252 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 76,063 70,359 68,917 Operating income $ 95,160 $ 61,284 $ 106,304 Other income, net $ (3,183 ) $ (3,566 ) $ (3,321 ) Operating Results The decrease in gas sales and cost of gas in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to lower natural gas prices in 2002, as well as the recognition of unusually high natural gas prices in 2001 from the 2000/2001 winter. The OCC Joint Stipulation resulted in $14.2 million being recorded as a reduction in the cost of gas in 2002. Gas sales and cost of gas increased in 2001 compared to 2000 due to a higher weighted average cost of gas. Although prices of natural gas decreased in the latter part of 2001 from their historically high levels during the winter of 2000/2001, the higher priced gas incurred during late 2000 and early 2001 were not immediately recovered from customers. Action taken by the OCC, combined with the functioning of our purchased gas cost recovery mechanisms, delayed the recovery and recognition of a portion of these high gas costs. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a $34.6 million charge to cost of gas as a result of the OCCs order limiting ONGs recovery of gas purchase expense related to the 2000/2001 winter. This resulted in a decrease in gross margin on gas sales in 36 Table of Contents 2001 compared to 2000. KGS gross margin increased $3.0 million in 2001 over 2000 due to impact of the Weather Normalization Program offsetting the warmer weather. ECT revenues decreased $3.4 million in 2001 from 2000 due largely to lower volumes delivered to electric generation customers due to milder summer weather. Operating costs increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to increased employee costs. Operating costs for 2001 increased over 2000 due to additional bad debt expense of $19.2 million incurred as a result of the increased natural gas prices during the winter of 2000/2001. This was partially offset by a reduction in operating costs due to the continuation of a successful cost containment program. The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Distribution segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Gross Margin per Mcf Oklahoma Residential $ 2.48 $ 2.47 $ 2.76 Commercial $ 2.20 $ 1.95 $ 1.97 Industrial $ 1.39 $ 1.20 $ 1.09 Pipeline capacity leases $ 0.29 $ 0.30 $ 0.27 Kansas Residential $ 2.54 $ 2.62 $ 2.53 Commercial $ 1.94 $ 1.99 $ 2.00 Industrial $ 1.42 $ 1.46 $ 1.62 Wholesale $ 0.10 $ 0.09 $ 0.14 End use customer transportation $ 0.49 $ 0.61 $ 0.63 Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Volumes (MMcf) Gas sales Residential 104,559 102,976 107,154 Commercial 36,456 40,578 40,713 Industrial 3,243 4,101 5,582 Wholesale 32,082 31,060 34,781 Total volumes sold 176,340 178,715 188,230 PCL and ECT 163,657 136,975 158,100 Total volumes delivered 339,997 315,690 346,330 Gross margin per Mcf for Oklahoma residential customers remained essentially the same for 2002 compared to 2001 due to volumes sold remaining flat for the two periods. The number of residential customers increased slightly due to fewer customers being disconnected. Gross margin per Mcf increased for Oklahoma commercial and industrial customers in 2002 compared to 2001 due to lower volumes being sold. When volumes are lower, the tiered rate structure results in a greater percent of gas to be delivered at a higher delivery fee. The fixed customer fee per customer also results in a higher margin when sales are lower. The lower volumes are a result of economic factors causing commercial and industrial customers to reduce their overall consumption. Gross margin per Mcf for Oklahoma PCL customers decreased for 2002 compared to 2001 due to the increase in volumes transported by high volume users and the rate per Mcf being less for high volume users. PCL volumes returned to a more normal level in 2002 after industrial customers curtailed production in 2001 due to high gas costs. Volume increases in 2002 were also due to customers moving from commercial and industrial rates to the new transport rates, and a marketing effort to add small usage PCL customers. 37 Table of Contents The decrease in Kansas residential and commercial gross margins per Mcf for 2002 from 2001 results from a decrease in weather normalization revenues. The Weather Normalization Program provides for additional revenues when heating degree days are less than normal and reduces revenue when heating degree days are greater than normal. The changes in revenue from the program do not impact the volumes sold and result in a per unit deviation. Kansas industrial customers are billed on rates that decrease with increased volumes, or step rates, during the months of April through October. During these months, industrial customers are billed at base rates for the first block of volumes and they are billed at approximately half the base rate for a second block of volumes. A greater number of volumes were sold at the lower rate second block for 2002 compared to 2001, resulting in a lower unit margin for 2002. End use customer transportation (ECT) margins per Mcf decreased for 2002 compared to 2001 due to greater volumes sold to lower margin interruptible transport service customers. The increase in ECT volumes in 2002 from 2001 is largely due to the assumption of large volume customers by Kansas with the transfer of the MCMC transmission pipeline assets. Additionally, warmer and dryer weather increased volumes to irrigation and gas fired electric generation customers. The decrease in residential volumes sold in 2001 was due to warmer weather in 2001 compared to 2000. Industrial sales for Oklahoma and wholesale sales for Kansas decreased during the same period due to the movement of some customers to the PCL program in Oklahoma and the ECT program in Kansas. Oklahomas gross margin per Mcf for industrial customers increased in 2001 compared to 2000 due to decreased volumes resulting in a greater percent of gas delivered at a higher cost under the tiered rate schedule. A full year of tariff rate reductions in 2001 resulted in a decrease to gross margin per Mcf for residential and commercial. The decrease in PCL and ECT volumes in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the fact that some customers that use significant quantities of gas in their manufacturing process suspended manufacturing operations in late 2000 and early 2001 due to unusually high natural gas prices. These decreases were partially offset by reducing our minimum capacity requirements for customers to become eligible for PCL and ECT services pursuant to a regulatory order. The reduction of the minimum requirements allowed more low volume customers to be added to the customer base. The following table sets forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Distribution segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Operating Information Average number of customers 1,439,657 1,436,444 1,418,444 Customers per employee 623 611 572 Capital expenditures (Thousands) $ 115,569 $ 133,470 $ 129,996 Our capital expenditure program includes expenditures for extending service to new areas, modifying customer service lines, increasing system capabilities, and general replacements and betterments. It is our practice to maintain and periodically upgrade facilities to assure safe, reliable, and efficient operations. The capital expenditure program included $18.3 million, $22.4 million, and $21.4 million for new business development in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Regulatory Initiatives KGS filed a rate case on January 31, 2003 to increase rates by $76 million. The KCC has up to 240 days to review the application and issue a final order. If approved, the new rates would become effective for the 2003/2004 winter heating season. Until regulatory approval is received, KGS will operate under the current rate schedules. In January 2003, we closed on the purchase of all the Texas assets of Southern Union for $420 million, subject to adjustment. The gas distribution operations serve approximately 535,000 customers in cities located throughout the state of Texas, including the major cities of El Paso and Austin, as well as the cities of Port Arthur, Galveston, Brownsville, and others. Over 90 percent of the customers are residential. The acquisition will be reflected in our March 31, 2003 financial statements. Operating income for the Texas properties for the twelve months ending June 30, 2002, was $41.2 million, of which approximately 95 percent was related to the Texas distribution operations. In July 2002, we completed a transaction to transfer certain transmission assets in Kansas from our Transportation and Storage segment to KGS. All historical financial and statistical information has been adjusted to reflect this transfer. 38 Table of Contents ONG continues to take an active role in response to the OCCs Notice of Inquiry regarding the use of physical and financial instruments to hedge against fuel procurement volatility. ONG exercised provisions contained in a number of its gas supply contracts that allow us to fix the price of a portion of its gas supply. ONG fixed the price of approximately 37% of its anticipated 2002/2003 winter gas supply deliveries. ONG received approval from the OCC to create a Voluntary Fixed Price pilot program that will enable its general sales customers to fix the gas cost portion of their bill for a specified winter period. The program was initiated to provide customers with a means of controlling their 2002/2003 gas bills. Over 20,000 customers signed up for this program for the first heating season. A Joint Stipulation approved by the OCC on May 16, 2002, settled a number of outstanding cases pending before the OCC. The major cases settled were the Commissions inquiry into our gas cost procurement practices during the winter of 2000/2001; an application seeking relief from improper and excessive purchased gas costs; and an enforcement action against us, our subsidiaries and affiliated companies of ONG. In addition, all of the open inquiries related to the annual audits of ONGs fuel adjustment clause for 1996 to 2000 were closed as a result of this Stipulation. The Joint Stipulation has a $33.7 million value to ONG customers that will be realized over a three year period. In July 2002, immediate cash savings were provided to all ONG customers in the form of billing credits totaling approximately $9.1 million, with an additional $1.0 million available for former customers returning to our system. If the additional $1.0 million is not fully refunded to customers returning to the ONG system by December 2005, the remainder will be included in the final billing credit. ONG is replacing certain gas contracts, which is expected to reduce gas costs by approximately $13.8 million due to avoided reservation fees between April 2003 and October 2005. Additional savings of approximately $8.0 million from the use of storage service in lieu of those contracts are expected to occur between November 2003 and March 2005. Any expected savings from the use of storage that are not achieved, any remaining billing credits not issued to returning customers and an additional $1.8 million credit will be added to the final billing credit scheduled to be provided to customers in December 2005. ONG operating income increased by $14.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001 as a result of this settlement and the revision of the estimated loss recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. During 2001, the KCC issued an Order extending the time period for which gas service disconnection during inclement weather conditions cannot be made. Due to the extension of the time period restricting disconnections, delinquent KGS customers were allowed to continue gas service, thus increasing uncollectible amounts. Higher gas costs in the 2000/2001 heating season also contributed to the increased uncollectible amounts. KGS and other distribution companies in Kansas filed a joint application with the KCC seeking approval to recover the additional uncollectible amounts incurred during the 2000/2001 heating season until reviewed in the next rate case. The KCC approved the deferral allowing the companies to seek recovery of the extraordinary uncollectible account levels experienced in the 2000/2001 winter. During 2000, the KCC issued an Order allowing KGS to recover additional costs of its gas purchase hedging program established to protect the price paid by customers for gas purchases. The KCC approved KGSs WeatherProof Bill Program that had been a temporary program. This plan allows customers, at their discretion, to fix their monthly payment. The KCC also granted KGS weather normalization in December 2000 that minimizes weather related revenue fluctuations. Certain costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process have been recorded as regulatory assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Although no further unbundling of services is anticipated, should this occur, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria of a regulatory asset and, accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. We do not anticipate that such a write off of costs, if any, will be material. Production Operational Highlights Our strategy is to concentrate ownership of natural gas and oil reserves in the mid continent region in order to add value not only to our existing production operations but also to the related gathering, processing, marketing, transportation, and storage businesses. Accordingly, we focus on exploitation activities rather than exploratory drilling. As a result of our growth strategy through acquisitions and developmental drilling, the number of wells we operate increased in 2002 prior to the agreement to sell, discussed below, and are expected to increase again as we re establish reserves. In our role as operator, we control operating decisions that impact production volumes and lifting costs. We continually focus on reducing finding costs and minimizing production costs. 39 Table of Contents We continually evaluate opportunities to sell properties at premium values when the market allows. In November 2002, we entered into an agreement to sell 1,913 of our wells for approximately $300 million. The assets sold and the results of their operations are reflected as a discontinued operation in the December 31, 2002 financial statements. All financial and statistical information for all periods presented has been restated to reflect the discontinued operation. After the sale, we will continue to own interests in 574 wells, and expect to continue to pursue our oil and gas strategy for growth. During 2002, we acquired approximately $3.7 million in gas and oil properties. Through our developmental drilling program, we drilled 117 wells in 2002, of which 38 of the completed wells were retained, compared to 155 wells completed in 2001, of which 44 were retained. The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Production segment for the periods indicated.

All proved undeveloped reserves are attributed to locations directly offsetting (adjacent to) productive units. Operating Results Net revenues from continuing operations decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to lower realized gas prices. Hedging gains of $1.2 million are included in 2002 continuing operations, which partially offset the decline in gas prices. The net revenues for 2001 included hedging losses of $3.6 million. The 2002 revenues from continuing operations also include a recovery of $0.8 million related to the sale of our Enron claim on hedging contracts and income from the discontinued component includes $1.9 million related to the Enron claim. We also experienced lower gas production in 2002 compared to 2001. Operating costs from continuing operations remained flat in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting lower maintenance costs that were offset by higher administrative costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for continuing operations increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to a higher depletion rate on the fields we retained. Net revenues for continuing operations increased in 2001 compared to 2000, due to higher natural gas and oil prices and the $7.9 million negative impact of hedging activities in 2000. Operating costs increased in 2001 as compared with 2000 as a result of higher production taxes. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased in 2001 compared to 2000 due to increased production and a slightly higher average depletion rate. Other income, net in 2001 primarily represents the gain from the sale of the Companys 40 percent interest in K. Stewart. Income from the discontinued component is significantly lower in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the lower gas prices received in 2002 compared to 2001. Income from the discontinued component is higher in 2001 compared to 2000 due to the higher gas prices received in 2001 compared to 2000 and due to higher losses from gas hedges in 2000 compared to 2001. The Production segment added 15.2 Bcfe of net reserves in 2002 related to the retained properties, including 9.3 Bcfe of proved developed, comprised of 6.1 Bcfe of proved developed producing and 3.2 Bcfe of proved non producing. Other 41 Table of Contents adjustments, primarily revision of prior estimates, reduced the year end reserves of retained wells by 11.6 Bcfe. Production for the year ended December 31, 2002, on retained wells was 9.0 Bcfe. Reserve additions for the discontinued component totaled 11.8 Bcfe of net reserves in 2002, of which 9.9 Bcfe were proved developed, made up of 8.3 Bcfe of proved developed producing and 1.6 Bcfe of proved non producing. Other adjustments, primarily revisions of prior estimates, reduced the year end reserves for the discontinued component by an additional 24.1 Bcfe. Production for the year ended December 31, 2002, for the discontinued component was 19.5 Bcfe. Capital expenditures primarily relate to the drilling program, which consisted of drilling costs. Capital expenditures related to the drilling program for continuing operations were approximately $15.3 million, $19.2 million, and $16.7 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Capital expenditures related to the drilling program for discontinued component were $19.8 million, $34.0 million, and $16.1 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Risk Management The volatility of energy prices has a significant impact on the profitability of this segment. We utilized derivative instruments in 2002 in order to hedge anticipated sales of natural gas and oil production. During the third quarter of 2002, we lifted our natural gas production hedges through December 2004 and fixed the gain on the derivative instruments previously in place related to our natural gas production. We recognize the benefit from the fixed gain as each contract month expires. In 2002, we recognized $3.9 million in natural gas sales revenues related to these hedges. The fixed gains associated with these natural gas production hedges have been deferred in other comprehensive income and will be realized in the month that the natural gas production occurs. At December 31, 2002, the Production segment had hedged 72 percent of its anticipated gas production and 62 percent of its anticipated oil production for fiscal year 2003 at a weighted average wellhead price of $4.60 per Mcf for gas and $27.25 per Bbl for oil. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources General A part of our strategy is to grow through acquisitions that strengthen and complement our existing assets. We have relied primarily on operating cash flow and borrowings from a combination of commercial paper, bank lines of credit, and capital markets for our liquidity and capital resource requirements. We expect to continue to use these sources, together with possible equity financings, such as our recent public common stock and equity unit offerings, for liquidity and capital resource needs on both a short and long term basis. During 2001 and 2002, our capital expenditures were financed through operating cash flows and short and long term debt. Financing is provided through our commercial paper program, long term debt and, as needed, through a revolving credit facility. Other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuance of equity, issuance of mandatory convertible debt securities, asset securitization and sale/leaseback of facilities. In August 2002, the Company announced that it had completed its tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding 8.44% Senior Notes due 2004 and the 8.32% Senior Notes due 2007 for a total purchase price of approximately $65 million. The total purchase price included a premium of approximately $2.9 million and consent fees of approximately $1.8 million to purchase the notes, which are reflected in interest expense in the income statement. In April 2002, the Company paid off $240 million of long term floating rate notes that were issued in 2000. Our credit rating is currently an A (stable outlook) by Standard and Poors and a Baa1 with a watch for possible downgrade by Moodys Investor Service. Our credit rating may be affected by a material change in our financial ratios or a material adverse event affecting our business. The most common criteria for assessment of our credit rating are the debt to capital ratio, pre tax and after tax interest debt coverage and liquidity. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, the interest rates on our commercial paper would increase, resulting in an increase in our cost to borrow funds. In the event that we are unable to borrow funds under our commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in our business, we have access to an $850 million revolving credit facility, which expires September 22, 2003. Our energy marketing and trading business relies upon the investment grade rating of our senior unsecured long term debt to satisfy credit support requirements with several counterparties. If our credit ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to participate in energy marketing and trading activity could be significantly limited. Without an investment grade rating, we would be required to fund margin requirements with the few counterparties with which we have Credit Support 42 Table of Contents Annex within our International Swaps and Derivatives Association Agreements with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments. At December 31, 2002, the total notional amount that could require such funding in the event of a credit rating decline to below investment grade is approximately $44.2 million. We have reviewed our commercial paper agreement, trust indentures, building leases, Bushton equipment leases, and marketing, trading and risk contracts and no rating triggers were identified. Rating triggers are defined as provisions that would create an automatic default or acceleration of indebtedness based on a change in our credit rating. The revolving credit agreement does contain a provision that would cause the cost to borrow funds to increase based on the amount borrowed under this agreement if our credit rating is negatively adjusted. This credit agreement also contains a default provision based on a material adverse change, but an adverse rating change is not defined as a default or material adverse change. We currently do not have any funds borrowed under this agreement. We also have no material guarantees of debt or other commitments to unaffiliated parties. We are subject to commodity price volatility. Significant fluctuations in commodity price in either physical or financial energy contracts may impact our overall liquidity due to the impact the commodity price change has on items such as the cost of gas held in storage, recoverability and timing of recovery of regulated natural gas costs, increased margin requirements, collectibility of certain energy related receivables and working capital. We believe that our current commercial paper program and debt capacity are adequate to meet our liquidity requirements associated with commodity price volatility. Our pension plan is currently overfunded resulting in an asset reported on the balance sheet. Due to the poor performance of the equity market and lower interest rates, the market value of our pension fund assets has decreased and, accordingly, our pension benefit for our pension and supplemental retirement plans will decrease in 2003 from $20.8 million to $7.0 million. Should the value of our pension fund assets fall below our Accumulated Benefit Obligation, we would eliminate the asset and record a minimum pension liability on the balance sheet with the difference flowing through other comprehensive income, net of tax. We believe we have adequate resources to fund our obligations under our pension plan as deemed necessary. During 2001, we put in place a stock buyback plan for up to 10 percent of our capital stock. The program authorized us to make purchases of our common stock on the open market with the timing and terms of purchases and the number of shares purchased to be determined by management based on market conditions and other factors. The purchased shares were held in treasury and available for general corporate purposes, funding of stock based compensation plans, and resale at a future date or retirement. This plan expired in 2002. At that time, we had not purchased any stock under the plan. Westar On January 9, 2003, we entered into an agreement with Westar Energy, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Westar Industries, Inc., to repurchase a portion of the shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A) held by Westar and to exchange Westars remaining 10.9 million shares of Series A for 21.8 million newly created shares of ONEOKs $0.925 Series D Non Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (Series D). The Series A shares were convertible into two shares of common stock, reflecting the two for one stock split in 2001, and the Series D shares are convertible into one share of common stock. The Series D has substantially the same terms as the Series A, except that (a) the Series D has a fixed annual cash dividend of 92.5 cents per share, (b) the Series D is redeemable by us at any time after August 1, 2006, at a redemption price of $20, in the event that the closing price of our common stock exceeds $25 for 30 consecutive trading days, (c) each share of Series D is convertible into one share of our common stock, and (d) Westar may not convert any shares of Series D held by it unless the annual per share dividend for our common stock for the previous year is greater than 92.5 cents per share and such conversion would not subject us to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Our new shareholder agreement also restricts Westar from selling more than five percent to any one person or to a group that already owns five percent or more of our common stock. The KCC approved our agreement with Westar on January 17, 2003. On February 5, 2003, we consummated the agreement by purchasing $300 million, or approximately 9 million shares (or approximately 18.1 million shares of common stock after the effects of the previous two for one stock split) of our Series A from Westar. We exchanged Westars remaining 10.9 million Series A shares for approximately 21.8 million shares of our newly created Series D. Also, in connection with that transaction, a new rights agreement, a new shareholder agreement and a new registration rights agreement became effective. In addition, we agreed to register for resale, within 60 days after the February 5, 2003 closing, all of the shares of our common stock held by Westar, as well as all the shares of our Series D issued to Westar and all of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D. As a result of this transaction and our recently completed common stock offering, Westars ownership interest in our company has been reduced from approximately 44.4 percent to approximately 27.4 percent on a fully diluted basis. Oklahoma Corporation Commission The OCC staff filed an application on February 1, 2001 to review the gas procurement practices of ONG in acquiring its gas supply for the 2000/2001 heating season to determine if these procurement practices were consistent with least cost procurement practices and whether ONGs decisions resulted in fair, just and 43 Table of Contents reasonable costs to its customers. On November 20, 2001, the OCC entered an order stating that ONG not be allowed to recover the balance in ONGs unrecovered purchased gas cost (UPGC) account related to the unrecovered gas costs from the 2000/2001 winter effective with the first billing cycle for the month following the issuance of a final order. This order halted ONGs recovery process effective December 1, 2001. On December 12, 2001, the OCC approved a request to stay the order and allowed ONG to begin collecting unrecovered gas costs, subject to refund had ONG ultimately lost the case. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of $34.6 million as a result of this OCC order. In April 2002, we, along with the staff of the Public Utility Division and the Consumer Services Division of the OCC, the Oklahoma Attorney General, and other stipulating parties filed a joint stipulation agreement proposing settlement of this and other issues. A hearing with the OCC was held in May 2002 and an order approving the settlement was issued at that time. As a result, we recorded a $14.2 million recovery in the second quarter of 2002 and have the potential of an additional $8.0 million recovery before December 2005 depending upon the potential value that could be generated by gas storage savings. Enron Enron North America was the counterparty in certain of the financial instruments discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001. Enron Corporation and various subsidiaries, including Enron North America, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on December 3, 2001. In 2001, we recorded a charge of $37.4 million to provide an allowance for forward financial positions and to establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts related to previously settled financial and physical positions with Enron. In the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a recovery of approximately $14.0 million as a result of an agreement to sell our Enron claim to a third party, which is subject to normal representations as to the validity, but not the collectibility, of the claims and the guarantees from Enron. The filing of the voluntary bankruptcy proceeding by Enron created a possible technical default related to various financing leases tied to our Bushton gas processing plant in south central Kansas. We acquired the Bushton gas processing plant and related leases from Kinder Morgan in April 2000. Kinder Morgan had previously acquired the plant and leases from Enron. Enron is one of three guarantors of these Bushton plant leases; however, we are the primary guarantor. In January 2002, we were granted a waiver on the possible technical default related to these leases. We will continue to make all payments due under these leases. Cash Flow Analysis Operating Cash Flows We had a significant increase in earnings in 2002 compared to 2001. In addition, the changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable are primarily due to an increase in energy trading revenues, net. Energy trading revenues, net increased due to our use of storage and transport capacity to capture the significant intra month and regional price volatility. In 2002, we also diversified our marketing and trading portfolio to include crude oil and natural gas liquids. These increases were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable due to lower natural gas prices in 2002. In addition, we had a full year of operations of the electric generating plant in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in deferred income taxes is primarily due to increased mark to market income in 2002 compared to 2001 and additional tax depreciation taken in 2002. In 2001, the changes in cash flows provided by operating activities primarily reflect changes in working capital accounts, deferred income taxes and price risk management assets and liabilities. The increase in deferred income taxes is primarily due to accelerated depreciation in 2001. The increase in price risk management assets and liabilities is primarily due to the Marketing and Trading segments gas in storage, which is included in price risk management assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The level of gas held in storage is higher at December 31, 2001, compared to December 31, 2000, due to warmer weather in 2001. Cash flow from operating activities was positively impacted in 2001 due to the reduction of accounts receivable, which was partially offset by increased cash used for payment of accounts payable and gas in storage and reduced recovery of unrecovered purchased gas costs. Receivables and payables were higher than normal at December 31, 2000, due to higher gas prices and the integration of the businesses acquired in 2000. In 2000, the changes in cash flow provided by operating activities primarily reflect changes in working capital accounts and an increase in price risk management assets and liabilities. The significant changes in working capital accounts, including accounts receivable, gas in storage, accounts payable and deferred credits and other liabilities is primarily a result of the acquisitions and the increase in operations resulting from those acquisitions in 2000 and historically higher gas prices. The increase in price risk management activities is due to the adoption of mark to market accounting in 2000. Investing Cash Flows Proceeds from the sale of property include approximately $92 million related to the sale of some of our midstream natural gas assets to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation, a private, independent oil and gas company. Proceeds from the sale of equity investments represent the sale of our interest in MHR in 2002. 44 Table of Contents Capital expenditures in 2001 and 2000 include approximately $42.3 million and $58.7 million, respectively, for the construction of the electric generating plant. In 2001, we were reimbursed by an unaffiliated company for approximately $14 million of the costs incurred to construct a pipeline in the Transportation and Storage segment. Due to regulatory treatment, this amount is recorded as a deferred credit in the balance sheet and amortized to income. We also received approximately $7.9 million related to the sale of assets in the Production segment in 2001. Acquisitions in 2001 include $14.5 million of purchase price adjustments, which resulted in an increase to goodwill, relating to the Kinder Morgan acquisitions. Financing Cash Flows Our capitalization structure is 47 percent equity and 53 percent long term debt at December 31, 2002, compared to 42 percent equity and 58 percent long term debt at December 31, 2001. Our capitalization structure including notes payable is 43 percent equity and 57 percent total debt at December 31, 2002, compared to 35 percent equity and 65 percent total debt at December 31, 2001. The change in our capital structure is primarily due to the retirement of approximately $300 million of long term debt and $335 million of notes payable and earnings in excess of dividends in 2002. At December 31, 2002, $1.5 billion of long term debt, including current maturities, was outstanding. As of that date, we could have issued $1.1 billion of additional long term debt under the most restrictive provisions contained in our various borrowing agreements. The Board of Directors has authorized up to $1.2 billion of short term financing to be procured as necessary for our operations. We have an $850 million Revolving Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A. and other financial institutions with a maturity date of September 22, 2003. This credit facility is primarily used to support the commercial paper program. At December 31, 2002, $265.5 million of commercial paper was outstanding. In April 2001, we issued a $400 million, ten year, fixed rate note to refinance short term debt. In July 2001, we entered into interest rate swaps on debt with a term equal to the term of the notes. The interest rate under these swaps resets periodically based on the three month London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the six month LIBOR at the reset date. In October 2001, we entered into an agreement to lock in the interest rates for each reset period under the swap agreements through the first quarter of 2003. In January 2003, the rates were locked through the first quarter of 2004. In December 2001, we entered into interest rate swaps on a total of $200 million in fixed rate long term debt through the term of the note. The interest rate under these swaps resets periodically based on the six month LIBOR at the reset date. The average interest rate of the $600 million in notes is 6.971 percent. Under the current swap agreements, the average interest rate of the notes is an all in LIBOR rate of approximately 3.516 percent. The all in LIBOR rate refers to the average LIBOR rate plus or minus the ONEOK basis spread for all swaps. The swaps resulted in approximately $20.6 million of interest savings in 2002 and are expected to generate an estimated $23.0 million in interest savings in 2003. On July 18, 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 for the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock and debt securities in one or more offerings with an aggregate offering price of up to $500 million. On December 20, 2002, we amended the shelf registration statement on Form S 3 to increase the aggregate offering price of securities to be issued under the shelf registration statement to $1.0 billion and to add some additional securities, including preferred stock, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units. On January 12, 2003, we announced plans for concurrent offerings of our common stock and equity units under our $1.0 billion shelf registration statement. On January 28, 2003, we issued 12 million shares of common stock at the public offering price of $17.19 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $16.524 per share, or $198.3 million in the aggregate. We granted the underwriters a 30 day over allotment option to purchase up to an additional 1.8 million shares of our common stock at the same price, which was exercised on February 7, 2003, at the same price per share, resulting in additional net proceeds to us of $29.7 million. Also, on January 28, 2003, we issued 14 million equity units at a public offering price of $25 per unit, resulting in net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $24.25 per share, or $339.5 million in the aggregate. An over allotment option allowing the purchase of an additional 2.1 million equity units was exercised on January 31, 2003, increasing the net proceeds to $390.4 million. Each equity unit consists of a stock purchase contract for the purchase of shares of our common stock and, initially, a senior note due February 16, 2008, issued pursuant to our existing Indenture with SunTrust Bank, as trustee. The equity units carry a total annual coupon rate of 8.5% (4.0% annual face amount of the senior notes plus 4.5% annual contract adjustment payments). Each stock purchase contract issued as a part of the equity units carries a maximum conversion premium of up to 20 percent over the $17.19 closing price of our common stock on January 22, 2003, and a floor of $17.19 per share. 45 Table of Contents In February 2003, $300 million of the proceeds from these offerings was used to repurchase approximately 9 million shares, or 18.1 million shares of common stock after the effects of the previous two for one stock split of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from Westar. The remaining 10.9 million shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock owned by Westar were exchanged for approximately 21.8 million shares of ONEOKs $0.925 Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. The Series A shares were convertible into two shares of common stock, reflecting the two for one stock split in 2001, and the Series D shares are convertible into one share of common stock. The Series D Convertible Preferred Stock has an annual dividend rate of $0.925 per share. Because the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock does not participate in earnings above the amount of the stated dividend rate, we will not be required to apply the provisions of EITF Topic D 95 beginning in February 2003. Under Topic D 95, we were required to reduce EPS by the dilutive effect of the two class method of EPS computation. Both Standard and Poors and Moodys Investment Services consider the equity units to be part equity and part debt. For purposes of computing capitalization ratios, these rating agencies adjust the capitalization structure. Standard and Poors considers the equity units to be equal amounts of debt and equity for the first three years, with the effect being to increase shareholders equity by the same amount as debt. Moodys Investment Services considers 25 percent of the equity units to be debt and 75 percent to be shareholders equity. The following table sets forth the actual capitalization structure at December 31, 2002, the capitalization structure had the common stock and equity units issued under the concurrent offerings been issued on December 31, 2002, and the capitalization structure as it would be adjusted by Standard and Poors (S&P). The proceeds from the common stock and equity issuances were used to repurchase $300 million of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from Westar and to pay off commercial paper as reflected in the table below.

The table set forth above does not include $402.5 million of long term debt incurred in connection with our public offering of equity units in January 2003. Operating leases and purchase commitments, rights of way and other include approximately $0.5 million and $2.2 million for 2008, respectively, of annual commitments, but are not included in the above table beyond 2008 due to the impracticality of calculating the future commitment. Purchase commitments exclude commodity purchase contracts. The Distribution segment is party to fixed price transportation contracts. However, the costs associated with these contracts are recovered through rates as allowed by the applicable regulatory agency and are excluded from the above table. Trading Activities Forwards, swaps, options, and energy transportation and storage contracts utilized for trading activities are reflected at fair value as assets and liabilities from price risk management activities in the consolidated balance sheets. The amounts include the cost of gas in storage, option premiums and the mark to market component (fair value). We utilize third party references for pricing points from NYMEX and third party over the counter brokers to establish the commodity pricing and volatility curves used in our valuation method to establish fair value. We believe the reported transactions from these sources are the most reflective of current market prices. Fair values are subject to change based on valuation factors. The following table sets forth the fair value component of the price risk management assets and liabilities, which result from the Marketing and Trading segments energy trading portfolio. 47 Table of Contents Fair Value Component of Price Risk Management Assets and Liabilities (Thousands of Dollars) Net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2001 $ 59,612 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period 92,004 Fair value of new contracts when entered into during the period (3,683 ) Changes in fair values attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions Other changes in fair value (45,766 ) Net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002 $ 102,167 The net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002 includes energy trading contracts accounted for under mark to market accounting. The net fair value of contracts outstanding includes the effect of settled energy contracts and current period charges resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of price movements on the fair value of price risk management assets and liabilities attributable to the Marketing and Trading segments activities. The following table sets forth the Marketing and Trading segments maturity of energy trading contracts based on heating injection and withdrawal periods from April through March. This maturity schedule is consistent with the Marketing and Trading segments business strategy. The Marketing and Trading segment has contracted over 39 Bcf of storage with an affiliate, which is excluded from outstanding fair value at December 31, 2002, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

These fair values are reflected as a component of assets and liabilities from price risk management activities in the consolidated balance sheets. (2) Values are derived from energy market price quotes from national commodity trading exchanges that primarily trade future and option commodity contracts. (3) Values are obtained through energy commodity brokers or electronic trading platforms, whose primary service is to match willing buyers and sellers of energy commodities. Because of the large energy broker network, energy price information by location is readily available. (4) Values primarily include natural gas storage and transportation capacity. Values derived in this category utilize market price information from the two other categories as well as other modeling assumptions that include, among others, assumptions for liquidity, credit, time value, volatility and other external attributes. Values attributable to storage models are determined on a heating injection/withdrawal model.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (Statement 143). Statement 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Statement 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting Statement 143 and our preliminary assessment indicates that it will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections (Statement 145). Statement 145 rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt (Statement 4), and an amendment to that Statement, FASB Statement No. 64 Extinguishment of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking Fund Requirements (Statement 64). Statement 145 also rescinds FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases (Statement 13) to eliminate the inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions. Statement 145 also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The provisions of Statement 145 related to the rescission of Statement 4 are effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The provisions of Statement 145 related to Statement 13 are effective prospectively for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. All other provisions of Statement 145 are effective prospectively for financial statements issued on or after May 15, 2002. In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Restructuring Costs (Statement 146). Under Statement 146, a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value. Statement 146 also provides guidance on accounting for specified employee and contract terminations that are part of restructuring activities. Statement 146 is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. In July 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF Issues No. 02 3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF 02 3). EITF 02 3 provides that all mark to market gains and losses on energy trading contracts be presented on a net basis (energy contract sales less energy contract costs) in the income statement without regard to the settlement provisions of the contract. An entity should disclose the gross transaction volumes for those energy trading contracts that are physically settled. We adopted these provisions of EITF 02 3 in the third quarter of 2002. In October 2002, the EITF rescinded EITF 98 10. As a result, energy related contracts that are not accounted for pursuant to Statement 133 will no longer be carried at fair value, but rather will be accounted for as executory contracts and accounted for on an accrual basis. As a result of the rescission of this statement, the Task Force also agreed that energy trading 49 Table of Contents inventories carried under storage agreements should no longer be carried at fair value but should be carried at the lower of cost or market. The rescission is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after December 31, 2002 and for all existing energy trading contracts and inventory as of October 25, 2002. Additionally, the rescission applies immediately to contracts entered into on or after October 25, 2002. Changes to the accounting for existing contracts as a result of the rescission of EITF 98 10 will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. At this time, we estimate this will result in a cumulative effect loss, net of tax, of approximately $141.0 million. Any impact from this change will be non cash. All recoveries of the estimated value associated with this change in accounting will be recognized in operating income in future periods. The impact of adopting the rescission of EITF 98 10 will be included in the March 31, 2003 financial statements. The following table details the estimated recovery of these values from the rescission in future periods. The estimates are based on prices at January 31, 2003 and are subject to change.

FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements in FIN 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. We do not expect FIN 45 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Refer to the general portion of our liquidity and capital resources section for further discussion of our guarantees. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (Statement 148). Statement 148 provides for alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, Statement 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (Statement 123), to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The provisions of Statement 148 relating to the alternative methods of transition in the adoption of Statement 123 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The provisions of Statement 148 relating to amended disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. We adopted the provisions related to the amended disclosure requirements in the 2002 consolidated financial statements. We adopted the provisions of Statements 123 effective January 1, 2003, and will apply these provisions to all employee stock options granted on or after January 1, 2003 in accordance with the transition alternative provided in Statement 148. The pro forma effect of applying the provisions to prior years is presented in Note A in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Related Party Transactions KGS has a shared service agreement with Westar, which is the holder of our preferred stock. The shared services include call center backup, meter readings, customer billing operations and customer service. In 2002, KGS made a net payment of approximately $5.0 million to Westar related to this shared service agreement. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet special purpose entities or asset securitization. 50 Table of Contents Uncollectible Amounts During 2001, the KCC issued an Order extending the time period for which gas service disconnection during inclement weather conditions cannot be made. Due to the extension of the time period restricting disconnections, delinquent KGS customers were allowed to continue gas service, thus increasing uncollectible amounts. Higher gas costs in the 2000/2001 heating season also contributed to the increased uncollectible amounts. KGS and other distribution companies in Kansas filed a joint application with the KCC seeking approval to recover the additional uncollectible amounts incurred during the 2000/2001 heating season until reviewed in the next rate case. The KCC approved the deferral allowing the companies to seek recovery of the extraordinary uncollectible account levels experienced in the 2000/2001 winter. KGS filed a rate case in January 2003. No accounting treatment has yet been determined. Southwest Gas Corporation Information related to litigation arising out of the termination of our effort to acquire Southwest Gas Corporation is presented in Note M in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 3 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Hutchinson Litigation Two separate class action lawsuits have been filed against us in connection with the natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers that occurred in or near Hutchinson, Kansas in January 2001. Although no assurances can be given, management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Our insurance carrier in these cases is representing us. We are vigorously defending ourselves against all claims. For more information, see Legal Proceedings. Environmental We have 12 manufactured gas sites located in Kansas, which may contain potentially harmful materials that are classified as hazardous material. Hazardous materials are subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. A consent agreement with the KDHE presently governs all future work at these sites. The terms of the consent agreement allow us to investigate these sites and set remediation priorities based upon the results of the investigations and risk analysis. Remedial investigation has commenced on four sites. However, a comprehensive study is not complete and the results to date do not provide a sufficient basis for a reasonable estimation of the total liability. The liability accrued is reflective of an estimate of the total cost of remedial investigation and feasibility study. Through December 31, 2002, the costs of the investigations and risk analysis related to these manufactured gas sites have been immaterial. The site situations are not common and we have no previous experience with similar remediation efforts. The information currently available estimates the cost of remediation to range from $100,000 to $10 million per site based on a limited comparison of costs incurred by others to remediate comparable sites. As such, the information provides an insufficient basis to reasonably estimate a minimum range of our liability. These estimates do not give effect to potential insurance recoveries, recoveries through rates or from unaffiliated parties. At this time, we are not recovering any environmental amounts in rates. The KCC has permitted others to recover remediation costs through rates. It should be noted that additional information and testing could result in costs significantly below or in excess of the amounts estimated above. To the extent that such remediation costs are not recovered, the costs could be material to our results of operations and cash flows depending on the remediation done and number of years over which the remediation is completed. In January 2001, the Yaggy storage facilitys operating parameters were changed as mandated by the KDHE following natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers in or near Hutchison, Kansas. There are no known long term environmental effects from the Yaggy storage facility; however, we continue to perform tests in cooperation with the KDHE. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Management We are, substantially through our non utility business segments, exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations and to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and power prices. Market risk refers to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in commodity energy prices. Our primary exposure arises from fixed price purchase or sale agreements that extend for periods of up to 48 months, gas in storage utilized by the marketing and trading operation, and anticipated sales of natural gas and oil production. To a lesser extent, we are exposed to risk of changing prices or the cost of intervening transportation resulting from purchasing gas at one location and selling it at another (referred to as basis risk). To minimize the risk from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, we use commodity derivative instruments such as futures contracts, swaps and options to manage market risk of existing or anticipated purchase and sale agreements, existing physical gas in storage, and basis risk. We adhere to policies and procedures that limit our exposure to market risk from open positions and that monitor market risk exposure. KGS uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of anticipated gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect KGS customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural gas. At December 31, 2002, KGS had derivative 51 Table of Contents instruments in place to hedge the cost of purchases for 46.5 Bcf of gas. This represents all of KGS gas purchase requirements for the winter 2002/2003 heating months based on normal weather conditions. Gains or losses associated with the KGS hedges are included in the purchased gas adjustment.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10 K. For further discussion of trading activities and models and assumptions used in the trading activities see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Also, see Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Rate Risk We are subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates in the normal course of business. We manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates. At December 31, 2002, the interest rate on 58.1 percent of our debt was fixed, after considering the effect of interest rate swaps. In July 2001, we entered into interest rate swaps on a total of $400 million in fixed rate long term debt. The interest rate under these swaps resets periodically based on the three month LIBOR or the six month LIBOR at the reset date. In October 2001, we entered into an agreement to lock in the interest rates for each reset period under the swap agreements through the first quarter of 2003. In December 2001, we entered into additional interest rate swaps on a total of $200 million in fixed rate long term debt. In January 2003, the rates were locked through the first quarter of 2004. The swaps resulted in approximately $20.6 million of interest rate savings in 2002 and will result in an estimated $23.0 million in savings during 2003. In December 2002, we recorded a $79.0 million net increase in price risk management assets to recognize at fair value our derivatives that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Long term debt was increased by approximately $78.3 million to recognize the change in fair value of the related hedged liability. At December 31, 2002 a hypothetical 100 basis point move in the annual interest rate would change our annual interest expense by $4.7 million before taxes. This amount is limited based on the LIBOR locks that we have in place through the first quarter of 2004. If these locks were not in place, a 100 basis point change in the interest rates would affect our annual interest expense by $8.7 million before taxes. This 100 basis point change assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. If interest rates changed significantly, we would take actions to manage our exposure to the change. Since a specific action and the possible effects are uncertain, no change has been assumed. Value at Risk Disclosure of Market Risk We measure entity wide market risk in our trading, price risk management, and our non trading portfolios using value at risk (VAR). Our VAR calculations are based on the Risk Works Monte Carlo approach, assuming a one day holding period. We began using the Monte Carlo approach in the second quarter of 2002. Prior to that time, we used the variance co variance approach. The quantification of market risk using VAR provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance, to determine risk targets and set position limits. The use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions, including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation. Inputs to the calculation include prices, positions, instrument valuations and the variance co variance matrix. Historical data is used to estimate our VAR with more weight given to recent data, which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements. We rely on VAR to determine the potential reduction in the trading and price risk management portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period. While management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable, no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating VAR and different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different VAR estimates. Our VAR exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized for our trading and price risk management portfolio of derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and gas in storage due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon within a specified confidence level. A one day time horizon and a 95 percent confidence level were used in our VAR data. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the VAR calculation based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices, operating exposures and timing thereof, and the changes in the Companys trading and price risk management portfolio of derivative financial instruments and physical contracts. VAR information should be evaluated in light of this information and the methodologys other limitations. 52 Table of Contents The potential impact on our future earnings, as measured by the VAR, was $3.2 million and $5.1 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The following table details the average, high and low VAR calculations: Years Ended December 31, Value at Risk 2002 2001 (Millions of dollars) Average $ 5.0 $ 3.6 High $ 17.8 $ 8.7 Low $ 1.2 $ 0.7 The variations in the VAR data are reflective of our marketing and trading growth and market volatility during the year. Risk Policy and Oversight We control the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. Our Board of Directors affirms the risk limit parameters with our audit committee having oversight responsibilities for the policies. A risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price, credit and interest rate risk management, marketing and trading activities. The committee also proposes risk metrics including VAR and position loss limits. We have a corporate risk control organization lead by the Vice President of Risk Control, who is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies, procedures and limits and evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions. Key risk control activities include credit review and approval, credit and performance risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics. To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably. As a result, we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position. 53 Table of Contents

The following table details the average, high and low VAR calculations: Years Ended December 31, Value at Risk 2002 2001 (Millions of dollars) Average $ 5.0 $ 3.6 High $ 17.8 $ 8.7 Low $ 1.2 $ 0.7 The variations in the VAR data are reflective of our marketing and trading growth and market volatility during the year. Risk Policy and Oversight We control the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. Our Board of Directors affirms the risk limit parameters with our audit committee having oversight responsibilities for the policies. A risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price, credit and interest rate risk management, marketing and trading activities. The committee also proposes risk metrics including VAR and position loss limits. We have a corporate risk control organization lead by the Vice President of Risk Control, who is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies, procedures and limits and evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions. Key risk control activities include credit review and approval, credit and performance risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics. To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably. As a result, we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position. 53 Table of Contents
