ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Summary We are a diversified energy company with nearly a century of experience in the natural gas business. Since 1906, we have grown from an Oklahoma intrastate natural gas pipeline business to a company providing natural gas services from the wellhead to the burner tip throughout the mid continent area of the United States with a recent expansion into Canada. To achieve this diversity, we have built a combination of regulated and nonregulated businesses. We are the largest natural gas distributor in Kansas and Oklahoma and the third largest in Texas. We serve almost 2 million customers through our Distribution segments operations. After serving Oklahoma customers for over 90 years, the substantial growth in this segment began with the acquisition of the Kansas distribution assets in 1997. In January 2003, we completed the acquisition of the Texas gas distribution system which currently serves 544,000 customers. Our conservative practice of trading around assets we own has allowed for a successful marketing and trading business built around a strong mid continent region storage and transport position which provides us direct access to most regions of the country and flexibility to capture volatility in the energy markets. The production and midstream businesses complete the operation with each piece adding value to the other pieces resulting in a powerful asset mix. We saw a positive change in 2003 with the repurchase and exchange of our Series A preferred stock, a stock that held participating rights in our undistributed earnings. This repurchase eliminated the dilutive effect resulting from computing earnings per share under Topic D 95. Additionally, all of the Series D issued in exchange for the Series A was converted by the end of 2003 to common stock and was then cancelled. These actions resulted in a capital structure consisting of only common stock that is more consistent with the capital structures of our peer companies. The elimination of our Series A and Series D, and the dividend requirements associated with both, has allowed us to increase our common dividend per share. The quarterly dividend per common share has increased from 15.5 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2002 to 19 cents per share currently, which is payable in the first quarter of 2004. In 2003, we also saw a change in accounting for our energy trading contracts not under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (Statement 133) and our energy trading 25 Table of Contents inventories carried under storage agreements. These are no longer carried at fair value, but rather are accounted for on an accrual basis. The impact of this change shifted earnings from the second and third quarters to the first and fourth quarters. Our strategy has not changed. It has been and continues to be one of maximizing shareholder value by acquiring assets that grow our operations into new market areas and complement our existing asset base, maximizing the earnings potential of existing assets and introducing regulatory initiatives that benefit us and our customers. In addition to earnings per share, other key indicators that we use to evaluate our success are return on invested capital and shareholder appreciation as compared to our peer companies. Acquisitions and Divestitures On February 25, 2004, we announced an agreement with ConocoPhillips to purchase a 22.5 percent general partnership interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators (GFC), which owns a natural gas liquids fractionation facility located in Mont Belvieu, Texas for $23 million, subject to adjustments. The pending acquisition is subject to the customary closing conditions, the consent of the partners, and agreement by the partners that we will replace ConocoPhillips as operator of the facility. By existing agreement, the GFC partners have a preferential right to purchase the ConocoPhillips interest at the same terms as agreed to by us. This preferential right expires March 31, 2004. This facility has a fractionation capacity of 110 MBbls/d of mixed NGLs. As the operator, we will operate the facility and control approximately 24.8 MBbls/d of fractionation capacity. The acquisition is expected to close in April 2004 and is estimated to add $1.8 million to operating income in 2004. On March 1, 2004, we completed a transaction to sell certain natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines and compression for approximately $13 million. On December 22, 2003, we purchased approximately $240 million of Texas gas and oil properties and related flow lines from a partnership owned by Wagner & Brown, Ltd. of Midland, Texas. The results of operations for these assets have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. The acquisition included approximately 318 wells, 271 of which we operate, and 177.2 Bcfe of estimated proved gas and oil reserves as of the September 1, 2003 effective date, with additional probable and possible reserve potential. Net production from these properties is approximately 26,000 Mcfe per day. In December 2003, we acquired NGL storage and pipeline facilities located in Conway, Kansas for approximately $13.7 million from ChevronTexaco. In the prior two years we had leased and operated these facilities. In October 2003, we completed a transaction to sell certain Texas transmission assets for a sales price of approximately $3.1 million. A charge against accumulated depreciation for approximately $7.8 million was recorded in accordance with Statement 71 and the regulatory accounting requirements of the FERC and TRC. In August 2003, we acquired the gas distribution system at the United States Armys Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas for $2.4 million. The gas distribution system at Fort Bliss serves approximately 2,500 customers. In August 2003, we acquired a pipeline system that extends through the Rio Grande Valley region in Texas for $3.6 million. The TGS pipeline system serves the city gate points for the TGS Rio Grande Valley service area, providing service to approximately 10 transport customers, two power plants and offers access to production wells that supply the area. In January 2003, we closed the sale of approximately 70 percent of the natural gas and oil producing properties of our Production segment for a cash sales price of $294 million, including adjustments. The properties sold were in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. The effective date of the sale was November 30, 2002. The sale included approximately 1,900 wells, 482 of which we operated. We recorded a pretax gain of approximately $61.2 million in 2003 related to this sale. The statistical and financial information related to the properties sold is reflected as a discontinued component in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All periods presented have been restated to reflect the discontinued component. On January 3, 2003, we purchased the Texas gas distribution business and other Texas assets from Southern Union. The results of operations for these assets have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. We paid approximately $436.6 million for these assets, including $16.6 million in working capital adjustments. The primary assets acquired were gas distribution operations that currently serve approximately 544,000 customers in cities located throughout Texas, including the major cities of El Paso and Austin, as well as the cities of Port Arthur, Galveston, Brownsville and others. Over 90 percent of the customers are residential. The other assets acquired include a 125 mile natural gas 26 Table of Contents transmission system, as well as other energy related domestic assets involved in gas marketing, retail sales of propane and distribution of propane. The purchase also included natural gas distribution investments in Mexico. The gas distribution assets are operated under TGS. On December 13, 2002, we closed the sale of a portion of our midstream natural gas assets for a cash sales price of approximately $92 million to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation, a private, independent oil and gas company. The assets that were sold are located in north central Oklahoma and include three natural gas processing plants and related gathering systems and our interest in a fourth natural gas processing plant. In December 2002, we sold our property rights in Sayre, a natural gas storage field, and entered into a long term agreement with the purchaser whereby we retain storage capacity consistent with our original ownership position. In early 2001, we increased our common ownership interest in MHR from approximately nine percent to over 21 percent through conversion of shares and redemption of MHR preferred stock to shares of MHR common stock, as well as exercising warrants. As a result, we began accounting for the MHR investment using the equity method of accounting. On March 15, 2002, MHR merged with Prize Energy Corp., which reduced our direct ownership to approximately 11 percent and reduced the number of MHR board of director positions held by us from two to one. At that time, we began accounting for our investment in MHR as an available for sale security and, accordingly, marked the investment to fair value through other comprehensive income. In the second quarter of 2002, we sold our remaining shares of MHR common stock for a pretax gain of approximately $7.6 million, which is included in the Other segments other income for the year ended December 31, 2002. We retained approximately 1.5 million stock purchase warrants. We also relinquished our remaining seat on MHRs board of directors. The MHR investment and related equity income and loss are reported in the Other segment. In June 2001, we sold our 40 percent interest in K. Stewart, a privately held exploration company, for a sales price of $7.7 million. Regulatory Several regulatory initiatives positively impacted the earnings and future earnings potential for the Distribution segment. These are discussed beginning on page 39. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We lease various buildings, facilities and equipment, which are accounted for as operating leases. We lease vehicles, which are accounted for as operating leases for financial purposes and capital leases for tax purposes. For a summary of scheduled future payments, see Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments on page 47. Other On January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (Statement 148) and began expensing the fair value of all stock options beginning with options granted on or after January 1, 2003 under the prospective method allowed by Statement 148. See Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for disclosure of our pro forma net income and earnings per share information had we applied the fair value provisions for options granted for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and included in this report on Form 10 K. Certain amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosure must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. Therefore, the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. We believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others, as discussed below. Energy Trading Derivatives and Risk Management Activities We engage in wholesale marketing and trading, price risk management activities and asset optimization services. In providing asset optimization services, we partner with other utilities to provide risk management functions on their behalf. We account for derivative instruments utilized in connection with these activities under the fair value basis of accounting in accordance with Statement 133 as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133 (Statement 137), No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and 27 Table of Contents Certain Hedging Activities (Statement 138) and No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (Statement 149). We were not impacted by Statement 149. Under Statement 133, entities are required to record all derivative instruments in price risk management assets and liabilities at fair value. A number of assumptions are considered in the determination of fair value. Our derivatives are primarily concentrated in exchange traded and over the counter markets where quoted prices in liquid markets exist. Transactions are also executed in exchange traded or over the counter markets for which market prices may exist but the market may be relatively inactive thereby resulting in limited price transparency that requires managements subjectivity in estimating fair values. Other factors impacting our estimates of fair value include volatility, time value, counterparty credit and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions. Refer to the table on page 48 for amounts in our portfolio at December 31, 2003 which were determined by prices actively quoted (exchange traded), prices provided by other external sources (over the counter), and prices derived from other sources. The gain or loss from changes in fair value is recorded in the period of the change. The volatility of commodity prices may have a significant impact on the gain or loss in any given period. For more information on fair value sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Energy related contracts that are not accounted for pursuant to Statement 133 are no longer carried at fair value, but are accounted for on an accrual basis as executory contracts. Energy trading inventories carried under storage agreements are no longer carried at fair value, but are carried at the lower of cost or market. Changes to the accounting for existing contracts as a result of the rescission of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF 98 10) were reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. This resulted in a cumulative effect loss, net of tax, of $141.8 million. Regulation Our intrastate transmission pipelines and distribution operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the OCC, KCC, TRC and various municipalities in Texas. Certain of our other transportation activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. ONG, KGS, TGS and portions of the Transportation and Storage segment follow the accounting and reporting guidance contained in Statement 71. During the rate making process, regulatory authorities may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred. This allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery. Accordingly, actions of the regulatory authorities could have an affect on the amount recovered from rate payers. Any difference in the amount recoverable and the amount deferred would be recorded as income or expense at the time of the regulatory action. If all or a portion of the regulated operations becomes no longer subject to the provision of Statement 71, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. At December 31, 2003, our regulatory assets totaled $213.9 million. Impairment of Goodwill and Long Lived Assets We assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (Statement 142). An initial assessment is made by comparing the fair value of the operations with goodwill, as determined in accordance with Statement 142, to the book value. If the fair value is less than the book value, an impairment is indicated and we must perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment. In the second test, we calculate the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the operations with goodwill from the fair value determined in step one of the assessment. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds this calculated implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded. See Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. We assess our long lived assets for impairment based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (Statement 144). A long lived asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may exceed its fair value. Fair values are based on sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. Examples of long lived asset impairment indicators include: significant and long term declines in commodity prices a major accident affecting the use of an asset part or all of a regulated business no longer operating under Statement 71 a significant decrease in the rate of return for a regulated business Pension and Postretirement Employee Benefits We have a defined pension plan covering substantially all full time employees and a postretirement employee benefits plan covering most employees. Our actuarial consultant, in calculating 28 Table of Contents the expense and liability related to these plans, uses statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, age and employment periods. In determining the projected benefit obligations and the costs, assumptions can change from period to period and result in material changes in the costs and liabilities we recognize. See Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Contingencies Our accounting for contingencies covers a variety of business activities including contingencies for potentially uncollectible receivables, legal exposures and environmental exposures. We accrue these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We base our estimates on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution. Actual results may differ from our estimates resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on earnings. For further discussion of our accounting policies, see Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Consolidated Operations The following table sets forth certain selected financial information for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (Thousands of Dollars) Financial Results Operating revenues, excluding energy trading revenues $ 2,769,214 $ 1,894,851 $ 1,814,180 Energy trading revenues, net 229,782 209,429 101,761 Cost of gas 1,862,518 1,128,620 1,089,566 Net revenues 1,136,478 975,660 826,375 Operating costs 529,553 456,339 437,233 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 160,861 147,843 133,533 Operating income $ 446,064 $ 371,478 $ 255,609 Other income $ 8,164 $ 12,426 $ 9,852 Other expense $ 5,224 $ 19,038 $ 8,976 Discontinued operations, net of taxes (Note C) Income from discontinued component $ 2,342 $ 10,648 $ 24,879 Gain on sale of discontinued component $ 39,739 $ $ Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ (143,885 ) $ $ (2,151 ) Operating Results Changes in commodity prices can have a significant impact on our earnings, particularly in the Gathering and Processing segment. Volatility in prices, such as we experienced during the early part of 2003 due to the extremely cold weather, provides the opportunity for increased margins in our Marketing and Trading segment. Net revenues from continuing operations increased in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to: higher prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil contract restructuring in gathering and processing addition of our Texas gas distribution business implementation of KGS new rate schedule in September 2003 effective utilization of storage and transport capacity to capture daily price volatility Net revenues from continuing operations increased in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the: OCC actions including a $34.6 million charge to cost of gas in 2001 and a $14.2 million reduction in cost of gas in 2002 sale of the Enron bankruptcy claim in 2002 which increased net revenues by $10.4 million compared to the $37.4 million charge for the bankruptcy claim that was recorded in 2001 Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization increased in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to: 29 Table of Contents additional costs of operating our Texas gas distribution business and the additional assets acquired with that business higher bad debt expenses due to higher prices increased employee and administrative costs Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization increased in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to: additional costs associated with the operation of the NGL pipeline facilities which we leased at the end of 2001 settlement of legal proceedings increased employee costs The following tables show the components of other income and other expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

The discontinued component is discussed in the Production segment section and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is discussed in the Marketing and Trading segment section. Key Performance Indicators Key performance indicators reviewed by management include: earnings per share return on invested capital shareholder appreciation For the year ended December 31, 2003, our basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is $2.38 and $2.13, respectively, representing an 81.7 percent and 63.8 percent increase in basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared to 2002. Return on invested capital is 16.7 percent in 2003 compared to 13.0 percent in 2002. To evaluate shareholder appreciation, we compare ourselves to a group of 20 peer companies. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we ranked in the top 35th percentile in shareholder appreciation compared to our peers. Production Overview Our Production segment currently owns, develops and produces natural gas and oil reserves in Oklahoma and Texas. We focus on development activities rather than exploratory drilling. 30 Table of Contents As a result of our growth strategy through acquisitions and developmental drilling, the number of wells we operate increases as we grow our reserves. In our role as operator, we control operating decisions that impact production volumes and lifting costs. We continually focus on reducing finding costs and minimizing production costs. Acquisitions and Divestitures The following acquisitions and divestitures are discussed beginning on page 26: purchased gas and oil properties and related flow lines from a partnership owned by Wagner & Brown, Ltd. in December 2003 sold natural gas and oil producing properties in January 2003 sold our 40 percent interest in K. Stewart in June 2001 Development Activities Through our developmental drilling program we participated in drilling 20 wells in 2003, which included 19 producing gas wells and one dry hole. Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Production segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (Thousands of Dollars) Financial Results of Continuing Operations Natural gas sales $ 35,818 $ 25,693 $ 31,628 Oil sales 7,221 6,654 6,232 Other revenues 949 107 47 Net revenues 43,988 32,454 37,907 Operating costs 15,812 8,332 8,351 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 12,070 13,842 11,240 Operating income $ 16,106 $ 10,280 $ 18,316 Other income (expense), net $ 10 $ (178 ) $ 1,175 Discontinued operations, net of taxes (Note C) Income from discontinued component $ 2,342 $ 10,648 $ 24,879 Gain on sale of discontinued component $ 39,739 $ $ Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ 117 $ $ (2,151 ) 31 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Operating Information and Financial Statistics Proved reserves Continuing operations Gas (MMcf) 221,119 61,748 67,582 Oil (MBbls) 4,127 2,461 2,394 Discontinued component Gas (MMcf) 177,828 165,385 Oil (MBbls) 2,787 2,117 Production Continuing operations Gas (MMcf) 7,486 7,370 8,000 Oil (MBbls) 265 273 261 Discontinued component Gas (MMcf) 1,472 18,036 19,578 Oil (MBbls) 53 241 232 Average realized price (a) Continuing operations Gas ($/Mcf) $ 4.78 $ 3.49 $ 3.95 Oil ($/Bbls) $ 27.25 $ 24.37 $ 23.88 Discontinued component Gas ($/Mcf) $ 4.10 $ 3.19 $ 3.89 Oil ($/Bbls) $ 32.28 $ 25.00 $ 25.99 Capital expenditures (thousands) Continuing operations $ 18,655 $ 17,810 $ 20,429 Discontinued component $ $ 21,824 $ 35,545 (a) The average realized price reflects the impact of hedging activities. All proved undeveloped reserves are attributed to locations directly offsetting (adjacent to) productive units. Operating Results Net revenues from continuing operations increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to higher realized oil and gas prices which include the impact of hedging gains and losses. We experienced higher gas production from continuing operations in 2003 compared to 2002, reflecting a partial month of production on the acquired properties. Normal production declines on our gas wells were offset by the production from new wells drilled. Lower oil production in 2003 compared to 2002 resulted from normal production declines on existing wells as well as no new drilling and minimal acquisition of new wells. Operating costs from continuing operations are higher in 2003 compared to 2002, reflecting: higher production taxes that were the result of higher prices higher well operating costs due to maintenance and workovers higher administrative costs Depreciation, depletion and amortization for continuing operations declined in 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily to a lower depletion rate. With respect to retained properties, the Production segment added 15 Bcfe of net natural gas and oil reserves in 2003 from drilling activities. This included 9.9 Bcfe of proved developed reserves, comprised of 6.6 Bcfe of proved developed producing and 3.3 Bcfe of proved non producing. Production for 2003, including acquired properties for the period owned, was 9.1 Bcfe. Ten days of production for the acquired properties in Texas are included in 2003. Net revenues from continuing operations decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to: lower realized gas prices which include the impact of hedging gains and losses lower gas production volumes 32 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization for continuing operations increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to a higher depletion rate. In 2001, other income, net, primarily represents the gain from the sale of our 40 percent interest in K. Stewart. Discontinued Component Income from the discontinued component is significantly lower in 2003 compared to 2002 since the properties produced only one month in 2003 before they were sold. Lower gas prices received resulted in income from the discontinued component being lower in 2002 compared to 2001. Natural gas and oil reserve additions for the discontinued component totaled 11.8 Bcfe of net reserves in 2002. This included 9.9 Bcfe of proved developed reserves, comprised of 8.3 Bcfe of proved developed producing and 1.6 Bcfe of proved non producing. Other adjustments, primarily revisions of prior estimates, reduced the year end reserves for the discontinued component by an additional 24.1 Bcfe. Production for the year ended December 31, 2002 for the discontinued component was 19.5 Bcfe. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures primarily relate to our developmental drilling program. Production from existing wells naturally declines over time and additional drilling for existing wells is necessary to maintain or enhance production from existing reserves. Capital expenditures related to our drilling program for continuing operations were approximately $18.3 million, $15.3 million, and $19.2 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Capital expenditures related to our drilling program for the discontinued component were $19.8 million and $34.0 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Risk Management The volatility of energy prices has a significant impact on the profitability of this segment. We utilized derivative instruments in 2003 in order to hedge anticipated sales of natural gas and oil production. The realized financial impact of the derivative transactions is included in net revenues. For 2003, we hedged approximately 78 percent of our natural gas production at an average net price at the wellhead of $4.50 per MMBtu, and 79 percent of our oil production at a fixed NYMEX price of $27.25 per Bbl. At December 31, 2003, we have hedged approximately 89 percent of our anticipated 2004 natural gas production and 89 percent of our anticipated 2004 oil production. The weighted average wellhead price for gas hedges is $5.28 per MMBtu, and the net oil hedge NYMEX price is $30.35 per Bbl. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Gathering and Processing Overview The Gathering and Processing segment is engaged in the gathering, processing and marketing of natural gas and the fractionation, storage and marketing of NGLs. Our Gathering and Processing segment has a processing capacity of approximately 2.0 Bcf/d, of which approximately 0.2 Bcf/d is currently idle. Our Gathering and Processing segment owns approximately 13,800 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plants. Strategy The price of natural gas relative to the price of NGLs can be an important factor in determining the profitability of processing gas and extracting its various liquid components. We have been successful in amending contracts covering about 10 to 15 percent of the volume associated with our keep whole contracts to allow us to charge conditioning fees for processing when the price of natural gas relative to NGLs becomes too high. This change helps mitigate the impact of unfavorable spreads between the two commodities. Our effort to add this conditioning language began in 2002 and remains a strategy that we continue to pursue today. Our goal is to have this conditioning language in contracts covering 75 percent of our keep whole volumes within five years. We are also continuing the strategy of restructuring unprofitable gas purchase and gathering contracts. Additionally, we are able to modify plant operations to take advantage of market conditions. By changing operations such as rerouting gas around or through the plant or changing the temperatures and pressures at which the gas is processed, we can produce more of the specific commodities that have the most favorable pricing condition. These strategies are intended to increase the stability of our net revenues. Acquisitions and Divestitures The following acquisitions and divestitures are described beginning on page 26: signed an agreement to acquire a 22.5 percent partnership interest in a Texas general partnership, which owns a natural gas liquids fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas, and is expected to close in April 2004 acquired a retail propane business as part of the purchase of our Texas assets in January 2003 acquired NGL storage and pipeline facilities located in Conway, Kansas in December 2003 sold three natural gas processing plants and related gathering assets along with our interest in a fourth natural gas processing plant in December 2002 33 Table of Contents Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Gathering and Processing segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (Thousands of Dollars) Financial Results Natural gas liquids and condensate sales $ 1,041,764 $ 654,930 $ 587,842 Gas sales 640,499 380,095 635,569 Gathering, compression, dehydration andprocessing fees and other revenues 96,254 98,196 91,406 Cost of sales 1,564,380 938,843 1,125,196 Net revenues 214,137 194,378 189,621 Operating costs 122,103 127,747 116,853 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 29,332 33,523 29,201 Operating income $ 62,702 $ 33,108 $ 43,567 Other income (expense), net $ (194 ) $ (1,119 ) $ (178 ) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ (1,375 ) $ $ Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Operating and Financial Statistics Total gas gathered (MMMBtu/d) 1,171 1,205 1,331 Total gas processed (MMMBtu/d) 1,209 1,411 1,420 Natural gas liquids sales (MBbls/d) 114 95 76 Natural gas liquids produced (MBbls/d) 59 73 74 Gas sales (MMMBtu/d) 330 343 391 Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 20,598 $ 43,101 $ 51,442 Conway OPIS composite NGL Price ($/gal) (based on our NGL product mix) $ 0.59 $ 0.41 $ 0.48 Average NYMEX crude oil price ($/Bbl) $ 30.98 $ 25.41 $ 26.60 Average natural gas price ($/MMBtu) (mid continent region) $ 5.06 $ 3.00 $ 4.16 Operating Results For 2003 compared to 2002, increased prices for NGLs, natural gas and crude oil contributed to increases in: natural gas liquids and condensate sales revenues gas sales cost of sales net revenues The increased prices positively impacted net revenues by $32.6 million for 2003 compared to 2002. Our contractual restructuring efforts and our new Texas propane business also added about $16.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively, to 2003 net revenues. These net revenue increases were partially offset by the decrease of $19.4 million that resulted from the sale of the Oklahoma processing plant and gathering assets in the fourth quarter of 2002 and an approximate $9.5 million decrease that was the result of lower gas and NGL volumes processed in 2003. The volume decreases resulted primarily from natural well declines. The decreases in operating costs for 2003 resulted primarily from the: $6 million reduction in expense due to the sale of the Oklahoma processing plant and gathering assets in December 2002 $5.1 million reduction in bad debt expenses These decreases were partially offset by increases in various other expenses including $2.9 million in additional costs for the operation of our Texas retail propane business. 34 Table of Contents The decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization for 2003 is primarily due to the $2.8 million depreciation expense reduction associated with owning fewer assets following the sale of a portion of our Oklahoma assets in 2002, partially offset by an increase of approximately $1 million that resulted from our normal 2003 capital expenditure program and the acquisition of our Texas retail propane assets. Additionally, 2002 depreciation expense included a $2.4 million loss taken in the third quarter associated with the sale of a portion of our Oklahoma assets. An additional loss of $1.3 million was taken when the Oklahoma asset sale was closed in December 2002 and is included in other income, net, in 2002. For 2002 compared to 2001, prices decreased resulting in decreased sales revenues and cost of sales which negatively impacted net revenues by $6.1 million. Despite price decreases, natural gas liquids and condensate sales revenues increased, resulting in a positive net revenue impact of $2.3 million due to the additional volumes from third party NGL purchases and sales from NGL pipeline facilities that were leased at the end of 2001. Other increases in net revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 were due to our contractual restructuring efforts and customer elections regarding processing which resulted in an increase in net revenues of $5.9 million. These increases were partially offset by gas volume losses from natural well production declines and the effects of an ice storm in the first quarter of 2002 that caused plant outages across much of Oklahoma. The increase in operating costs in 2002 compared to 2001 is due to the: $4.9 million in additional costs associated with the operation of the NGL pipeline facilities which were leased at the end of 2001 $3.6 million increase primarily in bad debt expense $2.3 million higher employee costs The increase in depreciation expense in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily the result of the $2.4 million loss taken in the third quarter of 2002 relating to the sale of the Oklahoma processing plant and gathering assets described above, and due to our on going capital expenditure program. Risk Management We used derivative instruments during 2003 and 2002 to minimize risk associated with price volatility. The realized financial impact of the derivative transactions is included in our operating income. At December 31, 2003, no hedges were in place. At December 31, 2002, our Gathering and Processing segment had an immaterial portion of its natural gas costs and NGL production hedged. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Transportation and Storage Overview Our Transportation and Storage segment represents our intrastate natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas storage and nonprocessable gas gathering facilities. We own or reserve capacity in five storage facilities in Oklahoma, three in Kansas and three in Texas, with a combined working capacity of approximately 59.6 Bcf, of which 8.0 Bcf is temporarily idle. Our intrastate transmission pipelines operate in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and are regulated by the OCC, KCC, and TRC, respectively. In July 2002, we transferred certain transmission assets in Kansas to our affiliated Kansas distribution company. Historical financial and statistical information has been adjusted to reflect this transfer. Divestitures The following divestitures are described beginning on page 26: sold transmission and gathering pipelines and compression in March 2004 sold Texas transmission assets in October 2003 sold our property rights in Sayre in December 2002 35 Table of Contents Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Transportation and Storage segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (Thousands of Dollars) Financial Results Transportation and gathering revenues $ 102,812 $ 89,349 $ 102,092 Storage revenues 42,086 37,101 37,645 Gas sales and other revenues 16,401 37,784 23,326 Cost of fuel and gas 47,637 46,650 49,626 Net revenues 113,662 117,584 113,437 Operating costs 46,186 46,694 42,357 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 16,694 17,563 17,990 Operating income $ 50,782 $ 53,327 $ 53,090 Other income, net $ 1,495 $ 4,649 $ 2,578 Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ (645 ) $ $ Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Operating and Financial Statistics Volumes transported (MMcf) 449,261 507,972 486,866 Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 15,234 $ 20,554 $ 32,378 Average natural gas price ($/MMBtu)(mid continent region) $ 5.06 $ 3.00 $ 4.16 Operating results The increase in prices for natural gas for 2003 compared to 2002 contributed to increases in: transportation and gathering revenues storage revenues cost of fuel and gas Prices decreased for 2002 compared to 2001 resulting in decreases in the same revenues and expenses. Natural gas prices impact the cost of fuel and gas and the valuation of retained fuel. Accordingly, an increase in price will increase the value placed on the fuel retained as revenue for transportation, gathering and storage services. For the periods shown, we retained more fuel than we consumed in operations and, as a result, when prices increased as in 2003 compared to 2002 the effect was a positive impact on net revenues. Conversely, when prices fell as in 2002 compared to 2001, the effect was a negative impact on net revenues. Periodically, reassessments are made related to the amount of operational inventory needed to operate our storage facilities. In 2002, we determined that some operational inventory at a number of our facilities could be reduced without affecting the operating capacity. As a result of this reassessment, we sold 7.2 Bcf of our operational inventory in 2002 which allowed us to increase our storage capacity available in 2003. The sales of the operational inventory in 2002, with no comparable sales in either 2003 or 2001, offset the effect of prices on net revenues. The positive impact on net revenues for 2002 was $12.7 million. Adjustments related to the reconciliation of third party contractual storage and pipeline imbalance positions in 2002 which impacted net revenues by $8.9 million partially offset the impact of the inventory sales. Additionally, storage revenues increased adding $1.4 million to net revenues for 2003 due to additional working capacity available as the result of improved operating conditions and additional capacity from the sales of gas inventory in 2002. The increase in operating costs in 2002 compared to 2001 is due primarily to the: settlement of legal proceedings increased bad debt expense increased employee costs 36 Table of Contents Other income, net for 2002 included a gain on the sale of storage assets in Oklahoma and transmission assets in Texas, partially offset by lower partnership income in 2002 compared to 2001. Distribution Overview The Distribution segment provides natural gas distribution services in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Operations in Kansas are conducted through KGS, which serves residential, commercial, industrial, transportation and wholesale customers. Operations in Oklahoma are conducted through ONG, which serves residential, commercial, industrial, wholesale and transportation customers, including customers that lease gas pipeline capacity. Operations in Texas are conducted through TGS, which serves residential, commercial, industrial, public authority and transportation customers. Our Distribution segment provides gas service to approximately 71 percent, 86 percent, and 14 percent of the distribution markets of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, respectively. KGS and ONG are subject to regulatory oversight by the KCC and OCC, respectively. TGS is subject to regulatory oversight by the various municipalities that it serves, which have primary jurisdiction in their respective areas. TGS rates in areas adjacent to the various municipalities and appellate matters are subject to regulatory oversight by the TRC. Gas sales to residential and commercial customers are seasonal as a substantial portion of gas is used principally for heating. Accordingly, the volume of gas sales is consistently higher during the heating season (November through March) than in other months of the year. Acquisitions The following acquisitions are described beginning on page 26: acquired the gas distribution system at the United States Armys Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas in August 2003 acquired a pipeline system that extends through the Rio Grande Valley region in Texas in August 2003 acquired Texas gas distribution assets in January 2003 Selected Financial Information The following table sets forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Distribution segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (Thousands of Dollars) Financial Results Gas sales $ 1,640,323 $ 1,140,257 $ 1,434,184 Cost of gas 1,213,811 806,251 1,141,668 Gross margin 426,512 334,006 292,516 Transportation revenues 75,322 59,877 55,206 Other revenues 24,415 20,510 21,578 Net revenues 526,249 414,393 369,300 Operating costs 312,814 243,170 237,657 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 95,654 76,063 70,359 Operating income $ 117,781 $ 95,160 $ 61,284 Other income (expense), net $ (278 ) $ (3,183 ) $ (3,566 ) Operating Results The Distribution segments operating results are primarily impacted by the number of customers, usage and the ability of the division to establish delivery rates that provide an authorized rate of return on the our investment and cost of service. Gas costs are passed through to distribution customers based on the actual cost of gas purchased by the respective distribution division. Because most factors that affect gas sales also affect cost of gas by an equivalent amount, substantial swings can occur from year to year without impacting gross margin. Accordingly, it is more important to look at the factors affecting gross margin. The increase in gross margin in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily due to the: addition of TGS operations implementation of KGS new rate schedule in September 2003 These were partially offset by the $14.2 million reduction in gas costs in the second quarter of 2002 that resulted from the OCC Joint Stipulation. 37 Table of Contents Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization increased in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to the: addition of TGS operations increased bad debt expense resulting from higher gas costs higher employee costs The addition of TGS operations contributed approximately $91.0 million to gross margins, $106.7 million to net revenues and $25.1 million to operating income for 2003. Operating income also increased in 2003 compared to 2002 by approximately $9.8 million as a result of the implementation of KGS new rate schedule. Gross margin for 2002 compared to 2001 increased primarily due to actions taken by the OCC related to the unusually high cost of natural gas incurred during late 2000 and early 2001. These actions, combined with our purchased gas cost recovery mechanism in Oklahoma, delayed the recovery and recognition of a portion of these high gas costs. OCC actions which impacted margins were the: $34.6 million charge to cost of gas in 2001 as the result of the OCCs order limiting ONGs recovery of gas purchase expense $14.2 million reduction in cost of gas in 2002 as the result of the OCC Joint Stipulation Operating costs increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to increased employee costs. Selected Operating Data The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Distribution segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Operating and Financial Statistics Average number of customers 1,990,757 1,439,657 1,436,444 Customers per employee 652 623 611 Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 153,405 $ 115,569 $ 133,470 Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Volumes (MMcf) Gas sales Residential 126,794 104,267 102,976 Commercial 45,013 37,305 40,578 Industrial 3,539 3,387 4,101 Wholesale 29,823 32,082 31,060 Public Authority 2,523 Total volumes sold 207,692 177,041 178,715 PCL, ECT and Transportation 223,771 193,701 136,975 Total volumes delivered 431,463 370,742 315,690 Overall, gas volumes increased primarily as a result of the addition of our TGS customers. Wholesale gas sales in Kansas, also known as as available gas sales, represent gas volumes available under contracts that exceed the needs of our residential and commercial customer base and are available for sale to other parties. Wholesale volumes decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to increased volumes of gas injected into storage. Also impacting the reduction in wholesale volumes was a larger demand in the first quarter of 2003 for Kansas retail customers due to colder weather. Public authority volumes reflect volumes used by state agencies and school districts serviced by TGS. Transportation volumes, which include pipeline capacity leased to others and transportation for end use customers, increased in 2003 primarily due to the addition of transportation customers acquired with TGS. Volumes also increased due to 38 Table of Contents commercial and industrial customers moving to new transportation rates, a marketing effort to add small usage customers, and a reduction in the minimum volume required for transport service in Oklahoma. The residential volumes for 2002 compared to 2001 increased due to a slightly increased number of residential customers as the result of fewer customers being disconnected. Lower commercial and industrial volumes in 2002 compared to 2001 resulted from economic factors causing commercial and industrial customers to reduce their overall consumption. Transportation volumes increased in 2002 after industrial customers returned to normal levels of transport following curtailed production in 2001 that was the result of high gas costs and the assumption of large volume customers in Kansas with the transfer of the MCMC transmission pipeline assets. Volume increases in 2002 were also due to customers moving from commercial and industrial rates to the new transport rates and a marketing effort to add small usage customers. Warmer and dryer weather also increased volumes to irrigation and gas fired electric generation customers. Capital expenditures Our capital expenditure program includes expenditures for extending service to new areas, modifying customer service lines, increasing system capabilities, general replacements and improvements. It is our practice to maintain and periodically upgrade facilities to assure safe, reliable, and efficient operations. In 2003, $31.7 million of our capital expenditures were related to our Texas assets. Our capital expenditure program included $33.5 million, $18.3 million, and $22.4 million for new business development in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Regulatory Initiatives Oklahoma On January 30, 2004, the OCC approved a plan allowing ONG to increase its annual rates $17.7 million in order to recover expenses related to its investment in service lines and cathodic protection, an increased level of uncollectible revenues, and a return on ONGs investment in gas in storage. The Commissions order also approves a modified distribution main extension policy and authorizes ONG to defer homeland security costs ONG expects to incur in the future. The plan authorizes the new rates to be in effect for a maximum of 18 months and categorizes $10.7 million of the annual additional revenues as interim and subject to refund until a final determination at ONGs next general rate case. Approximately $7.0 million annually is considered final and not subject to refund. ONG has committed to filing for a general rate review no later than January 31, 2005. A Joint Stipulation approved by the OCC on May 16, 2002, settled a number of outstanding ONG cases pending before the OCC. The major cases settled were the Commissions inquiry into our gas cost procurement practices during the winter of 2000/2001, an application seeking relief from improper and excessive purchased gas costs, and enforcement action against ONG, our subsidiaries and affiliated companies. In addition, all of the open inquiries related to the annual audits of ONGs fuel adjustment clause for 1996 to 2000 were closed as a result of this Stipulation. The Stipulation has a $33.7 million value to ONG customers that will be realized over a three year period. In July 2002, immediate cash savings were provided to all ONG customers in the form of billing credits totaling approximately $9.1 million. In December 2005, a final billing credit will be made to customers. The minimum amount of this credit is estimated to be approximately $2.8 million. ONG replaced certain gas contracts, which reduced gas costs by approximately $13.8 million, due to avoided reservation fees between April 2003 and October 2005. Additional savings of approximately $8.0 million from the use of storage gas are expected to occur between November 2003 and March 2005. Any expected savings from the use of storage that are not achieved will be added to the final billing credit scheduled to be provided to customers in December 2005. ONGs operating income increased in the second quarter of 2002 by $14.2 million as a result of this settlement. To protect against fuel procurement volatility, ONG exercised provisions contained in a number of its gas supply contracts that allow us to fix the price for a portion of its gas supply. ONG fixed the price of approximately 43 percent and 37 percent of its anticipated 2003/2004 and 2002/2003 winter gas supply deliveries, respectively. Kansas On September 17, 2003, the KCC issued an order approving a $45 million rate increase for our Kansas customers pursuant to the stipulated settlement agreement with KGS. The order settled the rate case filed by KGS in January 2003 and allowed KGS to begin operating under the new rate schedules effective September 22, 2003. After amortization of previously deferred costs, it is estimated that operating income will increase by approximately $29.6 million annually. On June 16, 2003, KGS filed a motion with the KCC to extend the Kansas WeatherProof Bill program for an additional three years. However, as a result of notification that KGS contractor would not be able to provide sufficient support for the program, KGS was allowed by the KCC to withdraw its request on September 12, 2003. Accordingly, the Weatherproof Bill program ended effective December 1, 2003. 39 Table of Contents In July 2002, we completed a transaction to transfer certain transmission assets in Kansas from our Transportation and Storage segment to our Distribution segment. Historical financial and statistical information have been adjusted to reflect these changes. Texas On November 12, 2003, TGS filed an appeal with the TRC based on the denial of proposed rate increases by the cities of Port Neches, Nederland and Groves, Texas. The proposed rate increases were implemented in May 2003, subject to refund, resulting in an annual revenue increase of approximately $0.8 million. The TRC is expected to rule by July 2004. General Certain costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process have been recorded as regulatory assets in accordance with Statement 71. Should recovery cease due to regulatory actions, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria of Statement 71 and, accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. Marketing and Trading Overview Our Marketing and Trading segment purchases, stores, markets, and trades natural gas in the retail sector in its core distribution area and the wholesale sector throughout most of the United States. We have also diversified our marketing and trading portfolio to include power, crude oil and natural gas liquids. We have a strong mid continent region storage and transport position, with transportation capacity of 1.3 Bcf/d. With total cyclical storage capacity of 75 Bcf, withdrawal capability of 2.3 Bcf/d and injection capability of 1.5 Bcf/d spread across 19 different facilities, we have direct access to most regions of the country and flexibility to capture volatility in the energy markets. Because of seasonal demands on natural gas for heating, this volatility is greater in the winter months. We recently extended our marketing and trading operations into leasing storage and pipeline capacity in Canada. We continue to enhance our strategy of focusing on higher margin business, which includes providing reliable service during peak demand periods, through the use of storage and transportation capacity. We continue to enhance our strategy of focusing on higher margin business, which includes providing reliable service during peak demand periods, through the use of storage and transportation capacity. Power We completed construction on a peak electric power generating plant in mid 2001. The 300 megawatt plant is located in Oklahoma adjacent to one of our natural gas storage facilities and is configured to supply electric power during peak demand periods. This plant allows us to capture the spark spread premium, which is the value added by converting natural gas to electricity, during peak demand periods. Because of seasonal demands for electricity for summer cooling, the demands on our power plant are more volatile in the summer months. In October 2003, we signed a tolling arrangement with a third party for its power plant in Big Springs, Texas, which is connected to our gas transmission systems. The agreement, which expires in December 2005, allows us to sell the steam and power generated from the ERCOT. This agreement increases our owned or contracted power capacity from 300 to 512 megawatts. During the first quarter of 2002, our Power segment was combined with our Marketing and Trading segment, eliminating the Power segment. This reflects our strategy of trading around the capacity of our electric generating plant. All segment data has been restated to reflect this change. 40 Table of Contents Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Marketing and Trading segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (Thousands of Dollars) Financial Results Energy trading revenues, net $ 229,782 $ 209,429 $ 101,761 Power sales 91,004 71,749 28,101 Cost of power and fuel 85,378 67,646 21,234 Other revenues 961 948 1,659 Net revenues 236,369 214,480 110,287 Operating costs 33,699 27,674 32,846 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 5,708 5,298 2,611 Operating income $ 196,962 $ 181,508 $ 74,830 Other income (expense), net $ (9,272 ) $ (4,871 ) $ 253 Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ (141,982 ) $ $ Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Operating and Financial Statistics Natural gas volumes (MMcf) 1,011,530 998,537 977,602 Natural gas gross margin ($/Mcf) $ 0.17 $ 0.13 $ 0.10 Power volumes (MMwh) 2,086 2,228 467 Power gross margin ($/Mwh) $ 2.70 $ 1.73 $ 14.69 Physically settled volumes (MMcf) (a) 2,027,853 1,990,371 1,989,186 Capital expenditures (thousands) $ 555 $ 2,340 $ 43,486 (a) This represents the absolute value of gross transaction volumes for both buy and sell energy trading contracts that were physically settled. Operating Results Energy trading revenues include revenues related to marketing and trading of: natural gas wholesale natural gas retail crude oil Included in the trading of natural gas are revenues from reservation fees and basis trades. Basis is the natural gas price differential that exists between a trading locations price relative to the Henry Hub natural gas price. We began actively trading crude oil in this segment in the first quarter of 2002. Net revenues increased 10 percent in 2003 over 2002, although sales volumes increased by only one percent. The increase in net revenues is attributed to the effective utilization of our storage and transport capacity to capture the increased intra month price volatility in the first part of 2003 when daily price volatility was higher compared to the first part of 2002. Included in our net revenues is the change in value of our derivative instruments subject to fair value accounting pursuant to Statement 133, which resulted in a gain of $38.7 million for 2003 (excluding those instruments qualifying for hedge accounting). Net revenues for 2002 and 2001 included mark to market earnings of approximately $42.6 million and $35.3 million respectively, which represented the change in net price risk management assets and liabilities for 2002 and 2001, resulting from the application of mark to market accounting on all energy contracts pursuant to EITF 98 10. Included in 2002 and 2001 mark to market earnings are revenues associated with storage injections. Historically, net revenues were recognized under fair value accounting as physical natural gas inventories were injected into storage during the second and third quarters. With the rescission of EITF 98 10, natural gas inventories carried under storage agreements are no longer carried at fair value, but rather are accounted for on an accrual basis at lower of cost or market with revenues recorded when the gas is sold, typically in the first and fourth quarters. 41 Table of Contents We also benefited by an increase in our natural gas retail operations, which expanded into Wyoming, Nebraska and Texas during 2003. Power related margins increased due to expansion into ERCOT. The increase in our power capacity in ERCOT took place in the fourth quarter of 2003. In the first quarter of 2002, we sold our Enron bankruptcy claim, which increased net revenues by $10.4 million. The sale was subject to normal representations as to the validity, but not collectibility, of the claims and guarantees from Enron. The claims were sold with recourse under certain conditions. Recently, Enron Corporation filed several avoidance actions against many claimants in its bankruptcy proceedings to avoid liability under various guarantees of indebtedness or obligations of Enron North America. If some or all of the Enron Corporation claims are reassigned, we would be required to refund some or all of the sales price of the Enron Corporation claims to the third party and would be responsible for enforcement of the claims in the Enron Corporation bankruptcy proceedings, which might result in an ultimate payment to us of less than our sales price of the Enron Corporation claims. Although it is too early to accurately evaluate the possible effect of this reassignment and the ultimate value of the claims in the Enron Corporate bankruptcy, based on current information available to us we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on us. Operating costs were higher in 2003 compared to 2002 due to our expanded retail operations. The ad valorem tax on our storage inventory was also higher due to rate adjustments. Other expense, net increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to the accrual of the CFTC settlement. Capital expenditures in 2001 consisted primarily of costs related to the construction of the electric generation plant, which was completed in mid 2001. The significant increase in net revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 is attributable to the: use of storage and transport capacity to capture significant intra month and regional price volatility diversification of our marketing and trading portfolio to include crude oil and natural gas liquids sale of the Enron bankruptcy claim in 2002 for $10.4 million, which increased net revenues compared to 2001 when the Enron bankruptcy increased gas cost by $22.9 million Power related margins decreased in 2002 compared to 2001, due to comparatively smaller spark spreads and reduced volatility in the Southwest Power Pool, thereby offsetting part of the increases described above. The decrease in operating cost in 2002 compared to 2001 was due to the $14.5 million impact of the Enron related bad debts in 2001 partially offset by increased employee costs in 2002 related to the expansion of trading, risk management, and support personnel required to operate the expanded base of marketing and trading activities. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Part of our strategy is to grow through acquisitions that strengthen and complement our existing assets. We have relied primarily on operating cash flow, borrowings from commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and issuance of debt and equity in the capital markets for our liquidity and capital resource requirements. We expect to continue to use these sources for liquidity and capital resource needs on both a short and long term basis. We also have no material guarantees of debt or other commitments to unaffiliated parties. During 2001 through 2003, our capital expenditures were financed through operating cash flows and short and long term debt. Capital expenditures for 2003 for continuing operations were $215 million compared to $211 million in 2002. Financing Financing is provided through our commercial paper program, long term debt and, as needed, through a revolving credit facility. Other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuance of equity, issuance of mandatory convertible debt securities, issuance of trust preferred securities by ONEOK Capital Trust I or ONEOK Capital Trust II, asset securitization and sale/leaseback of facilities. In August 2002, we announced that we had completed our tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding 8.44% Senior Notes due 2004 and the 8.32% Senior Notes due 2007 for a total purchase price of approximately $65 million. The total purchase price included a premium of approximately $2.9 million and consent fees of approximately $1.8 million to purchase the notes, which are reflected in interest expense in the income statement. In April 2002, we paid off $240 million of long term floating rate notes that were issued in 2000. 42 Table of Contents Credit Rating Our credit ratings are currently an A (stable outlook) by Standard and Poors and a Baa1 (negative outlook) by Moodys Investor Service. Our credit ratings may be affected by a material change in our financial ratios or a material adverse event affecting our business. The most common criteria for assessment of our credit rating are the debt to capital ratio, pretax and after tax interest debt coverage and liquidity. If our credit ratings were downgraded, the interest rates on our commercial paper would increase, resulting in an increase in our cost to borrow funds. In the event that we are unable to borrow funds under our commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in our business, we have access to an $850 million revolving credit facility, which expires September 20, 2004. We expect the revolving credit facility to be renewed upon expiration. Our energy marketing and trading business relies upon the investment grade rating of our senior unsecured long term debt to satisfy credit support requirements with several counterparties. If our credit ratings declined below investment grade, our ability to participate in energy marketing and trading activity could be significantly limited. Without an investment grade rating, we would be required to fund margin requirements with the counterparties with which we have a Credit Support Annex within our International Swaps and Derivatives Association Agreements with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments. At December 31, 2003, the total notional amount that could require such funding in the event of a credit rating decline to below investment grade is approximately $44.8 million. We have reviewed our commercial paper agreement, trust indentures, building leases, equipment leases, and marketing, trading and risk contracts and no rating triggers were identified. Rating triggers are defined as provisions that would create an automatic default or acceleration of indebtedness based on a change in our credit rating. The revolving credit agreement contains a provision that would cause the cost to borrow funds to increase based on the amount borrowed under this agreement if our credit rating is negatively adjusted. The credit agreement also contains a default provision based on a material adverse change. An adverse rating change is not defined as a default or material adverse change. We currently do not have any funds borrowed under this credit agreement. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price volatility. Significant fluctuations in commodity price in either physical or financial energy contracts may impact our overall liquidity due to the impact the commodity price change has on items such as the cost of NGLs and gas held in storage, recoverability and timing of recovery, increased margin requirements, collectibility of certain energy related receivables and working capital. We believe that our current commercial paper program and debt capacity are adequate to meet our liquidity requirements associated with commodity price volatility. Pension Plan Because the pension fund assets of $579 million in one of our pension plans exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation of $561 million for that plan, we have an asset reported on the balance sheet. Due to the poor performance of the equity market and lower interest rates, the market value of our pension fund assets has decreased and, accordingly, our pension benefit for our pension and supplemental retirement plans will decrease in 2004 from $4.4 million to $1.9 million. Should the value of our pension fund assets fall below our accumulated benefit obligation, we would eliminate the asset and record a minimum pension liability on the balance sheet with the difference flowing through other comprehensive income, net of tax. We believe we have adequate resources to fund our obligations under our pension plan. Stock Buyback Plan During 2001, we put in place a stock buyback plan for up to 10 percent of our capital stock. The program authorized us to make purchases of our common stock on the open market with the timing and terms of purchases and the number of shares purchased to be determined by management based on market conditions and other factors. The purchased shares were to be held in treasury and available for general corporate purposes, funding of stock based compensation plans, and resale at a future date or retirement. This plan expired in 2002. At that time, we had not purchased any stock under the plan. Westar On January 9, 2003, we entered into an agreement with Westar Energy, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Westar Industries, Inc. (collectively, Westar), to repurchase a portion of the shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A) held by Westar and to exchange Westars remaining shares of Series A for newly created shares of our $0.925 Series D Non Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (Series D). The Series A shares were convertible into two shares of our common stock for each share of Series A, reflecting our two for one stock split in 2001, and the Series D shares were convertible into one share of our common stock for each share of Series D. Some of the differences between the Series D and Series A were (a) the Series D had a fixed annual cash dividend of 92.5 cents per share, (b) the Series D was redeemable by us at any time after August 1, 2006, at a redemption price of $20, in the event that the closing price of our common stock exceeded, at any time prior to the date the notice of redemption was given, $25 for 30 consecutive trading days, (c) each share of Series D was convertible into one share of our common stock, and (d) with certain exceptions, Westar could not convert any shares of Series D held by it unless the annual per share dividend for our common stock for the previous year was greater than 92.5 cents per share and such conversion would not have subjected us to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. 43 Table of Contents In connection with that transaction, a new rights agreement, a new shareholder agreement and a new registration rights agreement between us and Westar became effective. Our new shareholder agreement with Westar restricted Westar from selling five percent or more of our outstanding Series D and common stock (assuming conversion of all shares of Series D to be transferred), in a bona fide public underwritten offering, to any one person or to a group. The agreement allowed Westar to sell up to five percent of our outstanding Series D and common stock (assuming conversion of all shares of Series D to be transferred) to any one person or group that did not own more than five percent of our common stock (assuming conversion of all shares of Series D to be transferred). The KCC approved our agreement with Westar on January 17, 2003. On February 5, 2003, we consummated the agreement by purchasing $300 million of our Series A from Westar. We exchanged Westars remaining 10.9 million Series A shares for approximately 21.8 million shares of our newly created Series D. Upon the cash redemption of the Series A shares, the shares were converted to approximately 18.1 million shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of the Series A shares and the prior shareholder agreement with Westar. According, the redemption is reflected as an increase to common treasury stock. The Series D exchanged for the Series A was recorded at fair value and the premium over the previous carrying value of the Series A is reflected as a decrease in retained earnings. We registered all of the shares of our common stock held by Westar, as well as all the shares of our Series D issued to Westar and all of the shares of our common stock that were issuable upon conversion of the Series D. On August 5, 2003, Westar conducted a secondary offering to the public of 9.5 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $19.00 per share, which resulted in gross offering proceeds to Westar of approximately $180.5 million. An over allotment option for an additional 718,000 shares provided Westar with approximately $13.6 million. We did not receive any proceeds from the offering. Since Westar received in excess of $150 million of total proceeds from the offering, we were allowed, under a new transaction agreement related to the offering, to repurchase $50 million, or approximately 2.6 million shares, of our common stock from Westar at the public offering price of $19.00 per share. Our repurchase of those shares occurred immediately following the closing of the Westar offering. Of the shares sold in the Westar public offering, approximately 8.4 million shares represented our common stock issued by conversion of our Series D shares owned by Westar. The remaining shares consisted of approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock owned by Westar. On November 21, 2003, Westar sold all its remaining shares of our stock including approximately 13.4 million shares of Series D, which converted to shares of common stock when sold, and approximately 283,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $19.20 per share resulting in gross proceeds to Westar of approximately $262.7 million. We did not receive any proceeds from the offering. Oklahoma Corporation Commission The OCC staff filed an application on February 1, 2001 to review the gas procurement practices of ONG in acquiring its gas supply for the 2000/2001 heating season to determine if these procurement practices were consistent with least cost procurement practices and whether ONGs decisions resulted in fair, just and reasonable costs to its customers. On November 20, 2001, the OCC entered an order stating that ONG was not allowed to recover the balance in ONGs unrecovered purchased gas cost (UPGC) account related to the unrecovered gas costs from the 2000/2001 winter effective with the first billing cycle for the month following the issuance of a final order. This order halted ONGs recovery process effective December 1, 2001. On December 12, 2001, the OCC approved a request to stay the order and allowed ONG to begin collecting unrecovered gas costs, subject to refund if ONG ultimately lost the case. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of $34.6 million as a result of this OCC order. In April 2002, we, along with the staff of the Public Utility Division and the Consumer Services Division of the OCC, the Oklahoma Attorney General, and other stipulating parties filed a joint stipulation agreement proposing settlement of this and other issues. A hearing with the OCC was held in May 2002 and an order approving the settlement was issued at that time. As a result, we recorded a $14.2 million recovery in the second quarter of 2002 and have the potential of an additional $8.0 million recovery before December 2005 depending upon the potential value that could be generated by gas storage savings. Cash Flow Analysis Operating Cash Flows Operating cash flows decreased by $808.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same period in 2002, despite a significant increase in income from continuing operations. The primary impact on operating cash flows came from changes in working capital, much of which relates to increases in gas in storage. Weather can have a significant effect on gas inventories. November and December are typically withdrawal months providing a source of cash; however, warmer weather in November 2003 and much of December 2003 resulted in a higher level of gas remaining in storage than would normally be expected at that time of the year. The increased gas in storage, including amounts previously classified as price risk management assets, resulted in a reduction in operating cash flows of $218.1 million. 44 Table of Contents The impact of higher commodity prices in 2003 on accounts receivables and accounts payables also negatively impacted operating cash flows. There is typically a lag between when payment is made for gas purchased for our distribution customers and when the customers are billed. This is due to the cycle billing where distribution customers are billed throughout the month. Under level prices, this lag would have no impact on cash flows from year to year, but with increased prices, as seen in 2003, this lag resulted in a negative impact on cash flows. Deposits, or additional margin requirements, by our Marketing and Trading segment, changes in deferred income taxes, and changes in other assets and liabilities also contributed to the decrease in operating cash flows. Changes in other assets and liabilities reflect expenditures or recognition of liabilities for insurance costs, salaries, taxes other than income, and other similar items. Period to period fluctuations in these accounts reflect changes in the timing of payments or recognition of liabilities and are not directly impacted by seasonal factors. We had a significant increase in earnings in 2002 compared to 2001. In addition, the changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable are primarily due to an increase in net energy trading revenues. Net energy trading revenues increased due to our use of storage and transport capacity to capture significant intra month and regional price volatility. In 2002, we also diversified our marketing and trading portfolio to include crude oil and natural gas liquids. These increases were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable due to lower natural gas prices in 2002. In addition, we had a full year of the electric generating plant operations in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in deferred income taxes is primarily due to increased mark to market income in 2002 compared to 2001 and additional tax depreciation taken in 2002. In 2001, the changes in cash flows provided by operating activities primarily reflect changes in working capital accounts, deferred income taxes, and price risk management assets and liabilities. The increase in deferred income taxes is primarily due to accelerated depreciation in 2001. The increase in price risk management assets and liabilities is primarily due to the Marketing and Trading segments gas in storage, which was included in price risk management assets on the consolidated balance sheet in 2001. Cash flow from operating activities was positively impacted in 2001 due to the reduction of accounts receivable, which was partially offset by increased cash used for payment of accounts payable and gas in storage as well as reduced recovery of unrecovered purchased gas costs. Investing Cash Flows Acquisitions in 2003 represent the cash purchase of our Texas assets and the purchase of gas and oil properties and related flow lines from a partnership owned by Wagner & Brown, Ltd. Cash provided by investing activities of the discontinued component represents the sale of natural gas and oil producing properties for a cash sales price of $294 million, including adjustments, of which $15 million was received in 2002. Proceeds from the sale of property in 2002 include approximately $92 million related to the sale of a portion of our midstream natural gas assets to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation, a private, independent oil and gas company. Proceeds from the sale of equity investments represent the sale of our interest in MHR in 2002. Capital expenditures in 2001 include approximately $42.3 million for the construction of the electric generating plant. In 2001, we were reimbursed by an unaffiliated company for approximately $14 million of the costs incurred to construct a pipeline in the Transportation and Storage segment. Due to regulatory treatment, this amount is recorded as a deferred credit in the balance sheet and amortized to income. We also received approximately $7.9 million related to the sale of assets by our Production segment in 2001. Acquisitions in 2001 include $14.5 million of purchase price adjustments, which resulted in an increase to goodwill, relating to acquisitions made in the previous year. Financing Cash Flows The following table sets forth our capitalization structure for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 Long tem debt 60 % 53 % Equity 40 % 47 % Debt (including Notes payable) 67 % 57 % Equity 33 % 43 % In January 2003, we issued common stock and equity units, which were partially offset by the payment of notes payable and the repurchase of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from Westar in February 2003. In August 2003, we repurchased $50 million or approximately 2.6 million shares of our common stock from Westar. At December 31, 2003, $1.9 billion of 45 Table of Contents long term debt, including current maturities, was outstanding. As of that date, we could have issued $1.0 billion of additional long term debt under the most restrictive provisions contained in our various borrowing agreements. Both Standard and Poors (S&P) and Moodys Investment Services consider the equity units we issued in January 2003 to be part equity and part debt. For purposes of computing capitalization ratios, these rating agencies adjust the capitalization structure. S&P considers the equity units to be equal amounts of debt and equity for the first three years, with the effect being to increase shareholders equity by the same amount as long term debt, which would result in a capitalization structure of 47 percent equity and 53 percent long term debt at December 31, 2003. Moodys Investment Services considers 25 percent of the equity units to be long term debt and 75 percent to be shareholders equity, which would result in a capitalization structure of 49 percent equity and 51 percent long term debt at December 31, 2003. Our $850 million revolving credit facility was renewed September 22, 2003. The new facility expires in September 2004 and includes a term out option, which allows us to convert any outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement into a 364 day term note at the expiration of the credit agreement. This facility is primarily used to support our commercial paper program. At December 31, 2003, we had approximately $600 million of commercial paper outstanding and approximately $12 million in temporary investments. We did not have any funds outstanding under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In April 2001, we issued a $400 million, ten year, fixed rate note to refinance short term debt. On July 18, 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 for the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock and debt securities in one or more offerings with an aggregate offering price of up to $500 million. On December 20, 2002, we amended the shelf registration statement on Form S 3 to increase the aggregate offering price of securities to be issued under the shelf registration statement to $1.0 billion and to add some additional securities, including preferred stock, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units. During the first quarter of 2003, we conducted public offerings of our common stock and equity units under that shelf registration statement. In connection with these offerings, we issued a total of 13.8 million shares of common stock at the public offering price of $17.19 per share, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $16.524 per share, or $228 million. In addition, we issued a total of 16.1 million equity units at the public offering price of $25 per unit, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $24.25 per share, or $390.4 million. Each equity unit consists of a stock purchase contract for the purchase of shares of our common stock and, initially, a senior note due February 16, 2008, issued pursuant to our existing Indenture with SunTrust Bank, as trustee. The equity units carry a total annual coupon rate of 8.5 percent (4.0 percent annual face amount of the senior notes plus 4.5 percent annual contract adjustment payments). The interest expense associated with the 4.0 percent senior notes will be recognized in the income statement on an accrual basis over the term of the senior notes. The present value of the contract adjustment payments was accrued as a liability with a charge to equity at the time of the transactions. Accordingly, there will be no impact on earnings in future periods as this liability is paid, except for the interest recognized as a result of discounting the liability to its present value at the time of the transaction. This interest expense will be approximately $3.5 million over three years. The present value of the contract adjustment payments is accounted for as equity and reduces paid in capital. The number of shares that we will issue for each stock purchase contract issued as part of the equity units will be determined based on our average closing price over the 20 trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to February 16, 2006. If this average closing price: equals or exceeds $20.63, we will issue 1.2119 shares of our common stock for each purchase contract or unit; equals or is less than $17.19, we will issue 1.4543 shares of our common stock for each purchase contract or unit; is less than $20.63 but greater than $17.19, we will determine the number of shares of our common stock to be issued by multiplying the number of purchase contracts or units by the ratio of $25 divided by the average closing price. On April 4, 2003, we filed an amendment to a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 for our issuance and sale of common stock, preferred stock, purchase contracts, purchase contract units and debt securities, and the issuance and sale by ONEOK Capital Trust I and ONEOK Capital Trust II of trust preferred securities, in one or more offerings with an aggregate offering price of up to $1.0 billion. Also, on April 4, 2003, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 to register for resale by Westar all of the shares of our common stock held by Westar, as well as all the shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock issued to Westar and all of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. Both of these registration statements have been declared effective by the SEC. 46 Table of Contents During the first quarter of 2004, we conducted a public offering of our common stock. In connection with this offering, we sold a total of 6.9 million shares of our common stock to the underwriter at a price of $21.93 per share, resulting in proceeds to us, before expenses, of $151.3 million. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table sets forth our contractual obligations to make future payments under our current debt agreements, operating lease agreements and fixed price contracts. For further discussion of the debt and operating lease agreements, see Notes K and M, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K.

Purchase commitments exclude commodity purchase contracts. The Distribution segment is party to fixed price transportation contracts. However, the costs associated with these contracts are recovered through rates as allowed by the applicable regulatory agency and are excluded from the table above. Trading Activities The following table sets forth the fair value component of the price risk management assets and liabilities, which result from our Marketing and Trading segments energy trading portfolio. Fair Value Component of Price Risk Management Assets and Liabilities (Thousands of Dollars) Net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002 $ 102,167 Rescission of EITF 98 10, resulting in the removal of energy related contracts from fair value accounting (230,997 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period 65,621 Fair value of new contracts when entered into during the period 36,932 Other changes in fair value 7,923 Net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2003 $ (18,354 ) The net fair value of contracts outstanding includes the effect of settled energy contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of market movements on the fair value of price risk management assets and liabilities attributable to our Marketing and Trading segments activities. Fair value estimates consider the market in which the transactions are executed. The market in which exchange traded and over the counter transactions are executed is a factor in determining fair value. We utilize third party references for pricing points from NYMEX and third party over the counter brokers to establish the commodity pricing and volatility curves. We believe the reported transactions from these sources are the most reflective of current market prices. Fair values are subject to change based on valuation factors. The estimate of fair value includes an adjustment for the liquidation of the position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions. The fair value estimate also considers the risk of nonperformance based on credit considerations of the counterparty. The net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2003, includes energy commodity contracts considered derivatives under Statement 133, including forwards, futures, swaps and options. 47 Table of Contents The net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002, includes energy and energy related trading contracts accounted for under the mark to market accounting requirements of EITF 98 10, including forwards, futures, swaps, options and energy transportation and storage contracts. The net fair value of contracts also includes the fair value component of gas in storage. The following table sets forth our Marketing and Trading segments maturity of energy trading contracts based on the heating season from April through March. This maturity schedule is consistent with our Marketing and Trading segments business strategy.

These fair values are reflected as a component of assets and liabilities from price risk management activities in the consolidated balance sheets. (2) Values are derived from energy market price quotes from national commodity trading exchanges that primarily trade future and option commodity contracts. (3) Values are obtained through energy commodity brokers or electronic trading platforms, whose primary service is to match willing buyers and sellers of energy commodities. Because of the large energy broker network, energy price information by location is readily available. (4) Values derived in this category utilize market price information from the other two categories, as well as other assumptions for liquidity and credit. The following table sets forth our Marketing and Trading segments financial and commodity risk from fixed price transactions at December 31, 2003.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Statement 132R In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106 (Statement 132R). Statement 132R requires additional disclosures about assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. Statement 132R is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, except for the disclosure of estimated future benefit payments which will be effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we adopted all additional 48 Table of Contents disclosures required for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. We will adopt the disclosure of estimated future benefit payments in 2004. Other Related Party Transactions KGS has a shared service agreement with Westar, who was the holder of our preferred stock. The shared services include call center backup, meter readings, customer billing operations and customer service. In 2003, KGS made a net payment of approximately $5.1 million to Westar related to this shared service agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Westar sold, in a series of transactions, all of the shares of our common and preferred stock it held, and Westar no longer holds any shares of our common or preferred stock. Southwest Gas Corporation Two substantially identical derivative actions, which were consolidated, were filed by shareholders against members of the board of directors and certain officers of the Company alleging violation of their fiduciary duties to the Company by causing or allowing the Company to engage in certain fraudulent and improper schemes related to the planned acquisition of Southwest Gas Corporation and waste of corporate assets. The consolidated derivative action has been settled at no significant cost to the Company. The trial court entered a final judgment on June 24, 2003, approving the settlement by the parties after notice had been given to shareholders. Information related to litigation arising out of the termination of our effort to acquire Southwest Gas Corporation is presented in Note M in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Environmental We are subject to multiple environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid wastes and hazardous material and substance management. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines, penalties and or interruptions in our operations that could be material to our results of operations. If an accidental leak or spill of hazardous materials occurs from our lines or facilities, in the process of transporting natural gas, or at any facilities that we own, operate or otherwise use, we could be held jointly and severally liable for all resulting liabilities, including investigation and clean up costs, which could materially affect our results, operations and cash flow. In addition, emission controls required under the Federal Clean Air Act and other similar federal and state laws could require unexpected capital expenditures at our facilities. We cannot assure you that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We own or retain legal responsibility for the environmental conditions at 12 former manufactured gas sites in Kansas. These sites contain potentially harmful materials that are subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. A consent agreement with the KDHE presently governs all work at these sites. The terms of the consent agreement allow us to investigate these sites and set remediation activities based upon the results of the investigations and risk analysis. We have commenced active remediation on three sites with regulatory closure achieved at two of these locations, and have begun assessment at the remaining sites. The site situations are not common and we have no previous experience with similar remediation efforts. We have not completed a comprehensive study of the remaining nine sites and therefore cannot accurately estimate individual or aggregate costs to satisfy our remedial obligations. Our preliminary review of similar cleanup efforts at former manufactured gas sites reveals that costs can range from $100,000 to $10 million per site. These estimates do not give effect to potential insurance recoveries, recoveries through rates or from unaffiliated parties, to which we may be entitled. At this time, we have not recorded any amounts for potential insurance recoveries or recoveries from unaffiliated parties, and we are not recovering any environmental amounts in rates. Total costs to remediate the two sites, which have achieved regulatory closure, totaled approximately $800,000. Total remedial costs for each of the remaining sites are expected to exceed $400,000 per site, but there is no assurance that costs to investigate and remediate the remaining sites will not be significantly higher. As more information related to the site investigations and remediation activities becomes available, and to the extent such amounts are expected to exceed our current estimates, additional expenses could be recorded. Such amounts could be material to our results of operations and cash flows depending on the remediation done and number of years over which the remediation is completed. Our expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation have not been significant in relation to the results of operations and there have been no material effects upon earnings or our competitive position during 2003 related to compliance with environmental regulations. 49 Table of Contents Yaggy Facility In January 2001, the Yaggy gas storage facilitys operating parameters were changed as mandated by the KDHE following natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers in or near Hutchison, Kansas. In July 2002, the KDHE issued an administrative order that assessed an $180,000 civil penalty against us, based on alleged violations of several KDHE regulations. A status conference was held on June 27, 2003 regarding progress toward reaching an agreed upon consent order. The matter was continued pending further settlement negotiations. We believe there are no adverse long term environmental effects. Two class action lawsuits have been filed against us in connection with the natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers that occurred at, and in the vicinity of, the Yaggy facility. These class action lawsuits claim that the explosions were caused by the releases of natural gas from our operations. In addition to the two pending class action matters, sixteen additional lawsuits have been filed against us or our subsidiaries seeking recovery for various claims related to the Yaggy incident, including property damage, personal injury, loss of business and, in some instances, punitive damage. In February 2003, a jury awarded the plaintiffs in one lawsuit $1.7 million in actual damages. The jury found that 50 percent of the liability related to the Company and 50 percent of the liability related to one of the Companys subsidiaries. The jury also awarded punitive damages against a subsidiary of the Company. A hearing has been set for April 2004 to determine the amount of the punitive damages. Although no assurances can be given, we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. We are vigorously defending all claims in these cases and believe that our insurance coverage will provide coverage for any material liability associated with these cases. U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission On January 9, 2003, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) requesting information regarding certain trading by energy and power marketing firms and information provided by us to energy industry publications in connection with the CFTCs investigation of trading and trade reporting practices of power and natural gas trading companies. We ceased providing such information to energy industry publications in 2002. We cooperated fully with the CFTC, producing documents and other material in response to specific requests relating to the reporting of natural gas trading information to energy industry publications, conducting an internal review with regard to our practice in voluntarily reporting information to trade publications, and providing reports on our internal review to the CFTC. In January 2004, we announced a settlement with the CFTC relating to the investigation, whereby we agreed, among other things, to pay a civil monetary penalty of $3.0 million. This charge is recorded in earnings for the Marketing and Trading segment for the year ended December 31, 2003. We neither admitted nor denied the findings in the CFTC settlement order. We do not believe inaccurate trade reporting to the energy industry publications affected the financial accounting treatment of any transactions recorded in the financial statements. On February 4, 2004, we received notice that we and our wholly owned subsidiary, ONEOK Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P., have been named as two of the defendants in a class action lawsuit filed in the United Sates District Court for the Southern District of New York brought on behalf of persons who bought and sold natural gas futures and options contacts on the New York Mercantile Exchange during the years 2000 through 2002. See Part 1, Item 3 Legal Proceedings in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Although we agreed to the civil monetary penalty with the CFTC, it cannot guarantee other additional legal proceedings, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other regulatory action related to this issue will not arise. Accordingly, the impact of any further action on the financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted. Labor Negotiations On July 28, 2003, KGS and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers labor union entered into a three year bargaining agreement expiring June 30, 2006. Approximately 351 of our KGS employees are members of this labor union, comprising approximately 30 percent of our KGS workforce. The parties agreed to a two percent wage increase effective July 1, 2004 and an additional two percent wage increase effective July 1, 2005. On September 12, 2003, KGS completed negotiations with the remaining three Kansas labor unions to replace collective bargaining agreements that expired on July 31, 2003. Approximately 476 KGS employees are members of those three labor unions, comprising approximately 41 percent of our KGS workforce. The parties agreed to extend the existing agreements for one year with a two percent increase effective retroactively to August 1, 2003. Currently, we have no ongoing labor negotiations and there are no other unions representing our employees.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Commodity Price Risk Non Regulated Businesses, Including Marketing and Trading We are exposed to market risk and the impact of market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and power prices. Market risk refers to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in commodity energy prices. Our primary exposure arises from fixed price purchase or sale agreements that extend for periods of up to six years, gas in storage utilized by the marketing and trading operation, NGLs in storage utilized by the NGL marketing operation, the difference in price between natural gas and NGL prices with respect to our keep whole processing agreements, and anticipated sales of natural gas and oil production. To a lesser extent, we are exposed to the risk of changing prices or the cost of intervening transportation resulting from purchasing gas at one location and selling it at another (referred to as basis risk). To minimize the risk from market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, we use commodity derivative instruments such as futures contracts, swaps and options to manage market risk of existing or anticipated purchase and sale agreements, existing physical gas in storage, and basis risk. We adhere to policies and procedures that limit our exposure to market risk from open positions and that monitor our market risk exposure. For a detail of the Marketing and Trading segments maturity of energy trading contracts based on heating injection and withdrawal periods from April through March and the related models and assumptions, refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. For further discussion of trading activities, see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Also, see Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Regulated Businesses KGS uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of anticipated gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect KGS customers from upward volatility in natural gas market prices. At December 31, 2003, KGS had derivative instruments in place to hedge the cost of purchases for 13.5 Bcf of gas, representing part of KGS gas purchase requirements for the 2003/2004 winter heating months based on normal weather conditions. Gains or losses associated with the KGS hedges are included in and recoverable through the monthly PGA. From time to time, TGS uses derivative instruments to mitigate the volatility of the cost of gas to protect its customers in the city of El Paso. At December 31, 2003, TGS had no derivative instruments in place to hedge the cost of purchases of gas. Gains or losses associated with the derivative instruments would be included in and recoverable through the monthly purchased gas adjustment. Value at Risk We measure market risk in the trading, price risk management, and non trading portfolios of our non regulated businesses using a value at risk (VAR) methodology, which estimates the expected maximum loss of the portfolio over a specified time horizon within a given confidence interval. Our VAR calculations are based on the Monte Carlo approach, which we began using in the second quarter of 2002. Prior to that time, we used the variance covariance approach. The quantification of market risk using VAR provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance, to determine risk targets and set position limits. The use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions, including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation. Inputs to the calculation include prices, positions, instrument valuations and the variance covariance matrix. Historical data is used to estimate our VAR with more weight given to recent data, which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements. We rely on VAR to determine the potential reduction in the trading and price risk management portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period. While management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable, no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating VAR. Different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different VAR estimates. Our VAR exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized for our non regulated businesses trading, price risk management, and non trading portfolios of derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and gas in storage due to adverse market movements. A one day time horizon and a 95 percent confidence level were used in our VAR data. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the VAR calculation based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices, operating exposures and timing thereof, and the changes in our derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and gas in storage. VAR information should be evaluated in light of these assumptions and the methodologys other limitations. 52 Table of Contents The potential impact on our future earnings, as measured by the VAR, was $11.0 million and $3.2 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The following table details the average, high and low VAR calculations. Years Ended December 31, Value at Risk 2003 2002 (Millions of Dollars) Average $ 3.9 $ 5.0 High $ 17.1 $ 17.8 Low $ 0.5 $ 1.2 The variations in the VAR data are reflective of market volatility and changes in the portfolio during the year. Risk Policy and Oversight We control the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. Our board of directors affirms the risk limit parameters, with our audit committee having oversight responsibilities for the policies. A risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price, credit and interest rate risk management, and marketing and trading activities. The committee also proposes risk metrics including VAR and position loss limits. We have a corporate risk control organization led by our Senior Vice President of Financial Services and the Vice President of Audit Services and Risk Control, who are assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies, procedures and limits as well as evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions. Key risk control activities include credit review and approval, credit and performance risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics. To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably. As a result, we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position. Interest Rate Risk We are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the normal course of business. We manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates. At December 31, 2003, the interest rate on 59.4 percent of our debt was fixed, after considering the effect of interest rate swaps. Currently, $740 million of fixed rate debt is swapped to floating. The floating rate debt is based on both three and six month London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). At December 31, 2003, $500.0 million of the $740 million had the interest rate locked through the first quarter of 2005. Based on the current LIBOR strip and the locks in place, the weighted average rate on the $740 million of debt will be reduced from 7.01 percent to 3.15 percent. This will result in an estimated savings of $28.6 million during 2004. The swaps resulted in approximately $20.6 million in savings in 2002 and $24.4 million in savings during 2003. At December 31, 2003, price risk management assets include $55.8 million to recognize the fair value of our derivatives that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Long term debt includes approximately $55.9 million to recognize the change in fair value of the related hedged liability. Interest expense increased approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to recognize the ineffectiveness of these hedges. At December 31, 2003, a 100 basis point move in the annual interest rate on all of our outstanding long term debt would change our annual interest expense by $2.4 million before taxes. This amount is limited based on the LIBOR locks that we have in place through the first quarter of 2005. If these locks were not in place, a 100 basis point change in the interest rates would affect our annual interest expense by $7.4 million before taxes. This 100 basis point change assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. If interest rates changed significantly, we would take actions to manage our exposure to the change. Since a specific action and the possible effects are uncertain, no change has been assumed. 53 Table of Contents
