ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION Executive Summary We are a diversified energy company with nearly a century of experience in the natural gas business. Since 1906, we have grown from an Oklahoma intrastate natural gas pipeline business to an integrated natural gas company with operations throughout the mid continent area of the United States and, more recently, in Canada. The following discussion highlights some of our achievements and significant issues affecting us this past year. You should read the relevant sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis and the Financial Statements for a complete explanation of the following items. In 2004, we saw our income from continuing operations increase to $242.2 million from $214.3 million in 2003, a 13 percent increase. Operating income increased to $490.0 million in 2004 from $446.1 million in 2003, and cash flow from operations increased to $204.8 million in 2004 from $0.7 million in 2003. Our dividend was increased each quarter during 2004, to a current annual dividend of $1.00 per share of common stock. This follows two increases in our dividend during 2003. EPS is one of the key indicators that we use to evaluate our success. Other key indicators that we use are shareholder appreciation as compared to our peer companies and return on invested capital. Our business strategy is focused on the maximization of shareholder value by integrating our natural gas business operations. We expect to continue evaluating and assessing acquisition opportunities to further complement our existing asset base. We also, from time to time, sell assets when deemed less strategic or as other conditions warrant. 25 Table of Contents The contribution to our earnings from the gas and oil reserves we acquired in December 2003 was primarily responsible for the $31.7 million increase in operating income in our Production segment. In 2004, our gathering and processing segment increased operating income by $68.3 million over 2003, or an increase of 109 percent. This followed an 89 percent increase in 2003 over 2002. The third and fourth quarter of 2004 had the most favorable pricing environment for natural gas and NGL products as any period in the last five years. In November 2004, we closed the purchase of Northern Plains and became the holder of the majority of the general partnership interest in the limited partnership. We will operate more than $2.5 billion of assets in a mix of mostly natural gas assets, including interstate pipelines, gathering pipelines and processing plants located in an area stretching from the Canadian Border and the Rockies to the upper Midwest. We filed for $99.4 million in rate relief in Oklahoma on January 28, 2005, of which $38.5 million would be paid in additional income taxes. This amount includes $10.7 million of the interim rate relief granted in January 2004. We have not had an increase to our base rates in Oklahoma since 1995. Under Oklahoma state law, the OCC has 180 days to conduct a review and issue an order in response to our application. This means that any approved rate relief would be in effect prior to the 2005/2006 heating season. The September 2003 rate increase in Kansas was in effect for the entire 2004 year. This provided $16.2 million in additional operating income, as compared to 2003, which included the rate increase for a portion of the year. A reorganization in the Energy Services segment at July 1, 2004, changed the way we do business and present revenues in that segment. As a result of separating the management and operations of our physical marketing, retail marketing and financial trading activities, we began accounting separately for the different types of revenue earned from these activities. Significant Acquisitions and Divestitures In November 2004, we acquired Northern Plains, which owns 82.5 percent of the general partnership interest and 500,000 limited partnership units, together representing a 2.73 percent ownership interest, in Northern Border Partners, from CCE Holdings, LLC for $175 million. Income derived from this investment is included in other income in our Other segment. In March 2004, we sold certain natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines and compression facilities for approximately $13 million and recorded a pre tax gain of $6.9 million, which is included in other income in our Transportation and Storage segment. In December 2003, we acquired approximately $240 million of Texas gas and oil properties and related flow lines from a partnership owned by Wagner & Brown, Ltd. of Midland, Texas. The results of operations for these assets have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. The acquisition included approximately 318 wells, 271 of which we operate, and 177.2 Bcfe of estimated proved gas and oil reserves as of the September 1, 2003 effective date, with additional probable and possible reserve potential. Net production from these properties is approximately 26,000 Mcfe per day. In December 2003, we acquired NGL storage and pipeline facilities located in Conway, Kansas for approximately $13.7 million from ChevronTexaco. In the prior two years, we had leased and operated these facilities. In January 2003, we sold approximately 70 percent of the natural gas and oil producing properties of our Production segment for a cash sales price of $294 million, including adjustments. The properties sold were in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. The effective date of the sale was November 30, 2002. The sale included approximately 1,900 wells, 482 of which we operated. We recorded a pretax gain of approximately $61.2 million in 2003 related to this sale. The statistical and financial information related to the properties sold is reflected as a discontinued component in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All periods presented have been restated to reflect the discontinued component. In January 2003, we acquired the Texas gas distribution business and other Texas assets from Southern Union. The results of operations for these assets have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. We paid approximately $436.6 million for these assets, including $16.6 million in working capital adjustments. The primary assets acquired were gas distribution operations that currently serve approximately 557,000 customers in cities located throughout Texas, including the major cities of El Paso and Austin, as well as the cities of Port Arthur, Galveston, Brownsville and others. Over 90 percent of the customers are residential. The other assets acquired include a 125 mile natural gas transmission system, as well as other energy related domestic assets involved in gas marketing, retail sales of propane and distribution of propane. The purchase also included natural gas distribution investments in Mexico. The assets relating to the 26 Table of Contents propane distribution operations were sold in May and July 2004 and the natural gas distribution investments in Mexico were sold in May 2004. Texas Gas Service operated these assets. In December 2002, we sold a portion of our midstream natural gas assets for a cash sales price of approximately $92 million to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation, a private, independent oil and gas company. We recorded a loss of approximately $3.7 million in 2002 related to this sale. The assets that were sold are located in north central Oklahoma and include three natural gas processing plants and related gathering systems and our interest in a fourth natural gas processing plant. Regulatory Several regulatory initiatives positively impacted the earnings and future earnings potential for the Distribution segment. These are discussed beginning on pages 43 44. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We lease various buildings, facilities and equipment, which are accounted for as operating leases. We lease vehicles, which are accounted for as operating leases for financial purposes and capital leases for tax purposes. For a summary of scheduled future payments, see Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments on page 51. Other On January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (Statement 148) and began expensing the fair value of all stock options beginning with options granted on or after January 1, 2003 under the prospective method allowed by Statement 148. See Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for disclosure of our pro forma net income and EPS information had we applied the fair value provisions for options granted for the year ended December 31, 2002. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment (Statement 123R). Statement 123R requires companies to expense the fair value of share based payments. In addition, there are also changes related to the share based payment expense calculation. Statement 123R is effective for the interim period beginning after June 15, 2005. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting Statement 123R, but we do not believe it will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as we have been expensing share based payments since the adoption of Statement 148 on January 1, 2003. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and included in this report on Form 10 K. Certain amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosure must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. Therefore, the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. The following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies, which are defined as those policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring managements most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters. We have discussed the development of and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. Derivatives and Risk Management Activities We engage in wholesale energy marketing, retail marketing, trading, and risk management activities. We account for derivative instruments utilized in connection with these activities and services under the fair value basis of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (Statement 133), as amended. Under Statement 133, entities are required to record derivative instruments at fair value. The fair value of derivative instruments is determined by commodity exchange prices, over the counter quotes, volatility, time value, counterparty credit 27 Table of Contents and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions. Refer to the table on page 52 for amounts in our portfolio at December 31, 2004 that were determined by prices actively quoted, prices provided by other external sources, and prices derived from other sources. The majority of our portfolios fair values are based on actual market prices. Transactions are also executed in markets for which market prices may exist but the market may be relatively inactive, thereby resulting in limited price transparency that requires managements subjectivity in estimating fair values. Market value changes result in a change in the fair value of our derivative instruments. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the reason for holding it. If the derivative instrument does not qualify or is not designated as part of a hedging relationship, we account for changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings are they occur. Commodity price volatility may have a significant impact on the gain or loss in any given period. For more information on fair value sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. To minimize the risk of fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices, we periodically enter into futures transactions and swaps in order to hedge anticipated sales and purchases of natural gas and crude oil production, fuel requirements and NGL inventories. Interest rate swaps are also used to manage interest rate risk. Under certain conditions, we designate these derivative instruments as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values or cash flows. For hedges of exposure to changes in fair value, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. For hedges of exposure to changes in cash flow, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness of designated hedges is reported in earnings. Many of our purchase and sale agreements that otherwise would be required to follow derivative accounting qualify as normal purchases and normal sales under Statement 133 and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment. Energy related contracts that are not derivatives pursuant to Statement 133 are no longer carried at fair value, but are accounted for on an accrual basis as executory contracts. Changes to the accounting for existing contracts as a result of the rescission of EITF Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF 98 10) were reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. This resulted in a cumulative effect loss, net of tax, of $141.8 million. Impairment of Goodwill and Long Lived Assets We assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (Statement 142). An initial assessment is made by comparing the fair value of the operations with goodwill, as determined in accordance with Statement 142, to the book value of each reporting unit. If the fair value is less than the book value, an impairment is indicated and we must perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment. In the second test, we calculate the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the operations with goodwill from the fair value determined in step one of the assessment. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds this calculated implied fair value of the goodwill, we will record an impairment charge. At December 31, 2004, we had $225.2 million of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. We assess our long lived assets for impairment based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (Statement 144). A long lived asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may exceed its fair value. Fair values are based on the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. Examples of long lived asset impairment indicators include: a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator that would exclude allowable costs from the rate making process, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset or asset group, a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group, and 28 Table of Contents a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. We do not currently anticipate any goodwill or asset impairments to occur within the next year. Factors that would most likely impact the recoverability of our long term assets would include a significant and long term decline in commodity prices, partial or complete deregulation of our regulated business, a significant decrease in the rate of return for a regulated business, a major accident affecting the use of an asset or a decrease in the supply of natural gas. We do not foresee any of these events occurring in the near term, but if such events were to occur over the long term, the impact could be significant to our financial condition and results of operations. Pension and Postretirement Employee Benefits We have a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all full time employees and a postretirement employee benefits plan covering most employees. Nonbargaining unit employees hired after December 31, 2004 are not eligible for our defined benefit pension plan; however, they are covered by a profit sharing plan. Nonbargaining unit employees retiring between the ages of 50 and 55 who elect postretirement medical coverage, all nonbargaining unit employees hired on or after January 1, 1999, employees who are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers hired after June 30, 2003 and gas union employees hired after July 1, 2004 who elect postretirement medical coverage pay 100 percent of the retiree premium for participation in the plan. Additionally, any employees who came to us through various acquisitions may be further limited in their eligibility to participate or receive any contributions from us for postretirement medical benefits. Our actuarial consultant calculates the expense and liability related to these plans and uses statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, age and employment periods. In determining the projected benefit obligations and the costs, assumptions can change from period to period and result in material changes in the costs and liabilities we recognize. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for our health care plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects. One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease (Thousands of dollars) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 2,993 $ (2,396 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 27,713 $ (22,856 ) During 2004, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $0.9 million related to our defined benefit pension plans and $25.0 million related to postretirement benefits. We estimate that in 2005 we will record net periodic benefit costs of $12.5 million related to our defined benefit pension plan and $30.1 million related to postretirement benefits. These increases primarily reflect our acquisition of Northern Plains, amendments in benefits payable under our gas union contracts and a change in our assumed discount rate. We will be reimbursed for approximately $2.3 million of this increase by Northern Border Partners for defined benefit pension plan expenses that we incur for them. In determining our estimated expenses for 2005, our actuarial consultant assumed an 8.75 percent expected return on plan assets and a discount rate of 6.00 percent. A decrease in our expected return on plan assets to 8.50 percent would increase our 2005 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $1.5 million for our defined benefit pension plan and would not have a significant impact on our postretirement benefit plan. An increase in our assumed discount rate to 6.50 percent would decrease our 2005 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $4.5 million for our defined benefit pension plan and $1.9 million for our postretirement benefit plan. See Note K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for additional information. Contingencies Our accounting for contingencies covers a variety of business activities including contingencies for legal exposures and environmental exposures. We accrue these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We base our estimates on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution. Actual results may differ from our estimates resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on earnings. 29 Table of Contents Consolidated Operations The following table sets forth certain selected financial information for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2004 2003 2002 (Thousands of dollars) Operating revenues, excluding energy trading revenues $ 5,874,266 $ 2,769,214 $ 1,894,851 Energy trading revenues, net 113,814 229,782 209,429 Cost of gas and fuel 4,743,835 1,862,518 1,128,620 Net margin 1,244,245 1,136,478 975,660 Operating costs 565,510 529,553 456,339 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 188,725 160,861 147,843 Operating income $ 490,010 $ 446,064 $ 371,478 Other income $ 17,730 $ 8,164 $ 12,426 Other expense $ 12,127 $ 5,224 $ 19,038 Discontinued operations, net of taxes Income from discontinued component $ $ 2,342 $ 10,648 Gain on sale of discontinued component $ $ 39,739 $ Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ $ (143,885 ) $ Operating Results Changes in commodity prices can have a significant impact on our earnings, particularly in the Production and Gathering and Processing segments. Net margin increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to: a favorable pricing environment for natural gas processing, improved margins resulting from the strategy of restructuring unprofitable gas purchase, gathering and processing contracts, volumes produced from our Texas gas and oil properties acquired in December 2003, the impact of higher prices on our Production segment, and rate relief in our Distribution segment. These increases in net margin were partially offset by the impact of reduced volatility in natural gas prices on our results from the Energy Services segment. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to: additional depreciation, depletion and amortization resulting from the acquisition of the Texas gas and oil properties, regulatory asset amortization resulting from the Kansas and Oklahoma rate cases, increased labor and employee benefit costs and increased production costs related to the acquisition of our Texas gas and oil properties. Net margin increased in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to: higher prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, restructuring of unprofitable contracts in our Gathering and Processing segment, addition of our Texas gas distribution business, implementation of Kansas Gas Services new rate schedule in September 2003, and effective utilization of storage and transport capacity to capture daily price volatility. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization increased in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to: additional costs of operating our Texas gas distribution business and the depreciation on additional assets acquired with that business, higher bad debt expenses due to higher prices, and increased employee and administrative costs. In November 2004, we acquired Northern Plains, which owns 82.5 percent of the general partnership interest and 500,000 limited partnership units, together representing a 2.73 percent ownership interest, in Northern Border Partners, from CCE 30 Table of Contents Holdings, LLC. Northern Border Partners is a master limited partnership formed in 1993 to acquire, own and manage pipeline and other midstream energy assets, focusing on fee based transportation services with minimal commodity risk. In 2004, our equity income includes $1.3 million from Northern Border Partners. The following tables show the components of other income and other expense for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (Thousands of dollars) Interest income $ 1,276 $ 2,961 $ 1,304 Income from benefit plan investments 1,671 2,559 Equity income 2,401 1,489 365 Gains on sale of property 11,269 292 10,485 Other 1,113 863 272 Other Income $ 17,730 $ 8,164 $ 12,426 Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (Thousands of dollars) Donations, civic, and governmental $ 3,117 $ 6,829 $ 6,180 Non operating litigation expense and claims, net 7,033 (2,506 ) 10,153 Terminated acquisition expense 401 175 621 Expense from benefit plan investments 1,304 Loss on sale of property 683 6 Other 893 720 780 Other Expense $ 12,127 $ 5,224 $ 19,038 More information regarding our results of operations is provided in the discussion of each segments results. The discontinued component is discussed in the Production segment section and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is discussed in the Energy Services segment section. Key Performance Indicators Key performance indicators reviewed by management include: EPS, return on invested capital, and shareholder appreciation. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is $2.38 and $2.30, respectively, representing no increase in basic earnings per share and an eight percent increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared to 2003. Return on invested capital is 14.3 percent in 2004 compared to 16.7 percent in 2003. To evaluate shareholder appreciation, we compare ourselves to a group of 20 peer companies. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we ranked in the top 85th percentile in shareholder appreciation compared to our peers. Production Overview Our Production segment owns, develops and produces natural gas and oil reserves in Oklahoma and Texas. We focus on developmental drilling activities rather than exploratory drilling. As a result of our strategy to grow through acquisitions and developmental drilling, the number of wells we operate increases as we grow our producing reserves. We also seek to serve as operator on wells where we have significant ownership interest. In our role as operator, we control operating decisions that impact production volumes and lifting costs, which are the costs incurred to extract natural gas and oil. We continually focus on reducing finding costs, which is the cost per Mcfe of adding proved reserves through drilling, and minimizing production costs. 31 Table of Contents Acquisition and Divestiture The following acquisition and divestiture are discussed beginning on page 26: purchased gas and oil properties and related flow lines in December 2003 sold natural gas and oil producing properties in January 2003 Development Activities Through our developmental drilling program, we participated in drilling 70 wells in 2004, which included 66 producing gas wells, three producing oil wells and one dry hole. At December 31, 2004, 32 wells were still being drilled or completed. In 2003, we participated in drilling 20 wells, which included 19 producing gas wells and one dry hole. Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Production segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2004 2003 2002 (Thousands of dollars) Natural gas sales $ 87,863 $ 35,818 $ 25,693 Oil sales 10,254 7,221 6,654 Other revenues 4,845 949 107 Net revenues 102,962 43,988 32,454 Operating costs 28,590 15,812 8,332 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 26,615 12,070 13,842 Operating income $ 47,757 $ 16,106 $ 10,280 Other income (expense), net $ 60 $ 10 $ (178 ) Discontinued operations, net of taxes (Note C) Income from discontinued component $ $ 2,342 $ 10,648 Gain on sale of discontinued component $ $ 39,739 $ Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ $ 117 $ 32 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2004 2003 2002 Proved reserves (a) Continuing operations Gas (MMcf) 203,277 221,119 61,748 Oil (MBbls) 4,067 4,127 2,461 Discontinued component Gas (MMcf) 177,828 Oil (MBbls) 2,787 Production Continuing operations Gas (MMcf) 16,647 7,486 7,370 Oil (MBbls) 344 265 273 Discontinued component Gas (MMcf) 1,472 18,036 Oil (MBbls) 53 241 Average realized price (b) Continuing operations Gas ($/Mcf) $ 5.28 $ 4.78 $ 3.49 Oil ($/Bbls) $ 29.81 $ 27.25 $ 24.37 Discontinued component Gas ($/Mcf) $ $ 4.10 $ 3.19 Oil ($/Bbls) $ $ 32.28 $ 25.00 Capital expenditures (Thousands of dollars) Continuing operations $ 52,902 $ 18,655 $ 17,810 Discontinued component $ $ $ 21,824 (a) Proved reserves include proved undeveloped reserves which are attributed to locations directly offsetting (adjacent to) existing production. (b) Average realized price reflects the impact of hedging activities. Operating Results Natural gas and oil sales increased in 2004 compared to 2003 due to: increased revenues of $45.9 million resulting from increased production primarily related to the acquisition of our Texas gas and oil producing properties in December 2003, which produced 9.0 Bcf of natural gas and 121 MBbls of oil during 2004, and increased revenues of $9.2 million resulting from higher realized net wellhead natural gas prices. Other revenues increased in 2004 as a result of flow line fees and revenues from our Texas flow line system which was included in the December 2003 purchase. Also, in 2004, operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Texas properties. The significant increases in operating costs were: $4.0 million in lease operating expenses, $6.5 million in overhead costs and taxes, and $2.3 million in flow line expenses. Net margin from continuing operations increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to higher realized gas and oil prices which include the impact of hedging gains and losses. We experienced higher gas production from continuing operations in 2003 compared to 2002, reflecting a partial month of production on the acquired properties. Normal production declines on our gas wells were offset by the production from new wells drilled. Lower oil production in 2003 compared to 2002 was the result of normal production declines on existing wells, as well as no new drilling and minimal acquisition of new wells. 33 Table of Contents Operating costs from continuing operations were higher in 2003 compared to 2002, due to: higher production taxes as a result of higher prices, higher well operating costs due to maintenance and workovers, and higher administrative costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for continuing operations declined in 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily to a lower depletion rate. Reserves The following table sets forth the changes in our proved reserves for the periods indicated for the retained gas and oil properties. Reserves (Bcfe) December 31, 2002 76.5 Revisions in prior estimates (8.1 ) Extensions, discoveries and other additions 15.0 Purchases of minerals in place 171.6 Production (9.1 ) December 31, 2003 245.9 Revisions in prior estimates (23.4 ) Extensions, discoveries and other additions 23.9 Production (18.7 ) December 31, 2004 227.7 Production for 2003 includes ten days of production for the acquired gas and oil properties. The following table sets forth the composition of the proved developed reserves added for the periods indicated which are included in extensions, discoveries and other additions in the reserve table above. Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 (Bcfe) Proved developed producing 3.6 6.6 Proved developed non producing 4.4 3.3 Total proved developed 8.0 9.9 Discontinued Component Income from the discontinued component is significantly lower in 2003 compared to 2002 since the properties produced only one month in 2003 before they were sold. The following table sets forth the changes in our proved reserves for the periods indicated for the discontinued component. Reserves (Bcfe) December 31, 2002 194.6 Sales of minerals in place (192.8 ) Production (1.8 ) December 31, 2003 0.0 Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures primarily relate to our developmental drilling program. Production from existing wells naturally declines over time and additional drilling for existing wells is necessary to maintain or enhance production from existing reserves. Risk Management The volatility of energy prices has a significant impact on the profitability of this segment. We utilize derivative instruments in order to hedge anticipated sales of natural gas and oil production. The realized financial impact of the derivative transactions is included in net margin. 34 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the 2005 hedging information for our Production segment.

Gathering and Processing Overview Our Gathering and Processing segment is engaged in the gathering, processing and marketing of natural gas and fractionation, storage and marketing of NGLs primarily in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. We have active processing capacity of approximately 1.8 Bcf/d. Our Gathering and Processing segment owns approximately 13,800 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plants. Gathering and processing operations include the gathering of natural gas production from gas and oil wells. Through gathering systems, these volumes are aggregated into sufficient volumes to be processed to remove water vapor, solids and other contaminants and to extract NGLs in order to provide marketable natural gas, commonly referred to as residue gas. When the liquids are separated from the raw natural gas at the processing plants, the liquids are generally in the form of a mixed NGL stream. This stream is then separated by a distillation process, referred to as fractionation, into component products (ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline) by third party and company owned fractionation facilities. The component products can then be stored, transported and marketed to a diverse customer base of end users. We generally gather and process gas under three types of contracts. Characteristics of the contract types are as follows. Keep Whole Under a keep whole contract, we extract NGLs and return to the producer volumes of merchantable natural gas containing the same amount of Btus as the raw natural gas that was delivered to us. We retain the NGLs as our fee for processing. Accordingly, we must purchase and return to the producer sufficient volumes of merchantable natural gas to replace the Btus that were removed as NGLs through the gathering and processing operation, commonly referred to as shrink. By using this contract type, the producer is kept whole on a Btu basis. This type of contract exposes us to the keep whole spread or gross processing spread, which is the relative difference in the economic value between NGLs and natural gas on a Btu basis. We typically bear the full cost of the plant fuel consumed in processing under these contracts. The main factors that affect our keep whole margins include: shrink, plant fuel consumed, transportation and fractionation costs incurred on the NGLs, gross processing spread, mid continent natural gas prices, and crude oil prices. Percent of Proceeds (POP) Under a POP contract, we retain a percentage of the NGLs and or a percentage of the natural gas as payment for gathering, compressing and processing the producers raw natural gas. The producer may take its share of the NGLs and natural gas in kind or receive its share of proceeds from our sale of the commodities. We also have POP contracts that have an associated fee contract for providing services such as gathering, dehydration, compression and treating. The POP contract exposes us to both natural gas and NGL commodity price risk, but economically aligns us with the producer because we both benefit from higher commodity prices. There are a variety of factors that directly affect our POP margins, including: the percentages of products retained that represent our equity NGL, condensate and natural gas sales volumes, transportation and fractionation rates incurred on the NGLs, and the mid continent natural gas price, crude price and the daily average OPIS price received for our equity products retained. Additionally, we purchase natural gas at the wellhead under index based purchase agreements that we use for operational purposes, such as fuel and shrink, with the excess being sold monthly at index based prices. 35 Table of Contents Fee Under a fee contract, we are paid a fee for the services provided such as Btus gathered, compressed and or processed. The wellhead volume and fees received for the services provided are the main components of the margin for this type of contract. The producer may take its NGLs and natural gas in kind or receive its proceeds from our sale of the commodities. This type of contract exposes us to minimal commodity price risk. We have been successful in amending contracts covering approximately 22 percent of the volumes associated with our keep whole contracts to allow us to charge conditioning fees for processing when the keep whole spread is negative. This amendment helps mitigate the impact of an unfavorable keep whole spread by effectively converting a keep whole contract to a fee contract during periods of negative keep whole spread. Our effort to add this conditioning language began in 2002 and remains a strategy that we continue to execute today. We are also continuing our strategy of restructuring any unprofitable gas purchase and gathering contracts. Additionally, we modify plant operations to take advantage of market conditions. By changing the temperatures and pressures at which the gas is processed, we can produce more of the specific commodities that have the most favorable prices or price spread. These strategies are used to improve the net margin generated by this segment. We are impacted by producer drilling activity, which is sensitive to geological success as well as availability of capital and commodity prices. We are exposed to volume risk from both a competitive and a production standpoint. We continue to see declines in the fields that supply our gathering and processing operations and the possibility exists that declines may surpass development from new drilling. The factors that typically affect our ability to compete are: the fees charged under the contract, pressures maintained on the gathering systems, location of the gathering systems relative to our competitors, efficiency and reliability of operations, and the delivery capabilities that exist at each plant location. ONEOK NGL Marketing sells our NGL production and also purchases NGLs from third parties for resale to a diverse base of customers. We have 89 MBbls/d of mid continent NGL fractionation capacity. We own and operate two NGL storage facilities in Kansas, with a combined storage capacity of 16 MMBbls, which provide both long and short term storage services. The storage facilities have premier truck and rail loading facilities and have direct pipeline interconnects with the key NGL pipelines, NGL storage facilities and refiners in the mid continent region. The results of our storage operations are impacted by: NGL supply and demand requirements of regional refineries, NGL production in the mid continent, Rockies and Canada, Midwest demand for propane, the petrochemical industrys level of capacity utilization and their specific feedstock requirements, efficiency and reliability of operations, and the delivery capabilities that exist at each location. The main factors that affect our ONEOK NGL Marketing margins are: fees charged for storage, transportation and fractionation costs, fees for marketing services, and margins on NGL sales. Acquisition and Divestiture The following acquisition and divestiture are described beginning on page 26: acquired NGL storage and pipeline facilities located in Conway, Kansas in December 2003 sold three natural gas processing plants and related gathering assets along with our interest in a fourth natural gas processing plant in December 2002 36 Table of Contents Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Gathering and Processing segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2004 2003 2002 (Thousands of dollars) Natural gas liquids and condensate sales $ 1,243,556 $ 1,041,764 $ 654,930 Gas sales 669,956 640,499 380,095 Gathering, compression, dehydration and processing fees and other revenues 106,585 96,254 98,196 Cost of sales and fuel 1,728,652 1,564,380 938,843 Net margin 291,445 214,137 194,378 Operating costs 127,552 122,103 127,747 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 32,863 29,332 33,523 Operating income $ 131,030 $ 62,702 $ 33,108 Other income (expense), net $ 338 $ (194 ) $ (1,119 ) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ $ (1,375 ) $ Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2004 2003 2002 Total gas gathered (MMMBtu/d) 1,099 1,171 1,205 Total gas processed (MMMBtu/d) 1,172 1,209 1,411 Natural gas liquids sales (MBbls/d) 109 114 95 Natural gas liquids produced (MBbls/d) 62 59 73 Gas sales (MMMBtu/d) 328 330 343 Capital expenditures (Thousands of dollars) $ 32,331 $ 20,598 $ 43,101 Conway OPIS composite NGL price ($/gal) (based on our NGL product mix) $ 0.72 $ 0.59 $ 0.41 Average NYMEX crude oil price ($/Bbl) $ 41.34 $ 30.98 $ 25.41 Average realized condensate price ($/Bbl) $ 38.17 $ 28.68 $ 22.59 Average natural gas price ($/MMBtu) (mid continent region) $ 5.54 $ 5.06 $ 3.00 Gross processing spread ($/MMBtu) $ 2.47 $ 1.36 $ 1.52 Operating Results The increase in net margin in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily due to: an increase of $16.8 million due to favorable commodity pricing for natural gas and NGL products on our POP contracts, an increase of $50.2 million attributable to our keep whole contracts due primarily to an increase in our gross processing spread, and an increase of $10.2 million related to our renegotiation of certain NGL storage agreements and the addition of NGL storage and pipeline assets located in Conway, Kansas. In 2004, particularly the third and fourth quarters, the gross processing spread, which is the relative difference in the economic value between NGLs and natural gas on a Btu basis, was considerably higher than the previous five year average of $1.58. Improved contractual terms for gas gathering and processing resulting from our continued efforts to restructure unprofitable gas purchase and gathering contracts continues to positively impact net margin. The increase in operating costs in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily attributable to approximately $3.6 million of charges associated with various contractual dispute settlements in 2004. Employee costs were also $2.7 million higher in 2004 compared to 2003. 37 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to shorter depreciation lives on certain capital expenditures, the acquisition of new properties and our normal capital expenditure program. Increased prices for NGLs, natural gas and crude oil positively impacted net margin by $32.6 million in 2003 when compared to 2002. These increases affected: NGLs and condensate sales revenues, gas sales, cost of sales, and net revenues. In addition, our contractual restructuring efforts and our Texas propane business, which we sold in 2004, added approximately $16.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively, to net margin in 2003. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $9.5 million due to lower gas and NGL volumes processed in 2003 as a result of natural well declines. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we sold an Oklahoma processing plant and gathering assets which reduced 2003 net margin by approximately $19.4 million and operating costs by approximately $6 million. Operating costs were also impacted by a $5.1 million reduction in bad debt expenses in 2003. The decreases in operating costs were partially offset by increases in various other expenses, including $2.9 million in additional costs for the operation of our Texas retail propane business. Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 as a result of owning fewer assets following the sale of a portion of our Oklahoma assets in 2002, which reduced depreciation expense approximately $2.8 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately $1 million related to our normal 2003 capital expenditure program and the acquisition of our Texas retail propane assets. Additionally, 2002 depreciation expense included a $2.4 million loss taken in the third quarter associated with the sale of a portion of our Oklahoma assets. In 2002, other income (expense), net includes an additional loss of $1.3 million that was recognized when the Oklahoma assets were sold in December 2002. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures increased in 2004 primarily due to the construction of a new 33 mile NGL pipeline that connects our Kansas NGL storage facilities at Bushton and Conway. This pipeline cost approximately $9.2 million and was in service by December 31, 2004. Risk Management We use derivative instruments to minimize the risks associated with price volatility. In 2004, we used a variety of instruments including physical forward sales, NYMEX natural gas futures, NYMEX crude oil futures and over the counter natural gas basis swaps to hedge the cash flows for the purchases and sales of natural gas, sales of condensate and sales of NGLs produced by our operations. We used physical forward sales and derivative instruments to secure a certain price for natural gas, condensate and NGL products. The keep whole spread is hedged with a combination of derivative instruments for the purchase of natural gas and derivative instruments and physical forward sales for NGLs. The realized financial impact of the derivative transactions is included in our operating income in the period that the physical transaction occurs. 38 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the 2005 hedging information for our Gathering and Processing segment for the periods indicated.

See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Transportation and Storage Overview Our Transportation and Storage segment represents our intrastate natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas storage and some gas gathering facilities. We also provide interstate transportation service under Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act. We own or reserve capacity in five storage facilities in Oklahoma, three in Kansas and three in Texas, with a combined working capacity of approximately 59.6 Bcf, of which 8.0 Bcf is temporarily idle. We operate approximately 5,600 miles of gathering and intrastate transmission pipelines in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas where we are regulated by the OCC, KCC, and RRC, respectively. We have a peak transportation capacity of 2.9 Bcf/d. The majority of our revenues are derived from services provided to affiliates. We primarily serve LDCs, large industrial companies, irrigation, power generation facilities and marketing companies. We compete directly with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage facilities. Competition for transportation services continues to increase as the FERC and state regulatory bodies continue to encourage more competition in the natural gas markets. Factors that affect competition are location, natural gas prices, fees for services and quality of service provided. Our business is affected by the economy, natural gas price volatility and weather. The strength of the economy has a direct relationship on manufacturing and the resulting demand for natural gas used in the manufacturing process. Transportation throughput fluctuates due to rainfall that impacts irrigation demand, hot temperatures that affect power generation demand and cold temperatures that affect heating demand. Volatility in the natural gas market also impacts our customers decisions relating to injection and withdrawal of natural gas in storage. Periodically, reassessments are made related to the amount of operational inventory needed to operate our storage facilities. As a result, we may sell a portion of our operational gas inventory, which allows us to increase our storage capacity. Acquisition and Divestiture The following acquisition and divestiture are described beginning on page 26: sold transmission and gathering pipelines and compression facilities in March 2004 acquired transmission assets as part of the purchase of our Texas assets in January 2003 39 Table of Contents Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Transportation and Storage segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2004 2003 2002 (Thousands of dollars) Transportation and gathering revenues $ 101,950 $ 102,812 $ 89,349 Storage revenues 45,791 42,086 37,101 Gas sales and other revenues 19,694 16,401 37,784 Cost of sales and fuel 40,887 47,637 46,650 Net margin 126,548 113,662 117,584 Operating costs 49,414 46,186 46,694 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 17,349 16,694 17,563 Operating income $ 59,785 $ 50,782 $ 53,327 Other income (expense), net $ 2,835 $ 1,495 $ 4,649 Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ $ (645 ) $ Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2004 2003 2002 Volumes transported (MMcf) 432,844 449,261 507,972 Capital expenditures (Thousands of dollars) $ 12,287 $ 15,234 $ 20,554 Average natural gas price ($/MMBtu) (mid continent region) $ 5.54 $ 5.06 $ 3.00 Operating Results Net margin, which increased in 2004 compared to 2003, was impacted by: an increase of $8.9 million related to the sale of operational gas inventory in December 2004, increased storage revenues of $2.4 million due to spot storage transactions resulting from the weather and favorable forward pricing in 2004, decreased cost of sales and fuel of $1.7 million primarily related to lower transportation volumes partially offset by increased fuel consumed and higher fuel prices, resulting from increased storage activity, and decreased volumes transported as a result of milder and wetter weather reducing irrigation, power generation and heating demands. The increase in operating costs in 2004 compared to 2003 is due to: increased regulatory and pipeline integrity compliance costs of $2.9 million and higher employee costs and legal costs for settled litigation. In 2004, other income (expense), net includes the gain on the sale of the Texas assets of $6.9 million, which is partially offset by litigation costs. The increase in prices for natural gas for 2003 compared to 2002 contributed to increases in: transportation and gathering revenues, storage revenues, and cost of sales and fuel. Additionally, we saw a decrease in gas sales and other revenues in 2003 compared to 2002. In 2002, we sold 7.2 Bcf of our operational inventory, which resulted in a positive impact on net margins of $12.7 million and allowed us to increase our storage capacity available in future periods. There was no comparable transaction in 2003. The increased storage capacity allowed us to earn an additional $1.4 million of net margin in 2003. The sale of the operational inventory in 2002 was partially offset by adjustments related to the reconciliation of third party contractual storage and pipeline imbalance positions, which decreased net margin by $8.9 million. In 2002, other income (expense), net included gains on the sale of storage assets in Oklahoma and transmission assets in Texas. 40 Table of Contents Distribution Overview Our Distribution segment provides natural gas distribution services to approximately 2 million customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. Operations are conducted through Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service, respectively. We serve residential, commercial, industrial and transportation customers in all three states. In Oklahoma and Kansas, we also serve wholesale customers and in Texas, we also serve public authority customers. Our Distribution segment provides gas service to approximately 86 percent, 71 percent, and 14 percent of the distribution markets of Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas, respectively. Oklahoma Natural Gas and Kansas Gas Service are subject to regulatory oversight by the OCC and KCC, respectively. Texas Gas Service is subject to regulatory oversight by the various municipalities that it serves, which have primary jurisdiction in their respective areas. Texas Gas Services rates in areas adjacent to the various municipalities and appellate matters are subject to regulatory oversight by the RRC. This segment also includes an interstate gas transportation company, OkTex Pipeline, which is regulated by the FERC. Our Distribution segments operating results are primarily impacted by the number of customers, usage and the ability to establish delivery rates that provide an authorized rate of return on our investment and cost of service. Gas sales to residential and commercial customers are seasonal, as a substantial portion of gas is used principally for heating. Accordingly, the volume of gas sales is consistently higher during the heating season (November through March) than in other months of the year. In order to consolidate the three customer service systems in our Distribution segment and provide better customer service, we are implementing a new customer service system. The system was installed in Texas and Kansas in June 2004 and September 2004, respectively. We expect to install the system in Oklahoma in the future. We have implemented control processes and performed extensive testing on this system. This resulted in us identifying certain implementation issues which we are addressing. As with any implementation, there are inherent risks and uncertainties that could negatively impact us; however, we do not believe they will have a material impact on our financial statements or internal control structure. Acquisition The following acquisition is described beginning on page 26: acquired Texas gas distribution assets in January 2003 Selected Financial Information The following table sets forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Distribution segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2004 2003 2002 (Thousands of dollars) Gas sales $ 1,816,697 $ 1,640,323 $ 1,140,257 Cost of gas 1,367,186 1,213,811 806,251 Gross margin 449,511 426,512 334,006 Transportation revenues 82,006 75,322 59,877 Other revenues 25,799 24,415 20,510 Net margin 557,316 526,249 414,393 Operating costs 341,651 312,814 243,170 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 105,438 95,654 76,063 Operating income $ 110,227 $ 117,781 $ 95,160 Other income (expense), net $ 1,375 $ (278 ) $ (3,183 ) Operating Results Gas costs are passed through to distribution customers based on the actual cost of gas purchased by the respective distribution division. Substantial swings in gas sales can occur from year to year without significantly impacting our gross margin since most factors that affect gas sales also affect cost of gas by an equivalent amount. Gross margin increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to the implementation of new rate schedules in Kansas and Oklahoma, which added $22.0 million and $14.5 million, respectively. These increases in gross margin were partially offset by: decreased revenues of $4.9 million due to the impact of reduced customer usage in Kansas and Oklahoma primarily attributable to the impact of warmer weather on customers not subject to weather normalization, and increased line loss expense of $2.4 million, net of rider recoveries, in Oklahoma. 41 Table of Contents Transportation revenues increased in 2004 compared to 2003 due to the acquisitions of the distribution system at the United States Armys Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas and a pipeline system that extends through the Rio Grande Valley region in Texas, both in August 2003. Additionally, certain commercial and industrial customers in Oklahoma have converted to transportation rates as a result of lower volume thresholds to qualify for transportation rates, which increased transportation revenue by $1.5 million and decreased gross margin by an equivalent amount. Operating costs, which increased in 2004 compared to 2003, were impacted by: increased information technology costs of $7.6 million, primarily associated with our customer service system, and increased employee costs of $18.9 million. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased due to: amortization expense of $5.7 million related to the new rate schedules in Kansas and Oklahoma and depreciation expense of $4.1 million related to our investment in property, plant and equipment. In 2003, gross margin increased compared to 2002 due to: the addition of Texas Gas Service operations and implementation of Kansas Gas Services new rate schedule in September 2003. The $14.2 million reduction in gas costs in the second quarter of 2002 that resulted from the OCC Joint Stipulation offset part of these increases. The addition of Texas Gas Services operations contributed approximately $91.0 million to gross margin, $106.7 million to net margin and $25.1 million to operating income for 2003. Operating income also increased in 2003 compared to 2002 by approximately $9.8 million as a result of the implementation of Kansas Gas Services new rate schedule. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization increased in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to: the addition of Texas Gas Services operations, increased bad debt expense resulting from higher gas costs, and increased employee costs. Selected Operating Data The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Distribution segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2004 2003 2002 Average number of customers 2,008,835 1,990,757 1,439,657 Customers per employee 664 652 623 Capital expenditures (Thousands of dollars) $ 142,515 $ 153,405 $ 115,569 Years Ended December 31, Volumes (MMcf) 2004 2003 2002 Gas sales Residential 123,388 126,998 104,559 Commercial 41,984 45,054 36,459 Industrial 2,513 3,442 3,240 Wholesale 32,265 29,823 32,082 Public Authority 2,748 2,645 Total volumes sold 202,898 207,962 176,340 Transportation 239,914 231,425 194,706 Total volumes delivered 442,812 439,387 371,046 42 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, Margin 2004 2003 2002 (Thousands of dollars) Gas sales Residential $ 344,486 $ 325,540 $ 243,914 Commercial 92,793 89,581 69,410 Industrial 3,496 3,183 2,696 Wholesale 5,347 5,033 3,089 Public Authority 3,389 3,175 Regulatory adjustment 14,897 Gross margin 449,511 426,512 334,006 Transportation 82,006 75,322 59,877 Total margin $ 531,517 $ 501,834 $ 393,883 Residential, commercial and industrial volumes decreased in 2004 compared to 2003 due to: warmer weather, which primarily affects residential and commercial customers, and the continued migration of commercial and industrial customers to new transportation rates as a result of lower minimum transport thresholds in Oklahoma. Wholesale gas sales, also known as as available gas sales, represent gas volumes available under contracts that exceed the needs of our residential and commercial customer base and are available for sale to other parties. Wholesale volumes increased in 2004 compared to 2003 as fewer volumes were required to meet the needs of residential, commercial and industrial customers resulting in greater volumes available for wholesale customers. Public authority volumes, which remained relatively flat in 2004 compared to 2003, reflect volumes used by state agencies and school districts serviced by Texas Gas Service. Transportation volumes increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to: the acquisitions of the distribution system at the United States Armys Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas and a pipeline system that extends through the Rio Grande Valley region in Texas, the continued migration of commercial and industrial customers to new transportation rates as a result of lower minimum transport thresholds in Oklahoma, and Oklahoma Natural Gas marketing effort to add small usage transport customers. Overall, gas volumes increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to the addition of our Texas Gas Service customers. The combination of greater demand by Kansas retail customers in the first quarter of 2003 due to colder weather and increased volumes of gas injected into storage resulted in lower wholesale volumes available for sale in 2003. Transportation sales were also impacted by the initial migration of commercial and industrial customers to new transportation rates due to lower minimum transport thresholds in Oklahoma in 2003. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditure program includes expenditures for extending service to new areas, modifying customer service lines, increasing system capabilities, general replacements and improvements. It is our practice to maintain and periodically upgrade facilities to assure safe, reliable, and efficient operations. Our capital expenditure program included $35.0 million, $33.5 million and $18.3 million for new business development in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Oklahoma Regulatory Initiatives On January 28, 2005, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed a rate case with the OCC requesting annual rate relief of approximately $99.4 million, of which $38.5 million would be paid in additional income taxes. This amount includes $10.7 million of the interim rate relief granted in January 2004 and discussed below. The OCC has 180 days to issue a final order on the rate case. If approved, the new rates will take effect prior to the 2005/2006 heating season. Until a final order is received, Oklahoma Natural Gas will operate under its current rate schedule. On January 30, 2004, the OCC issued an order allowing Oklahoma Natural Gas annual rate relief of $17.7 million in order to recover expenses related to its investment in service lines and cathodic protection, an increased level of uncollectible revenues, and a return on Oklahoma Natural Gas service lines and gas in storage investment. The OCCs order also approved a modified distribution main extension policy and authorized Oklahoma Natural Gas to defer expected homeland security costs. The order authorized the new rates to be in effect for a maximum of 18 months and categorizes $10.7 million of the annual additional revenues as interim and subject to refund until a final determination at Oklahoma Natural Gas next 43 Table of Contents general rate case, which was filed on January 28, 2005. We believe any refund obligation is remote and, accordingly, have not recorded a reserve. Approximately $7.0 million annually is considered final and not subject to refund. A Joint Stipulation approved by the OCC on May 16, 2002, settled a number of outstanding Oklahoma Natural Gas cases pending before the OCC. The major cases settled were the OCCs inquiry into our gas cost procurement practices during the winter of 2000/2001, an application seeking relief from improper and excessive purchased gas costs, and enforcement action against Oklahoma Natural Gas, our subsidiaries and affiliated companies. In addition, all of the open inquiries related to the annual audits of Oklahoma Natural Gas fuel adjustment clause for 1996 to 2000 were closed as a result of this Stipulation. The Stipulation has a $33.7 million value to Oklahoma Natural Gas customers that will be realized over a three year period. In July 2002, immediate cash savings were provided to all Oklahoma Natural Gas customers in the form of billing credits totaling approximately $9.1 million. In December 2005, a final billing credit will be made to customers. The minimum amount of this credit is estimated to be approximately $2.8 million. Oklahoma Natural Gas replaced certain gas contracts, which reduced gas costs by approximately $13.8 million, due to avoided reservation fees between April 2003 and October 2005. Additional savings of approximately $8.0 million from the use of storage gas are expected to occur between November 2003 and March 2005. Any expected savings from the use of storage that are not achieved will be added to the final billing credit scheduled to be provided to customers in December 2005. Oklahoma Natural Gas operating income increased in the second quarter of 2002 by $14.2 million as a result of this settlement. To protect against fuel procurement volatility, Oklahoma Natural Gas exercised provisions contained in a number of its gas supply contracts that allow us to fix the price for a portion of its gas supply. Oklahoma Natural Gas fixed the price of approximately 28 percent, 43 percent and 37 percent of its anticipated 2004/2005, 2003/2004 and 2002/2003 winter gas supply deliveries, respectively. Kansas Regulatory Initiatives On September 17, 2003, the KCC issued an order approving $45 million in rate relief pursuant to the stipulated settlement agreement with Kansas Gas Service. The order settled the rate case filed by Kansas Gas Service in January 2003 and allowed Kansas Gas Service to begin operating under the new rate schedules effective September 22, 2003. After amortization of previously deferred costs, annual operating income increased by approximately $25.8 million. Texas Regulatory Initiatives On November 12, 2003, Texas Gas Service filed an appeal with the RRC based on the denial of proposed rate filing by the cities of Port Neches, Nederland and Groves, Texas. In July 2004, the RRC approved approximately $0.9 million in annual revenue relief. The interim rates were implemented in May 2003. On October 7, 2004, Texas Gas Service filed a petition in the District Court of Travis County, Texas seeking judicial review of certain of the ratemaking decisions contained in the RRCs final order. General Certain costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process have been recorded as regulatory assets in accordance with Statement 71. Should recovery cease due to regulatory actions, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria of Statement 71 and, accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. Energy Services Overview Our Energy Services segment primarily purchases, stores, transports and markets natural gas in the retail and wholesale sector throughout most of the United States. We have a large leased storage and pipeline capacity position, primarily in the mid continent region of the United States, with total transportation capacity of 1.7 Bcf/d. With total cyclical storage capacity of 83.5 Bcf, maximum withdrawal capability of 2.3 Bcf/d and maximum injection capability of 1.5 Bcf/d spread across 18 different facilities, we have direct access to most regions of the country and flexibility to capture volatility in the energy markets. Due to the seasonality of supply and demand balances, earnings will be significantly higher during the winter months than the summer months. We recently extended our energy services operations into Canada by leasing storage and pipeline capacity, allowing us to bring gas supply from western Canada into the market areas of the upper midwestern and northeastern parts of the United States. We also trade natural gas and power on a smaller scale. We continue to enhance our customer focused strategy by providing reliable service during peak demand periods through the use of our storage and transportation capacities. The physical and financial energy services we provide help our customers execute their commodity procurement and asset management strategies. 44 Table of Contents Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Energy Services segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2004 2003 2002 (Thousands of dollars) Energy and power revenues $ 2,820,219 $ 91,004 $ 71,749 Energy trading revenues, net 113,814 229,782 209,429 Other revenues 849 961 948 Cost of sales and fuel 2,756,810 85,378 67,646 Net margin 178,072 236,369 214,480 Operating costs 34,669 33,699 27,674 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 5,611 5,708 5,298 Operating income $ 137,792 $ 196,962 $ 181,508 Other income (expense), net $ (6,920 ) $ (9,272 ) $ (4,871 ) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ $ (141,982 ) $ Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2004 2003 2002 Natural gas marketed (Bcf) 1,073 1,012 999 Natural gas gross margin ($/Mcf) $ 0.14 $ 0.17 $ 0.13 Electricity marketed (MMwh) 4,881 2,086 2,228 Physically settled volumes (Bcf) 2,157 2,028 1,990 Capital expenditures (Thousands of dollars) $ 1,806 $ 555 $ 2,340 Operating Results Net margin was negatively impacted in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to: a decrease of $43.7 million in margins from marketing and seasonal gas sales from storage resulting from lower inter regional basis spreads early in 2004, a decrease of $35.9 million attributable to lower natural gas price volatility and the impact it had on our trading margins, and a decrease of $4.7 million resulting from weaker spark spreads in the Southwest Power Pool and ERCOT. These decreases in net margin were partially offset by: increased revenues of $9.5 million in reservation fees received for natural gas peaking services and increased revenues of $20.5 million related to the seasonal spread which resulted in increased sales volumes as we recycled gas in storage during the fourth quarter of 2004. Included in net margin is the change in value of our derivative instruments subject to fair value accounting pursuant to Statement 133, which resulted in a gain of $39.1 million and $38.7 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Natural gas volumes increased in 2004 compared to 2003 due to our expanded Canadian operations and higher natural gas storage inventory levels at the beginning of 2004, which shifted purchased volumes from storage injections to regional sales. Our natural gas storage inventory level at December 31, 2004 was 70.6 Bcf, or 76.5 percent of capacity, compared to 68.5 Bcf, or 85 percent of capacity, at December 31, 2003. At the beginning of the third quarter of 2004, we completed a reorganization of our Energy Services segment and renewed our focus on our physical marketing and storage business. We separated the management and operations of our wholesale marketing, retail marketing and trading activities and began accounting separately for the different types of revenue earned from these activities. Prior to the third quarter, we managed the Energy Services segment on an integrated basis and presented all energy trading activity on a net basis. Concurrent with this reorganization, we evaluated the accounting treatment related to the presentation of revenues from the different types of activities to determine which amounts should be reported on a gross or net basis under the guidance in EITF Issue No. 03 11, Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB 45 Table of Contents Statement No. 133 and Not Held for Trading Purposes as Defined in EITF Issue No. 02 3 (EITF 03 11). For derivative instruments considered held for trading purposes that result in physical delivery, the indicators in EITF Issue No. 02 3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities were used to determine the proper treatment. These activities and all financially settled derivative contracts will continue to be reported on a net basis. For derivative instruments that are not considered held for trading purposes and that result in physical delivery, the indicators in EITF 03 11 and EITF Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent (EITF 99 19) were used to determine the proper treatment. We began accounting for the realized revenues and purchase costs of these contracts that result in physical delivery on a gross basis beginning with the third quarter of 2004. We apply the indicators in EITF 99 19 to determine the appropriate accounting treatment for non derivative contracts that result in physical delivery. Derivatives that qualify for the normal purchase or sale exception as defined in Statement 133 are also reported on a gross basis. Prior periods have not been adjusted for this change; therefore, comparisons to prior periods may not be meaningful. Reporting of these transactions on a gross basis did not impact operating income but resulted in an increase to revenues and cost of sales and fuel. Marketing and Storage activities primarily include physical marketing (purchase and sales) using our firm storage and transportation capacity, including cash flow and fair value hedges and other derivative instruments to manage our risk associated with these activities. The combination of owning supply, controlling strategic assets and risk management services allows us to provide commodity diverse products and services to our customers such as peaking and load following services. Power activities are also included in the Marketing and Storage business. Retail Marketing includes revenues from providing physical marketing and supply services to residential and small commercial and industrial customers. Financial trading revenues include activities that are generally executed using financially settled derivatives. These activities are normally short term in nature with a focus of capturing short term price volatility. The following table shows the margins by activity, beginning with our reorganization on July 1, 2004. Six Months Ended December 31, 2004 (Thousands of dollars) Marketing and storage, gross $ 127,851 Less: Storage and transportation costs (72,661 ) Marketing and storage, net 55,190 Retail marketing 8,628 Financial trading 24,638 Net margin $ 88,456 The increase in net margin in 2003 compared to 2002 is attributable to the effective utilization of our storage and transport capacity to capture the increased intra month price volatility in early 2003 when daily price volatility was higher compared to 2002. Net margins for 2002 include mark to market earnings of approximately $42.6 million, which represents the change in energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities in 2002 resulting from the application of mark to market accounting on all energy contracts pursuant to EITF 98 10. These mark to market earnings include revenues associated with storage injections. Historically, net revenues were recognized under fair value accounting as physical natural gas inventories were injected into storage during the second and third quarters. With the rescission of EITF 98 10, natural gas inventories carried under storage agreements are no longer carried at fair value, but rather are accounted for on an accrual basis at lower of cost or market with revenues recorded when the gas is sold, typically in the first and fourth quarters. 46 Table of Contents In the first quarter of 2002, we sold our bankruptcy claims in the Enron Corp. and Enron North America Corp. (ENA) bankruptcies, which increased net margin by $10.4 million. The sale was subject to normal representations as to the validity, but not collectibility, of the claims and guarantees from Enron Corp. and ENA. The claims were sold with recourse under certain conditions. We have repurchased a portion of the Enron Corp. guaranty claim that Enron Corp. sought to avoid in the adversary proceeding. We are now providing the defense of the adversary proceeding for both the portion of the guaranty claim constituting the repurchased claim and also the portion of the guaranty claim previously sold. In addition to the adversary proceeding, Enron Corp. and ENA have filed a new objection to portions of the guaranty claim and to portions of the underlying claim against ENA, creating a new contested matter in the Enron Corp. and ENA bankruptcy cases which involve different legal and factual issues than those raised in the adversary proceeding. Enron Corp. and ENA allege in this matter that the guaranty claim and underlying claim against ENA are overstated. The filing of this matter may trigger additional obligations for us to repurchase some of the claims previously sold. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on us. In 2003, we also benefited from an increase in our natural gas retail operations, which expanded into Wyoming, Nebraska and Texas, and an increase in power related margins due to our expansion into ERCOT in the fourth quarter of 2003. Operating costs increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to our expanded retail operations and an increase in ad valorem taxes on our storage inventory due to rate adjustments. Other income (expense), net includes the accrual of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) settlement in 2003. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Part of our strategy is to grow through acquisitions that strengthen and complement our existing assets. We have relied primarily on operating cash flow, borrowings from commercial paper and credit agreements, and issuance of debt and equity in the capital markets for our liquidity and capital resource requirements. We expect to continue to use these sources for liquidity and capital resource needs on both a short and long term basis. We have no material guarantees of debt or other commitments to unaffiliated parties. During 2003 and 2004, our capital expenditures were financed through operating cash flows and short and long term debt. Capital expenditures for 2004 were $264 million compared to $215 million in 2003, exclusive of any acquisitions. Financing Financing is provided through our commercial paper program and long term debt. We also have a credit agreement, as discussed below, which is used as a back up for the commercial paper program. Other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuance of equity, issuance of mandatory convertible debt securities, issuance of trust preferred securities by ONEOK Capital Trust I or ONEOK Capital Trust II, asset securitization and sale/leaseback of facilities. We used commercial paper to finance the acquisition of Northern Plains. In September 2004, we entered into a $1.0 billion five year credit agreement. The principal amount of the credit facility may be increased by $200 million if requested by us and the corresponding incremental commitments are received from new or existing lenders. The interest rate is a floating rate based at our election on either (i) the higher of prime or one half of one percent above the Federal Funds Overnight Rate, which is the rate that banks charge each other for the overnight borrowing of funds, or (ii) the Eurodollar rate plus a set number of basis points based on our current long term unsecured debt ratings by Moodys Investors Service and Standard and Poors Rating Services (S&P). The credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including covenants relating to liens, investments, fundamental changes in our business, changes in the nature of our business, transactions with affiliates, the use of proceeds, a limit on our debt to capital ratio, a limit on investments in master limited partnerships and a covenant that prevents us from restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to ONEOK, Inc. At December 31, 2004, we had no amounts outstanding under this credit agreement. We entered into an agreement with KBC Bank NV in April 2004. The agreement gives us access to an uncommitted line of credit for loans and letters of credit up to a maximum principal amount of $10 million. The rate charged on any outstanding amount is the higher of prime or one half of one percent above the Fed Funds overnight rate. This agreement remains in effect until canceled by KBC Bank NV. This agreement does not contain any covenants more restrictive than those in our $1.0 billion five year credit agreement. At December 31, 2004, we had no amounts outstanding under this credit agreement. Certain other long term debt agreements have negative covenants that relate to liens and sale/leaseback transactions. The total amount of short term borrowings authorized by our Board of Directors is $1.2 billion. At December 31, 2004, we had $644 million in commercial paper outstanding and approximately $9.5 million in cash and temporary investments. We also had $1.9 billion of long term debt outstanding, including current maturities. As of December 31, 2004, we could have 47 Table of Contents issued $1.7 billion of additional long term debt under the most restrictive provisions contained in our various borrowing agreements. The following table sets forth our capitalization structure for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Long term debt 54 % 60 % Equity 46 % 40 % Debt (including Notes payable) 61 % 67 % Equity 39 % 33 % Both S&P and Moodys Investment Services consider the equity units we issued in January 2003 to be part equity and part debt. For purposes of computing capitalization ratios, these rating agencies adjust the capitalization structure. S&P considers the equity units to be equal amounts of debt and equity for the first three years, with the effect being to increase shareholders equity by the same amount as long term debt, which would result in a capitalization structure of 52 percent equity and 48 percent long term debt at December 31, 2004. Moodys Investment Services considers 25 percent of the equity units to be long term debt and 75 percent to be shareholders equity, which would result in a capitalization structure of 55 percent equity and 45 percent long term debt at December 31, 2004. Since September 17, 2004, the Thrift Plan for Employees of ONEOK, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Thrift Plan) has from time to time purchased shares of our common stock on the open market to meet the purchase requirements generated by participants in the Thrift Plan. Previously, the Thrift Plan used newly issued shares to meet the participants purchase requirements. All participant purchases under this plan are voluntary. We use newly issued shares to meet the purchase requirements generated by our Dividend Reinvestment Plan and our Long Term Incentive Plan. On March 1, 2005, we had $335 million of long term debt mature. We funded this payment with working capital and the issuance of commercial paper in the short term market. We have 16.1 million equity units outstanding at December 31, 2004. Each unit consists of two components, an equity purchase contract and a note (see Notes H and J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for additional information). In November 2005, we will remarket the notes and will put the cash received into a treasury portfolio pledged as collateral against the purchase contracts. This action will have no effect on our liquidity. In February 2006, the purchase contracts are required to be exercised. This will result in our receipt of $402.5 million and the issuance of common shares of stock, the number of which will depend upon the average closing price of our common stock for the 20 trading days prior to the date of issuance. For more information, refer to the discussion in Financing Cash Flows or to our Prospectus Supplement dated January 23, 2003. Currently, we have $848.2 million available under one of our shelf registration statements on Form S 3, for the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, debt securities, preferred stock, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units. We also have $402.5 million remaining under another shelf registration statement on Form S 3 to cover the issuance of common stock required upon settlement of the forward purchase contracts that are part of the equity units. Stock Buy Back Program In January 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a stock buy back program to repurchase up to 7.5 million shares of our common stock currently issued and outstanding. The shares will be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. The program will terminate after two years, unless extended by our Board of Directors. Credit Rating Our credit ratings are currently a BBB+ (stable outlook) by S&P and a Baa1 (stable outlook) by Moodys Investors Service. Our credit ratings may be affected by a material change in our financial ratios or a material adverse event affecting our business. The most common criteria for assessment of our credit ratings are the debt to capital ratio, pretax and after tax interest coverage and liquidity. If our credit ratings were downgraded, the interest rates on our commercial paper would increase, resulting in an increase in our cost to borrow funds and we could potentially lose access to commercial paper borrowings. In the event that we are unable to borrow funds under our commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in our business, we have access to a $1.0 billion credit agreement, which expires September 16, 2009. 48 Table of Contents Our Energy Services segment relies upon the investment grade rating of our senior unsecured long term debt to satisfy credit requirements with most of our counterparties. If our credit ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to participate in energy marketing and trading activities could be significantly limited. Without an investment grade rating, we may be required to fund margin requirements with our counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments. At December 31, 2004, the amount we could have been required to fund for the few counterparties with which we have a Credit Support Annex within our International Swaps and Derivatives Association Agreements is approximately $40.2 million. A decline in our credit rating below investment grade may also significantly impact other business segments. We have reviewed our commercial paper agreement, trust indentures, building leases, equipment leases, and marketing, trading and risk contracts and other various contracts which may be subject to rating triggers and no such triggers were identified. Rating triggers are defined as provisions that would create an automatic default or acceleration of indebtedness based on a change in our credit rating. The revolving credit agreement contains a provision that would cause the cost to borrow funds to increase based on the amount borrowed under this agreement if our credit rating is negatively adjusted. The credit agreement also contains a default provision based on a material adverse change. An adverse rating change is not defined as a default or material adverse change. We currently do not have any funds borrowed under this credit agreement. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price volatility. Significant fluctuations in commodity price in either physical or financial energy contracts may impact our overall liquidity due to the impact the commodity price change has on items such as the cost of NGLs and gas held in storage, increased margin requirements, collectibility of certain energy related receivables and working capital. We believe that our current commercial paper program and debt capacity are adequate to meet our liquidity requirements associated with commodity price volatility. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans We calculate benefit obligations based upon generally accepted actuarial methodologies using the projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans. The determination of pension costs and other postretirement obligations as of December 31 are determined using a September 30 measurement date. The benefit obligations are the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed to employee service rendered. The PBO is measured using the pension benefit formula and assumptions as to future compensation levels. A plans funded status is calculated as the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. Our funding policy for the pension plans is to make annual contributions in accordance with regulations under the Internal Revenue Code and in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles. Contributions made to the pension plan and postretirement benefit plan in 2004 were $6.8 million and $17.2 million, respectively. For 2005, we anticipate our total contributions to be $1.8 million and $16.1 million, respectively. We will be reimbursed approximately $2.3 million by Northern Border Partners for defined benefit pension plan expenses that we incur for them. We believe we have adequate resources to fund our obligations under our pension plan. Oklahoma Corporation Commission A Joint Stipulation approved by the OCC on May 16, 2002, settled a number of outstanding Oklahoma Natural Gas cases pending before the OCC. The major cases settled were the OCCs inquiry into our gas cost procurement practices during the winter of 2000/2001, an application seeking relief from improper and excessive purchased gas costs, and enforcement action against Oklahoma Natural Gas, our subsidiaries and affiliated companies. In addition, all of the open inquiries related to the annual audits of Oklahoma Natural Gas fuel adjustment clause for 1996 to 2000 were closed as a result of this Stipulation. The Stipulation has a $33.7 million value to Oklahoma Natural Gas customers that will be realized over a three year period. In July 2002, immediate cash savings were provided to all Oklahoma Natural Gas customers in the form of billing credits totaling approximately $9.1 million. In December 2005, a final billing credit will be made to customers. The minimum amount of this credit is estimated to be approximately $2.8 million. Oklahoma Natural Gas replaced certain gas contracts, which reduced gas costs by approximately $13.8 million, due to avoided reservation fees between April 2003 and October 2005. Additional savings of approximately $8.0 million from the use of storage gas are expected to occur between November 2003 and March 2005. Any expected savings from the use of storage that are not achieved will be added to the final billing credit scheduled to be provided to customers in December 2005. Oklahoma Natural Gas operating income increased in the second quarter of 2002 by $14.2 million as a result of this settlement. Cash Flow Analysis Operating Cash Flows Operating cash flows increased by $204.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the same period in 2003. The increase in operating cash flows was primarily the result of a net increase in working capital of $513.1 million in 2003 compared to a net increase in working capital of $332.0 million in 2004. These increases primarily related to increases in accounts receivable and gas inventory, partially offset by increases in accounts payable. 49 Table of Contents Working capital changes had the opposite impact on 2003 compared to 2002, contributing to a decrease in operating cash flows of $805.1 million. The high levels of gas in storage at December 31, 2003, including amounts previously classified as energy marketing and risk management assets, resulted in a substantial negative impact on operating cash flows. The impact of higher commodity prices in 2004 and 2003 on accounts receivables, accounts payable and gas inventory negatively impacted operating cash flows. There is typically a lag between when payment is made for gas purchased for our distribution customers and when the customers are billed. This is due to the cycle billing process where distribution customers are billed throughout the month. Under level prices, this lag would have no impact on cash flows from year to year, but with increased prices, as seen in 2004 and 2003, this lag resulted in a negative impact on cash flows. In 2002, the changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable were primarily due to the increase in net energy trading revenues. Our Energy Services segments deposits, or margin requirements, increase or decrease from year to year based on the level of open positions on our contracts as well as commodity prices and price volatility. This change impacts operating cash flows. Investing Cash Flows Acquisitions in 2004 represent the cash purchase of Northern Plains. Increased capital expenditures in 2004 are primarily due to additional drilling by our Production segment. Proceeds from the sale of property include the sales of certain natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines, compression assets, gas distribution systems and investments in 2004. Acquisitions in 2003 primarily represent the cash purchase of our Texas distribution assets and the purchase of gas and oil properties and related flow lines from a partnership owned by Wagner & Brown, Ltd. Cash provided by investing activities of the discontinued component represents the sale of natural gas and oil producing properties for a cash sales price of $294 million, including adjustments, of which $15 million was received in 2002. Proceeds from the sale of property in 2002 include approximately $92 million related to the sale of a portion of our midstream natural gas assets to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation, a private, independent gas and oil company. Proceeds from the sale of equity investments represent the sale of our interest in MHR in 2002. Financing Cash Flows During the first quarter of 2004, we paid off $600 million in notes payable using cash generated from operating activities and proceeds from our February 2004 equity offering. During the second half of 2004, we incurred $644 million of notes payable, which includes the acquisition of Northern Plains and funds used in the ordinary course of business. This resulted in an increase of $44 million in notes payable at December 31, 2004 compared to the previous year end. We terminated $670 million of our interest rate swap agreements in the first quarter of 2004 to lock in savings and generate a positive cash flow of $91.8 million, which included $8.9 million of interest savings previously recognized. These interest rate swaps were previously initiated as a strategy to hedge the fair value of fixed rate long term debt. The proceeds received upon termination of the interest rate swaps, net of amounts previously recognized, will be recognized in the income statement over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged. During the first quarter of 2004, we sold 6.9 million shares of our common stock to an underwriter at $21.93 per share, resulting in proceeds to us, before expenses, of $151.3 million. During the first quarter of 2003, we issued a total of 16.1 million equity units at the public offering price of $25 per unit, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $24.25 per share, or $390.4 million. Each equity unit consists of a stock purchase contract for the purchase of shares of our common stock and, initially, a senior note due February 16, 2008, issued pursuant to an Indenture with SunTrust Bank, as trustee. The equity units carry a total annual coupon rate of 8.5 percent (4.0 percent annual face amount of the senior notes plus 4.5 percent annual contract adjustment payments). The interest expense associated with the 4.0 percent senior notes will be recognized in the income statement on an accrual basis over the term of the senior notes. The present value of the contract adjustment payments was accrued as a liability with a charge to equity at the time of the transactions. Accordingly, there will be no impact on earnings in future periods as this liability is paid, except for the interest recognized as a result of discounting the liability to its present value at the time of the transaction. This interest expense will be approximately $3.5 million over three years. The present value of the contract adjustment payments is accounted for as equity and reduces paid in capital. The number of shares that we will issue for each stock purchase contract issued as part of the equity units will be determined based on our average closing price over the 20 trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to February 16, 2006. If this average closing price: equals or exceeds $20.63, we will issue 1.2119 shares of our common stock for each purchase contract, equals or is less than $17.19, we will issue 1.4543 shares of our common stock for each purchase contract, or 50 Table of Contents is less than $20.63 but greater than $17.19, we will determine the number of shares of our common stock to be issued by multiplying the number of purchase contracts by the ratio of $25 divided by the average closing price. Also, during the first quarter of 2003, we issued a total of 13.8 million shares of common stock at the public offering price of $17.19 per share, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $16.524 per share, or $228 million. In January 2003, we issued common stock and equity units, which were partially offset by the payment of notes payable and the repurchase of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from Westar in February 2003. In August 2003, we repurchased $50 million or approximately 2.6 million shares of our common stock from Westar. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table sets forth our contractual obligations to make future payments under our current debt agreements, operating lease agreements and fixed price contracts. For further discussion of the debt and operating lease agreements, see Notes J and L, respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter (Thousands of dollars) Long term debt $ 1,829,491 $ 341,532 $ 306,547 $ 6,562 $ 409,080 $ 107,624 $ 658,146 Notes payable 644,000 644,000 Operating leases 287,887 47,407 60,371 42,002 39,524 37,051 61,532 Storage contracts 94,669 32,566 25,529 17,647 10,162 6,561 2,204 Firm transportation contracts 420,609 110,219 77,234 60,475 32,519 27,829 112,333 Purchase commitments, rights of way and other 23,513 11,202 3,140 1,937 1,943 1,752 3,539 Pension plan (a) 14,856 1,754 3,356 4,343 3,474 1,929 Other postretirement benefit plan (a) 80,573 16,061 15,917 16,049 16,220 16,326 Total contractual obligations $ 3,395,598 $ 1,204,741 $ 492,094 $ 149,015 $ 512,922 $ 199,072 $ 837,754 (a) No payment amounts are provided for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the Thereafter column since there is no termination date for these plans. Long term debt as reported in the consolidated balance sheets includes unamortized debt discount and the mark to market effect of interest rate swaps. Purchase commitments exclude commodity purchase contracts. The Distribution segment is a party to fixed price transportation contracts. However, the costs associated with these contracts are recovered through rates as allowed by the applicable regulatory agency and are excluded from the table above. Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities The following table sets forth the fair value component of the energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities, excluding derivative instruments that have been declared as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair Value Component of Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities (Thousands of dollars) Net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2003 $ (18,354 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (6,847 ) Fair value of new contracts when entered into during the period 40,188 Other changes in fair value 2,964 Net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2004 $ 17,951 The net fair value of contracts outstanding includes the effect of settled energy contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of market movements on the fair value of energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities. Fair value estimates consider the market in which the transactions are executed. The market in which exchange traded and over the counter transactions are executed is a factor in determining fair value. We utilize third party references for pricing points from NYMEX and third party over the counter brokers to establish the commodity pricing and volatility curves. We believe the reported transactions from these sources are the most reflective of current market prices. Fair values are subject to change based on valuation factors. The estimate of fair value includes an adjustment for the liquidation of the position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market 51 Table of Contents conditions. The fair value estimate also considers the risk of nonperformance based on credit considerations of the counterparty. The net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003 includes energy commodity contracts considered derivatives under Statement 133, including forwards, futures, swaps and options. The following table sets forth the maturity schedule of our energy trading contracts based on the heating season from April through March. This maturity schedule is consistent with our business strategy. Fair Value of Contracts at December 31, 2004 Source of Fair Value (1) Matures through March 2005 Matures through March 2008 Matures through March 2010 Matures after March 2010 Total Fair Value (Thousands of dollars) Prices actively quoted (2) $ 1,580 $ 11,586 $ $ $ 13,166 Prices provided by other external sources (3) 14,550 (14,181 ) (3,703 ) 210 (3,124 ) Prices derived from quotes, other external sources and other assumptions (4) 2,766 2,709 2,331 103 7,909 Total $ 18,896 $ 114 $ (1,372 ) $ 313 $ 17,951 (1) Fair value is the mark to market component of forwards, futures, swaps, and options, net of applicable reserves. These fair values are reflected as a component of assets and liabilities from energy marketing and risk management activities in the consolidated balance sheets. (2) Values are derived from energy market price quotes from national commodity trading exchanges that primarily trade future and option commodity contracts. (3) Values are obtained through energy commodity brokers or electronic trading platforms, whose primary service is to match willing buyers and sellers of energy commodities. Because of the large energy broker network, energy price information by location is readily available. (4) Values derived in this category utilize market price information from the other two categories, as well as other assumptions for liquidity and credit. The following table sets forth our Energy Services segments financial and commodity risk from fixed price transactions at December 31, 2004. Investment Grade Credit Quality (1) Below Investment Grade Credit Quality (Thousands of dollars) Gas and electric utilities $ 14,423 $ (11,402 ) Financial institutions 6,766 Oil and gas producers (7,983 ) 7,073 Industrial and commercial (24,050 ) 1,490 Other (6,185 ) (1,270 ) Net value of fixed price transactions $ (17,029 ) $ (4,109 ) (1) Investment grade is primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings along with consideration of cash prepayments, cash managing, standby letters of credit and parent company guarantees. Included in Investment Grade are counterparties with a minimum Standard and Poors or Moodys rating of BBB or Baa3, respectively. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement 123R. Statement 123R requires companies to expense the fair value of share based payments. In addition, there are also changes related to the share based payment expense calculation. Statement 123R is effective for the interim period beginning after June 15, 2005. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting Statement 123R, but we do not believe it will have a material impact on our condition and results of operations since we have been expensing share based payments since the adoption of Statement 148 on January 1, 2003. 52 Table of Contents In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R) that addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities. We adopted FIN 46R in the first quarter of 2004. FIN 46R had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for 2004. The EITF is currently deliberating EITF Issue No. 04 5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights (EITF 04 5). Since the changes proposed in EITF 04 5 would result in different guidance in accounting for general partners that are in different industries, the FASB Staff is planning to amend SOP 78 9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures to be consistent with EITF 04 5. SOP 78 9 a, Interaction of AICPA Statement of Position 78 9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures, and EITF Issue No. 04 5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership When the Investor Is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights (SOP 78 9 a) will have the presumption that a general partner controls a limited partnership and therefore should consolidate the partnership. This presumption can be overcome if the limited partners have kick out or substantive participating rights. We could be required to consolidate Northern Border Partners; however we will begin to evaluate the impact and transition method if or when SOP 78 9 a and EITF 04 5 are finalized. The anticipated effective date of SOP 78 9 a and EITF 04 5 is January 1, 2006. Other Environmental We are subject to multiple environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid wastes and hazardous material and substance management. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines, penalties and or interruptions in our operations that could be material to our results of operations. If an accidental leak or spill of hazardous materials occurs from our lines or facilities, in the process of transporting natural gas or NGLs, or at any facility that we own, operate or otherwise use, we could be held jointly and severally liable for all resulting liabilities, including investigation and clean up costs, which could materially affect our results, operations and cash flow. In addition, emission controls required under the Federal Clean Air Act and other similar federal and state laws could require unexpected capital expenditures at our facilities. We cannot assure you that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We own or retain legal responsibility for the environmental conditions at 12 former manufactured gas sites in Kansas. These sites contain potentially harmful materials that are subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. A consent agreement with the KDHE presently governs all work at these sites. The terms of the consent agreement allow us to investigate these sites and set remediation activities based upon the results of the investigations and risk analysis. We have commenced active remediation on six sites with regulatory closure achieved at two of these locations, and have begun assessments at the remaining sites. The site situations are not similar and we have no previous experience with similar remediation efforts. We have completed some analysis of the remaining six sites, but are unable to accurately estimate individual or aggregate costs that may be required to satisfy our remedial obligations. Our preliminary review of similar cleanup efforts at former manufactured gas sites reveals that costs can range from $100,000 to $10 million per site. These estimates do not give effect to potential insurance recoveries, recoveries through rates or from unaffiliated parties, to which we may be entitled. At this time, we have not recorded any amounts for potential insurance recoveries or recoveries from unaffiliated parties, and we are not recovering any environmental amounts in rates. Total costs to remediate the two sites, which have achieved regulatory closure, was approximately $700,000. Total remedial costs for each of the remaining sites are expected to exceed $500,000 per site, but there is no assurance that costs to investigate and remediate the remaining sites will not be significantly higher. As more information related to the site investigations and remediation activities becomes available, and to the extent such amounts are expected to exceed our current estimates, additional expenses could be recorded. Such amounts could be material to our results of operations and cash flows depending on the remediation done and number of years over which the remediation is completed. Our expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation to date have not been significant in relation to the results of operations and there were no material effects upon earnings during 2004 related to compliance with environmental regulations. Yaggy Facility In January 2001, the Yaggy gas storage facilitys operating parameters were changed as mandated by the KDHE following natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers in or near Hutchison, Kansas. In July 2002, the KDHE issued an administrative order that assessed a civil penalty against us, based on alleged violations of several KDHE 53 Table of Contents regulations. On April 5, 2004, we entered into a Consent Order with the KDHE in which we paid a civil penalty in the amount of $180,000 and reimbursed the KDHE for its costs related to the investigation of the incident in the amount of approximately $79,000. In addition, the Consent Order requires us to conduct an environmental remediation and a geoengineering study. Based on information currently available to us, we do not believe there are any material adverse effects resulting from the Consent Order. In February 2004, a jury awarded the plaintiffs in a lawsuit involving property damage alleged to relate to the gas explosions and eruptions, $1.7 million in actual damages. In April 2004, the judge in this case awarded punitive damages in the amount of $5.25 million. We have filed an appeal of the jury verdict and the punitive damage award. Based on information currently available to us, we believe our legal reserves and insurance coverage is adequate and that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on us. The two class action lawsuits filed against us in connection with the natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers that occurred at, and in the vicinity of, the Yaggy facility in January 2001 resulted in jury verdicts in September 2004. The jury awarded the plaintiffs in the residential class $5 million in actual damages, which is covered by insurance. In the other class action relating to business claims, the jury awarded no actual damages. The jury rejected claims for punitive damages in both cases. We are reviewing our options for appealing the verdict rendered in the residential claimants class action. With the exception of appeals, all litigation regarding the Yaggy facility has been resolved. Enron We have repurchased a portion of the Enron Corp. guaranty claim that Enron Corp. and ENA sought to avoid in the adversary proceeding. We are now providing the defense of the adversary proceeding for both the portion of the guaranty claim constituting the repurchased claim and also the portion of the guaranty claim previously sold. Based on information currently available to us, we do not expect the adversary proceeding to have a material adverse effect on us. In addition to the adversary proceeding, Enron Corp. and ENA have filed a new objection to portions of the guaranty claim and to portions of the underlying claim against ENA, creating a new contested matter in the Enron Corp. and ENA bankruptcy cases which involve different legal and factual issues than those raised in the adversary proceeding. Enron Corp. and ENA allege in this matter that the guaranty claim and underlying claim against ENA are overstated. The filing of this matter may trigger additional obligations for us to repurchase some of the claims previously sold. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on us. Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors Some of the statements contained and incorporated in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward looking statements relate to the anticipated financial performance, managements plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory and legal proceedings, market conditions and other matters. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements in various circumstances.

Forward looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, the information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and other statements contained or incorporated in this Form 10 K generally identified by words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, intend, believe, projection or goal. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements. Known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by forward looking statements. Those factors may affect our operations, markets, products, services and prices. In addition to any assumptions, risks and other factors referred to specifically in connection with forward looking statements, factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward looking statement include, among others: risks associated with any reduction in our credit ratings, the effects of weather and other natural phenomena on energy sales and prices, competition from other energy suppliers as well as alternative forms of energy, the capital intensive nature of our business, further deregulation of the natural gas business, 54 Table of Contents competitive changes in the natural gas gathering, transportation and storage business resulting from deregulation of the natural gas business, the profitability of assets or businesses acquired by us, risks of marketing, trading and hedging activities as a result of changes in energy prices or the financial condition of our counterparties, economic climate and growth in the geographic areas in which we do business, the uncertainty of estimates, including accruals, cost of environmental remediation, and gas and oil reserves, the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for natural gas, NGLs, electricity and crude oil, the effects of changes in governmental policies and regulatory actions, including, changes with respect to income taxes, environmental compliance, and authorized rates or recovery of gas costs, the impact of recently issued and future accounting pronouncements and other changes in accounting policies, the possibility of future terrorist attacks or the possibility or occurrence of an outbreak of, or changes in, hostilities or changes in the political dynamics in the Middle East and elsewhere, the risk of increased costs for insurance premiums, security or other items as a consequence of terrorist attacks, the impact of unforeseen changes in interest rates, equity markets, inflation rates, economic recession and other external factors over which we have no control, including the effect on pension expense and funding resulting from changes in stock and bond market returns, risks associated with pending or possible acquisitions and dispositions, including our ability to finance or integrate any such acquisitions and any regulatory delay or conditions imposed by regulatory bodies in connection with any such acquisitions and dispositions, the results of administrative proceedings and litigation involving the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, Kansas Corporation Commission, Texas regulatory authorities or any other local, state or federal regulatory body, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, our ability to access capital at competitive rates on terms acceptable to us, the risk of a significant slowdown in growth or decline in the U.S. economy or the risk of delay in growth or recovery in the U.S. economy, risks associated with the adequate supply of natural gas to our gathering and processing facilities, including production declines which outpace new drilling, risks inherent in the implementation of new software, such as our customer service system, and the impact on the timeliness of information for financial reporting, the risk that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting could emerge or that minor problems could become significant, the impact of the outcome of pending and future litigation, and the other factors listed in the reports we have filed and may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are incorporated by reference. Other factors and assumptions not identified above were also involved in the making of the forward looking statements. The failure of those assumptions to be realized, as well as other factors, may also cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. We have no obligation and make no undertaking to update publicly or revise any forward looking statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Commodity Price Risk Non Regulated Businesses, Including Energy Services We are exposed to market risk and the impact of market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and power prices. Market risk refers to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in commodity energy prices. Our primary exposure arises from fixed price purchase or sale agreements that extend for periods of up to five years, gas in storage utilized by the Energy Services segment, NGLs in storage utilized by ONEOK NGL Marketing, the difference in price between natural gas and NGL prices with respect to our keep whole processing agreements, and anticipated sales of natural gas and oil production. To a lesser extent, we are exposed to the risk of changing prices or the cost of intervening transportation resulting from purchasing gas at one location and selling it at another (referred to as basis risk). To minimize the risk from market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, we use commodity derivative instruments such as futures contracts, swaps and options to manage market risk of existing or anticipated purchase and sale agreements, existing physical gas in storage, and basis risk. We adhere to policies and procedures that limit our exposure to market risk from open positions and that monitor our market risk exposure. 55 Table of Contents For a detail of the Energy Services segments maturity of energy trading contracts based on heating injection and withdrawal periods from April through March and the related models and assumptions, refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. For further discussion of trading activities, see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation on this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Also, see Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Regulated Businesses Kansas Gas Service uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of anticipated gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect Kansas Gas Service customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural gas. At December 31, 2004, Kansas Gas Service had derivative instruments in place to hedge the cost of natural gas purchases for 4.4 Bcf, representing part of their gas purchase requirements for the 2004/2005 winter heating months. Gains or losses associated with the Kansas Gas Service hedges are included in and recoverable through the monthly PGA. From time to time, Texas Gas Service uses derivative instruments to mitigate the volatility of the cost of gas to protect its customers in the city of El Paso. At December 31, 2004, Texas Gas Service had no derivative instruments in place to hedge the cost of natural gas purchases. Gains or losses associated with the derivative instruments would be included in and recoverable through the monthly PGA. Value at Risk (VAR) Disclosure of Market Risk We measure market risk in the energy marketing and risk management, trading and non trading portfolios of our non regulated businesses using a VAR methodology, which estimates the expected maximum loss of the portfolio over a specified time horizon within a given confidence interval. Our VAR calculations are based on the Monte Carlo approach. The quantification of market risk using VAR provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance, to determine risk targets and set position limits. The use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions, including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation. Inputs to the calculation include prices, positions, instrument valuations and the variance covariance matrix. Historical data is used to estimate our VAR with more weight given to recent data, which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements. We rely on VAR to determine the potential reduction in the portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period. While management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable, no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating VAR. Different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different VAR estimates. Our VAR exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized for our non regulated businesses energy marketing and risk management, non trading and trading portfolios of derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and gas in storage due to adverse market movements. A one day time horizon and a 95 percent confidence level were used in our VAR data. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the VAR calculation based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices, operating exposures and timing thereof, and the changes in our derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and gas in storage. VAR information should be evaluated in light of these assumptions and the methodologys other limitations. The potential impact on our future earnings, as measured by the VAR, was $9.6 million and $11.0 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The following table details the average, high and low VAR calculations. Years Ended December 31, Value at Risk 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Average $ 3.8 $ 3.9 High $ 17.7 $ 17.1 Low $ 0.6 $ 0.5 The variations in the VAR data are reflective of market volatility and changes in the portfolios during the year. Risk Policy and Oversight We control the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. The audit committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibilities for our risk management limits and policies. A risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price, credit and interest rate risk management, and marketing and trading activities. The committee also proposes risk metrics including VAR and position 56 Table of Contents loss limits. We have a corporate risk control organization led by our Senior Vice President of Financial Services and Treasurer and the Vice President of Audit Services and Risk Control, who are assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies, procedures and limits. Key risk control activities include credit review and approval, credit and performance risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics. To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably. As a result, we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position. Interest Rate and Currency Risk Interest Rate Risk We are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the normal course of business. We manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates. At December 31, 2004, the interest rate on 59.4 percent of our debt was fixed, after considering the effect of interest rate swaps. During the first quarter of 2004, we terminated $670 million of our interest rate swap agreements to lock in savings and received $91.8 million, which includes $8.9 million of interest rate savings previously recorded. These interest rate swaps were previously initiated as a strategy to hedge the fair value of fixed rate, long term debt. The net proceeds received upon termination of the interest rate swaps were $81.9 million, after reduction for ineffectiveness and unpaid interest. Ineffectiveness related to these hedges of approximately $1.0 million is included in interest expense. Through December 31, 2004, $8.1 million in interest expense savings has been recognized and the remaining amount of $73.8 million will be recognized in the income statement over the remaining term of the debt instruments originally hedged. Consequently, the remaining savings in interest expense will be recognized over the following periods: 2005 $ 10.0 million 2006 $ 10.0 million 2007 $ 10.0 million 2008 $ 10.0 million Thereafter $ 33.8 million We entered into new swap agreements to replace the terminated agreements. Currently, $740 million of fixed rate debt is swapped to floating. The floating rate debt is based on both the three and six month London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), depending upon the swap. Based on the current LIBOR strip, the weighted average rate on the $740 million of debt will be reduced from 6.81 percent to 4.54 percent. This, along with the amortization of the terminated swaps, will result in an estimated savings of $16.8 million during 2005. The swaps and amortization resulted in approximately $24.4 million in savings in 2003 and $27.6 million in savings during 2004. At December 31, 2004, we had a net liability of $17.6 million recorded in energy marketing and risk management liabilities to reflect the fair value of the current interest rate swaps. Long term debt reflects the offset to the fair value of the swaps, with a decrease in overall debt of $17.6 million. At December 31, 2004, a 100 basis point move in the annual interest rate on all of our outstanding long term debt would change our annual interest expense by $7.4 million before taxes. This 100 basis point change assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. If interest rates changed significantly, we would take actions to manage our exposure to the change. Since a specific action and the possible effects are uncertain, no change has been assumed. Currency Rate Risk With our Energy Services segments expansion into Canada, we are subject to currency exposure related to our firm transportation and storage contracts. Our objective with respect to currency risk is to reduce the exposure due to exchange rate fluctuations. We use physical forward transactions, which result in an actual two way flow of currency on the settlement date since we exchange U.S. dollars for Canadian dollars with another party. The notional amounts in the physical forward transactions approximate the timing and payment amounts related to our firm transportation and storage contracts. We have not designated these transactions for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, the gains and losses associated with the change in fair value are recorded in operating income. At December 31, 2004, our exposure to risk from currency translation was not material. 57 Table of Contents
