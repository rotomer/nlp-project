ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The following discussion highlights some of our achievements and significant issues affecting us this past year. You should read the Financial and Operating Results section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and the Financial Statements for a complete explanation of the following items. Our diluted earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations increased to $3.73 in 2005 compared with $2.13 in 2004. During 2005, we increased our dividend to a current annual dividend of $1.12 per share of common stock. This follows four increases in our dividend during 2004. In 2005, our income from continuing operations increased to $403.1 million from $224.7 million in 2004, a 79 percent increase. Operating income increased to $799.0 million in 2005 from $443.7 million in 2004, primarily due to the gain on sale of assets in our Gathering and Processing segment of $264.2 million. Our Energy Services segment benefited from increases in natural gas prices and price volatility during 2005. Operating income for our Energy Services segment increased $26.5 million in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily due to an increase of $32.4 million in net margin. An increase of $41.9 million in net margin was due to the effect of improved natural gas basis differentials on transportation margins. A $22.6 million increase in net margin was due to the increase in wholesale physical marketing margins, which resulted from natural gas price volatility. These increases were partially offset by an $18.3 million decrease in storage margins from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness primarily related to natural gas basis movements attributable to anticipated storage withdrawals from the 2006/2007 heating season and an $18.4 million decrease resulting from less favorable price movements in 2005 related to our natural gas fixed price activities. Favorable energy prices also had a significant impact on our Gathering and Processing segments results during 2005. Average prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil exceeded prices for the same period in 2004. The gross processing spread was also higher in 2005 and continued to exceed the previous five year and three year averages. The acquisition of the natural gas liquids businesses owned by several affiliates and a subsidiary of Koch in July 2005, accounted for increases in both our Natural Gas Liquids segment and our Pipelines and Storage segment. On February 14, 2006, we signed agreements to sell certain assets to Northern Border Partners for approximately $3 billion in cash and limited partner units and increase our general partnership interest in Northern Border Partners to 100 percent. We expect these transactions to be completed by April 1, 2006. These transactions will result in our Gathering and Processing segment, Natural Gas Liquids segment, and Pipelines and Storage segment being transferred to Northern Border Partners. On October 4, 2005, the OCC issued a final order on our application for a rate increase by Oklahoma Natural Gas. The OCC unanimously approved an annual rate increase of $57.5 million. The Commissions administrative law judge had previously 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements recommended an increase in annual revenues of approximately $58.0 million in July 2005. Oklahoma Natural Gas implemented new rates, subject to refund, on July 28, 2005, based on the judges report. SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES In February 2006, we signed agreements to sell certain assets to Northern Border Partners for approximately $3 billion in cash and limited partner units and increase our general partner interest in Northern Border Partners to 100 percent. We will purchase, through Northern Plains, from an affiliate of TransCanada Corporation (TransCanada) 17.5 percent of the general partner interest in Northern Border Partners for $40 million, less $10 million for expenses associated with the transfer of operating responsibility of the Northern Border Pipeline Company to TransCanada for a net payment of $30 million. After the transactions are completed, we will own approximately 37.0 million limited partner units and 100 percent of the Northern Border Partners general partner interest, increasing our total interest in Northern Border Partners to 45.7 percent. With the purchase of 17.5 percent of the general partner interest in Northern Border Partners, we will also transfer our Gathering and Processing segment, Natural Gas Liquids segment, and Pipelines and Storage segment to Northern Border Partners in transactions valued at approximately $3 billion. We will receive approximately $1.35 billion in cash and approximately 36.5 million limited partner units from Northern Border Partners. The limited partner units and related general partner interest contribution were valued at approximately $1.65 billion at the time of the signing of the transaction. This sale, subject to adjustment, includes the natural gas liquids assets we purchased from Koch in July 2005 for $1.35 billion. We will not recognize a gain on the sale as the transfer of assets will be accounted for at the assets historical cost. We plan to use the cash proceeds to reduce short term debt, acquire other assets or repurchase our common stock. These transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, including antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart Scott Rodino Act. We expect these transactions to be completed by April 1, 2006. In December 2005, we sold our natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas to a subsidiary of Eagle Rock Energy, Inc. for approximately $527.2 million and recorded a pre tax gain of $264.2 million, which is included in gain on sale of assets in our Gathering and Processing segments operating income. The gain reflects the cash received less adjustments, selling expenses and the net book value of the assets sold. We used the net cash proceeds from this sale to prepay our 7.75 percent $300.0 million long term debt which was due in August 2006. In October 2005, we entered into an agreement to sell our Spring Creek power plant to Westar for $53 million. The transaction requires FERC approval and is expected to be completed in 2006. The 300 megawatt gas fired merchant power plant was built in 2001 to supply electrical power during peak periods using gas powered turbine generators. The financial information related to the properties sold is reflected as a discontinued component in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All periods presented have been restated to reflect the discontinued component. In September 2005, we completed the sale of our Production segment to TXOK Acquisition, Inc. for $645 million, before adjustments and recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately $240.3 million. The gain reflects the cash received less adjustments, selling expenses and the net book value of the assets sold. The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce debt. The financial information related to the properties sold is reflected as a discontinued component in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All periods presented have been restated to reflect the discontinued component. In July 2005, we completed the acquisition of the natural gas liquids businesses owned by Koch for approximately $1.33 billion, net of working capital and cash received. This transaction included Koch Hydrocarbon, LPs entire mid continent natural gas liquids fractionation business; Koch Pipeline Company, LPs natural gas liquids pipeline distribution systems; Chisholm Pipeline Holdings, Inc., which has a 50 percent ownership interest in Chisholm Pipeline Company; MBFF, LP, which owns an 80 percent interest in a 160,000 barrel per day fractionator at Mont Belvieu, Texas; and Koch Vesco Holdings, LLC, an entity that owns a 10.2 percent interest in VESCO. These assets are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on July 1, 2005. In November 2004, we acquired Northern Plains, which owns 82.5 percent of the general partner interest and 500,000 limited partnership units, together representing a 2.73 percent ownership interest, in Northern Border Partners, from CCE Holdings, LLC for $175 million. Income derived from this investment is included in other income in our Other segment. In December 2003, we acquired approximately $240 million of natural gas and crude oil properties and related flow lines located in Texas. The results of operations for these assets were included in our consolidated financial statements from that date until the disposition of our Production segment in September 2005. 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In January 2003, we sold approximately 70 percent of the natural gas and crude oil producing properties of our Production segment for an adjusted cash price of $294 million. The properties sold were located in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. We recorded a pretax gain of approximately $61.2 million in 2003 related to this sale. The financial information related to the properties sold is reflected as a discontinued component in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In January 2003, we acquired the Texas natural gas distribution business and other assets from Southern Union Company. The results of operations for these assets have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. We paid approximately $436.6 million for these assets, including $16.6 million in working capital adjustments. The primary assets acquired were natural gas distribution operations that currently serve approximately 560,000 customers in cities located throughout Texas, including the major cities of El Paso and Austin, as well as the cities of Port Arthur, Galveston, Brownsville and others. Over 90 percent of the customers are residential. The other assets acquired include a 125 mile natural gas transmission system, as well as other energy related domestic assets involved in natural gas marketing, retail sales of propane and distribution of propane. The purchase also included natural gas distribution investments in Mexico. The assets relating to the propane distribution operations were sold in May and July 2004, and the natural gas distribution investments in Mexico were sold in May 2004. REGULATORY Several regulatory initiatives positively impacted the earnings and future earnings potential for our Distribution segment. These are discussed beginning on page 42. IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment (Statement 123R). Statement 123R requires companies to expense the fair value of share based payments. In addition, there are also changes related to the expense calculation for share based payments. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement 123R, and we elected to use the prospective method. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting Statement 123R, but we do not believe it will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as we have been expensing share based payments since our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure on January 1, 2003. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), that requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 is effective for our year ended December 31, 2005. We completed our review of the applicability of FIN 47 to our operations and determined that its impact was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in EITF 04 5. EITF 04 5 presumes that a general partner controls a limited partnership and therefore should consolidate the partnership in the financial statements of the general partner. Effective January 1, 2006, we were required to consolidate Northern Border Partners operations in our consolidated financial statements and we elected to use the prospective method. If we had consolidated Northern Border Partners at December 31, 2005, our debt to equity ratio would have changed from 67 percent debt and 33 percent equity to 73 percent debt and 27 percent equity. This increase results from the consolidation of Northern Border Partners debt of $1.35 billion at December 31, 2005, while the majority of their equity is reported as minority interest liability. The debt covenant calculations in our credit agreements exclude the debt of Northern Border Partners, since it is a master limited partnership. The adoption of EITF 04 5 will not have an impact on our net income; however, reported revenues, costs and expenses will be higher to reflect the activities of Northern Border Partners. In September 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in EITF Issue No. 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty (EITF 04 13). EITF 04 13 defines when a purchase and a sale of inventory with the same party that operates in the same line of business should be considered a single nonmonetary transaction. EITF 04 13 is effective for new arrangements that a company enters into in periods beginning after March 15, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of EITF 04 13 to impact our consolidated financial statements. The FASB is currently reviewing the accounting for pension and postretirement medical benefits and expects to issue an exposure draft on phase one of this project during the first quarter of 2006. The final standard for the first phase of this project is expected to be issued in the third quarter of 2006 with implementation required for years ending after December 15, 2006. Based on the FASBs discussion, we could be required to record a balance sheet liability equal to the difference between our benefit obligations and plan assets. If this requirement had been in place at December 31, 2005, we would have 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements been required to record unrecognized losses of $124.8 million and $78.8 million for pension and postretirement benefits, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Certain amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosure must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. Therefore, the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. The following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies, which are defined as those policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring managements most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters. We have discussed the development of and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. Derivatives and Risk Management Activities We engage in wholesale energy marketing, retail marketing, trading, and risk management activities. We account for derivative instruments utilized in connection with these activities and services under the fair value basis of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (Statement 133), as amended. Under Statement 133, entities are required to record derivative instruments at fair value. The fair value of derivative instruments is determined by commodity exchange prices, over the counter quotes, volatility, time value, counterparty credit and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions. Refer to the table on page 53 for amounts in our portfolio at December 31, 2005, that were determined by prices actively quoted, prices provided by other external sources and prices derived from other sources. The majority of our portfolios fair values are based on actual market prices. Transactions are also executed in markets for which market prices may exist but the market may be relatively inactive, thereby resulting in limited price transparency that requires managements subjectivity in estimating fair values. Market value changes result in a change in the fair value of our derivative instruments. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the reason for holding it. If the derivative instrument does not qualify or is not designated as part of a hedging relationship, we account for changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings as they occur. Commodity price volatility may have a significant impact on the gain or loss in any given period. For more information on fair value sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. To minimize the risk of fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices, we periodically enter into futures transactions and swaps in order to hedge anticipated purchases of natural gas and crude oil, fuel requirements and NGL inventories. Interest rate swaps are also used to manage interest rate risk. Under certain conditions, we designate these derivative instruments as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values or cash flows. For hedges of exposure to changes in fair value, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. For hedges of exposure to changes in cash flow, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness of designated hedges is reported in earnings in the period the ineffectiveness occurs. Many of our purchase and sale agreements that otherwise would be required to follow derivative accounting qualify as normal purchases and normal sales under Statement 133 and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment. Energy related contracts that are not derivatives pursuant to Statement 133 are no longer carried at fair value but are accounted for on an accrual basis as executory contracts. Changes to the accounting for existing contracts as a result of the rescission of EITF Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities were reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. This resulted in a cumulative effect loss, net of tax, of $141.8 million in 2003. 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impairment of Goodwill and Long Lived Assets We assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (Statement 142). An initial assessment is made by comparing the fair value of the operations with goodwill, as determined in accordance with Statement 142, to the book value of each reporting unit. If the fair value is less than the book value, an impairment is indicated, and we must perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment. In the second test, we calculate the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the operations with goodwill from the fair value determined in step one of the assessment. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds this calculated implied fair value of the goodwill, we will record an impairment charge. At December 31, 2005, we had the following amounts of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. (Thousands of dollars) Gathering and Processing $ 15,604 Natural Gas Liquids 173,945 Pipelines and Storage 22,036 Energy Services 10,255 Distribution 158,554 Total goodwill $ 380,394 We assess our long lived assets for impairment based on Statement 144. A long lived asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may exceed its fair value. Fair values are based on the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. Examples of long lived asset impairment indicators include: a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator that would exclude allowable costs from the rate making process, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset or asset group, a current period operating cash flow loss, combined with a history of operating cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group, and a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. In the third quarter of 2005, we made the decision to sell our Spring Creek power plant, located in central Oklahoma, and exit the power generation business. In October 2005, we concluded that our Spring Creek power plant had been impaired and recorded an impairment expense of $52.2 million. This conclusion was based on our Statement 144 impairment analysis of the results of operations for this plant through September 30, 2005, and also the net sales proceeds from the anticipated sale of the plant. These assets were held for sale at December 31, 2005, and, accordingly, this component of our business is accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with Statement 144. Pension and Postretirement Employee Benefits We have a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all full time employees and a postretirement employee benefits plan covering most employees. Nonbargaining unit employees hired after December 31, 2004, are not eligible for our defined benefit pension plan; however, they are covered by a profit sharing plan. Nonbargaining unit employees retiring between the ages of 50 and 55 who elect postretirement medical coverage, all nonbargaining unit employees hired on or after January 1, 1999, employees who are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers hired after June 30, 2003, and gas union employees hired after July 1, 2004, who elect postretirement medical coverage pay 100 percent of the retiree premium for participation in the plan. Additionally, any employees who came to us through various acquisitions may be further limited in their eligibility to participate or receive any contributions from us for postretirement medical benefits. Our actuarial consultant calculates the expense and liability related to these plans and uses statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, age and employment periods. In determining the projected benefit obligations and costs, assumptions can change from period to period and result in material changes in the costs and liabilities we recognize. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information. 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for our health care plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects. One PercentagePoint Increase One PercentagePoint Decrease (Thousands of dollars) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 3,106 $ (2,513 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 17,982 $ (15,619 ) During 2005, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $13.0 million related to our defined benefit pension plans and $27.4 million related to postretirement benefits. We estimate that in 2006, we will record net periodic benefit costs of $21.9 million related to our defined benefit pension plan and $25.9 million related to postretirement benefits. In determining our estimated expenses for 2006, our actuarial consultant assumed an 8.75 percent expected return on plan assets and a discount rate of 5.75 percent. A decrease in our expected return on plan assets to 8.50 percent would increase our 2006 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $1.6 million for our defined benefit pension plan and would not have a significant impact on our postretirement benefit plan. A decrease in our assumed discount rate to 5.25 percent would increase our 2006 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $4.9 million for our defined benefit pension plan and $1.6 million for our postretirement benefit plan. For 2006, we anticipate our total contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and postretirement benefit plan to be $1.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively, and our pay as you go other postretirement benefit plan costs to be $14.0 million. Contingencies Our accounting for contingencies covers a variety of business activities including contingencies for legal exposures and environmental exposures. We accrue these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We base our estimates on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution. Actual results may differ from our estimates resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on earnings. FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS Consolidated Operations The following table sets forth certain selected financial information for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2005 2004 2003 (Thousands of dollars) Operating revenues, excluding energy trading revenues $ 12,663,550 $ 5,671,714 $ 2,640,684 Energy trading revenues, net 12,680 113,814 229,782 Cost of sales and fuel 11,338,076 4,648,311 1,785,648 Net margin 1,338,154 1,137,217 1,084,818 Operating costs 619,995 535,512 512,268 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 183,394 158,053 144,695 Gain on sale of assets 264,207 Operating income $ 798,972 $ 443,652 $ 427,855 Other income $ 14,188 $ 17,599 $ 8,128 Other expense $ 19,883 $ 12,056 $ 5,198 Discontinued operations, net of taxes Income (loss) from operations of discontinued components, net $ (6,180 ) $ 17,505 $ 10,185 Gain on sale of discontinued component, net $ 149,577 $ $ 39,739 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, net of tax $ $ $ (143,885 ) 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Results Net margin increased for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the same period in 2004 primarily due to: the effect of increased natural gas basis differentials and natural gas price volatility in our Energy Services segment, the impact of favorable commodity pricing for natural gas and NGL products on our Gathering and Processing segment, the effect of the natural gas liquids assets acquired from Koch in our Natural Gas Liquids segment and our Pipelines and Storage segment, and the implementation of new rate schedules in Oklahoma for our Distribution segment. For an explanation of energy trading revenues, net, see the discussion of our Energy Services segment beginning on page 37. Consolidated operating costs for the year increased primarily because of costs related to the natural gas liquids assets acquired from Koch and increased employee benefit costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased for the year primarily due to the costs associated with the natural gas liquids assets acquired from Koch. Further increases resulted from additional plant, property and equipment in our Distribution segment and regulatory asset amortization resulting from the Kansas Gas Service rate case. Operating income for 2005 includes the gain on sale of assets in our Gathering and Processing segment of $264.2 million. This gain was the result of the sale of certain natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas to a subsidiary of Eagle Rock Energy, Inc. in December 2005. Net margin increased in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to: the impact of favorable commodity pricing for natural gas and NGL products on our Gathering and Processing segment, and the implementation of new rate schedules in Kansas and Oklahoma for our Distribution Segment. These increases in net margin in 2004 compared with 2003 were partially offset by the impact of reduced volatility in natural gas prices and lower inter regional basis spreads from marketing and seasonal gas sales from storage for our Energy Services segment. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization increased in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to: increased employee benefit costs, and regulatory asset amortization resulting from the Oklahoma and Kansas rate cases. The following table sets forth the components of other income for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (Thousands of dollars) Equity income $ 2,538 $ 2,404 $ 1,489 Gains on sale of assets 5,651 11,269 292 Interest income 2,686 1,282 2,944 Income from benefit plan investments 2,027 1,671 2,559 Other 1,286 973 844 Other Income $ 14,188 $ 17,599 $ 8,128 In November 2004, we acquired Northern Plains, which owns 82.5 percent of the general partnership interest and 500,000 limited partnership units, together representing a 2.73 percent ownership interest, in Northern Border Partners. Our equity income includes $10.1 million and $1.3 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, from Northern Border Partners. The decrease in other income for 2005 is primarily due to the impairment of $5.9 million, included in equity income, recognized in the fourth quarter of 2005 on our 50 percent investment in an Oklahoma gas plant which we do not operate. Also affecting 2005 other income is a $2.6 million impairment charge, included in equity income, related to one of our gas gathering partnerships that may terminate in early 2006. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table sets forth the components of other expense for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (Thousands of dollars) Donations and civic contributions $ 12,236 $ 2,078 $ 5,973 Non operating litigation expense and claims, net 4,690 7,033 (2,506 ) Loss on sale of property 818 683 6 Terminated acquisition expense 551 401 175 Other 1,588 1,861 1,550 Other Expense $ 19,883 $ 12,056 $ 5,198 Other expense increased in 2005, primarily due to our $10.0 million donation to the ONEOK Foundation, included in donations and civic contributions. More information regarding our results of operations is provided in the discussion of each segments results. The discontinued component is discussed in our Discontinued Operations and Energy Services segment sections and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is discussed in our Energy Services segment section. Key Performance Indicators Key performance indicators reviewed by management include: earnings per share, return on invested capital, and shareholder appreciation. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.01 and $3.73, respectively, representing an 81 percent increase in basic earnings per share and a 75 percent increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared with 2004. Return on invested capital is 23.0 percent in 2005 compared with 14.3 percent in 2004. To evaluate shareholder appreciation, we compare ourselves with a group of 20 peer companies. For the three years ended December 31, 2005, we ranked in the top 50th percentile in shareholder appreciation compared to our peers. Gathering and Processing Overview Our Gathering and Processing segment is engaged in the gathering and processing of natural gas and fractionation of NGLs primarily in Oklahoma and Kansas. Our operations include the gathering of natural gas production from crude oil and natural gas wells. Through gathering systems, these volumes are aggregated for removal of water vapor, solids and other contaminants and to extract NGLs in order to provide marketable natural gas, commonly referred to as residue gas. When the liquids are separated from the raw natural gas at the processing plants, the liquids are generally in the form of a mixed NGL stream. This stream can then be separated by a distillation process, referred to as fractionation, into marketable product components such as ethane, propane, iso butane, normal butane and natural gasoline. The component products can then be stored, transported and marketed to a diverse customer base of end users. Acquisition and Divestiture The following acquisition and divestiture are described beginning on page 25. In December 2005, we sold our natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas. This sale included approximately 3,700 miles of pipe and six processing plants with a capacity of 0.2 Bcf/d. See page 25 for additional information. The impact of these assets on our Gathering and Processing segments operating income for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $42.0 million. In July 2005, we acquired Koch Vesco Holdings, LLC, an entity which owns a 10.2 percent interest in VESCO. VESCO owns a gas processing complex near Venice, Louisiana. 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for our Gathering and Processing segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2005 2004 2003 (Thousands of dollars) Natural gas liquids and condensate sales $ 671,865 $ 575,537 $ 449,294 Gas sales 877,049 669,956 640,499 Gathering, compression, dehydration and processing fees and other revenues 99,660 93,491 91,259 Cost of sales and fuel 1,361,308 1,071,954 982,753 Net margin 287,266 267,030 198,299 Operating costs 123,385 118,090 112,822 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 32,649 32,744 29,273 Gain on sale of assets 264,207 Operating income $ 395,439 $ 116,196 $ 56,204 Other income (expense), net $ (7,373 ) $ 486 $ (108 ) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ $ $ (1,375 ) Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2005 2004 2003 Total gas gathered (MMMBtu/d) 1,077 1,099 1,171 Total gas processed (MMMBtu/d) 1,117 1,172 1,209 Natural gas liquids sales (MBbls/d) 49 51 49 Natural gas liquids produced (MBbls/d) 59 62 59 Gas sales (MMMBtu/d) 329 328 330 Capital expenditures (Thousands of dollars) $ 28,316 $ 23,067 $ 20,444 Average Conway OPIS composite NGL price ($/gal) (based on our NGL product mix) $ 0.89 $ 0.72 $ 0.59 Average NYMEX crude oil price ($/Bbl) $ 55.76 $ 41.34 $ 30.98 Average realized condensate price ($/Bbl) $ 52.69 $ 38.17 $ 28.68 Average natural gas price ($/MMBtu) (mid continent region) $ 7.30 $ 5.54 $ 5.06 Gross processing spread ($/MMBtu) $ 2.77 $ 2.47 $ 1.36 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Keep whole: NGL shrink (MMBtu/d) 61,558 80,700 Plant fuel (MMBtu/d) 8,734 9,670 Condensate shrink (MMBtu/d) 4,682 5,930 Condensate sales (Bbls/d) 961 1,217 Percentage of total net margin 13.5 % 19.0 % Percentage of Proceeds: Wellhead purchases (MMBtu/d) 184,294 219,800 NGL sales (Bbls/d) 6,634 6,975 Residue sales (MMBtu/d) 24,835 24,270 Condensate sales (Bbls/d) 1,644 1,705 Percentage of total net margin 61.6 % 55.0 % Fee: Wellhead volumes (MMBtu/d) 1,076,518 1,120,500 Average rate ($/MMBtu) $ 0.18 $ 0.17 Percentage of total net margin 24.8 % 26.0 % Operating Results The financial and operating results set forth in the table above have been restated to reflect the transfer of the natural gas liquids marketing business that was previously included in our Gathering and Processing segment to our new Natural Gas Liquids segment. The change in net margin for 2005, compared with 2004, is primarily due to: an increase of $18.8 million attributable to our keep whole contracts, net of hedging, due primarily to an increase in our gross processing spread, an increase of $8.0 million due to higher natural gas and NGL prices on our POP contracts, net of hedging, and a decrease of $6.5 million due to the sale of certain natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas in December 2005. The gross processing spread for 2005, which is the relative difference in economic value between NGLs and natural gas on a Btu basis, was higher than the previous five year average of $1.78. The gross processing spread in 2005 was $2.77 per MMBtu versus $2.47 per MMBtu in 2004. Improved contractual terms for gas gathering and processing, resulting from our continued efforts to renegotiate under performing gas purchase, gas processing and gas gathering contracts, continue to positively impact net margin. The increase in operating costs for 2005 is primarily due to an increase of $1.5 million in materials, supplies and utilities related to compressor utilization and maintenance, and a $1.1 million increase from the higher cost of chemicals. The remaining increase is associated with higher employee related costs. Operating income for 2005 includes a $264.2 million gain on the sale of our natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas to a subsidiary of Eagle Rock Energy, Inc. in December 2005. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information. The decrease in other income (expense) for 2005 is primarily due to an impairment of $5.9 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to a 50 percent equity investment in an Oklahoma gas plant which we do not operate and a $1.3 million gain from our 2004 sale of propane distribution assets located in south Texas. The remaining decrease is due to an accrual of a $0.5 million insurance deductible associated with VESCO. The Venice, Louisiana plant suffered damage in August 2005 from Hurricane Katrina. Management expects that insurance payments from our carriers will cover the remaining costs associated with repairing the damage to the facility. The facility is expected to be back in partial service by March 31, 2006. The increase in capital expenditures for 2005 is primarily related to well connects and additional compression expenditures. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The increase in net margin in 2004, compared with 2003, is primarily due to: an increase of $16.8 million due to favorable commodity pricing for natural gas and NGL products on our POP contracts, an increase of $50.2 million attributable to our keep whole contracts due primarily to an increase in our gross processing spread, and an increase of $1.8 million due to higher NGL production and sales, partially offset by reduced natural gas sales. The increase in operating costs in 2004, compared with 2003, is primarily attributable to approximately $3.6 million of charges associated with various contractual dispute settlements in 2004. Employee costs were also $2.7 million higher in 2004 compared with 2003. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to shorter depreciation lives on certain capital expenditures, the acquisition of new properties and our normal capital expenditure program. Risk Management We use derivative instruments to minimize the risks associated with price volatility. In 2005 and 2004, we used a variety of instruments including physical forward sales, NYMEX natural gas futures, NYMEX crude oil futures, and over the counter natural gas and natural gas liquid swaps to hedge the cash flows for the purchases and sales of natural gas, sales of condensate and sales of NGLs produced by our operations. We used physical forward sales and derivative instruments to secure a certain price for natural gas, condensate and NGL products. The keep whole spread is hedged with a combination of derivative instruments for the purchase of natural gas and derivative instruments and physical forward sales for NGLs. The realized financial impact of the derivative transactions is included in our operating income in the period that the physical transaction occurs. The following table sets forth the 2006 hedging information for our Gathering and Processing segment for the periods indicated. Three Months Ending March 31, 2006 Year Ending December 31, 2006 Product Volumes Hedged Average Price Volumes Hedged Average Price Percent of Proceeds: Condensate (a) 75 MBbls $52.00 60.00/Bbl 300 MBbls $52.00 60.00/Bbl Natural gas (a) 0.5 Bcf $6.15 11.00/MMBtu 1.9 Bcf $6.15 11.00/MMBtu Natural gas (b) 0.5 Bcf $9.76/MMBtu 0.5 Bcf $9.76/MMBtu (a) Hedged with NYMEX based costless collars. (b) Hedged with NYMEX futures and basis swaps. We continue to evaluate market conditions for the remainder of 2006 to take advantage of favorable pricing opportunities for our company owned production associated with the POP contracts, as well as our keep whole quantities. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Natural Gas Liquids Overview Our Natural Gas Liquids segment gathers, stores, fractionates and treats raw NGLs produced from gas processing plants located in Oklahoma, Kansas and the Texas panhandle. We connect the NGL production basins in Oklahoma, Kansas and the Texas panhandle with the key NGL market centers in Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu, Texas. Most natural gas produced at the wellhead contains a mixture of NGL components such as ethane, propane, iso butane, normal butane and natural gasoline. Natural gas processing plants remove the NGLs from the natural gas stream to realize the higher economic value of the NGLs and to meet natural gas pipeline quality specifications, which limit NGLs in the natural gas stream due to liquid and Btu content. The NGLs that are separated from the natural gas stream at the natural gas processing plants remain in a mixed, raw form until they are gathered, primarily by pipeline, and delivered to our fractionators. A fractionator, by applying heat and pressure, separates each NGL component into marketable products, such as ethane/propane mix, propane, iso butane, normal 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements butane and natural gasoline (collectively, NGL products). These NGL products are then stored and or distributed to petrochemical, heating and motor gasoline manufacturers. Acquisition The following acquisition is discussed beginning on page 25. In July 2005, we acquired natural gas liquids businesses from Koch. Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for our Natural Gas Liquids segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2005 2004 2003 (Thousands of dollars) Natural gas liquids and condensate sales $ 2,361,488 $ 1,243,347 $ 1,018,622 Storage and fractionation revenues 98,887 13,151 4,995 Cost of sales 2,372,486 1,232,082 1,007,779 Net margin 87,889 24,416 15,838 Operating costs 33,460 9,462 9,281 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 11,060 119 59 Operating income $ 43,369 $ 14,835 $ 6,498 Other income (expense), net $ 231 $ (148 ) $ (86 ) Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2005 2004 2003 Natural gas liquids gathered (MBbls/d) (a) 191 Natural gas liquids sales (MBbls/d) 207 109 112 Natural gas liquids fractionated (MBbls/d) (a) 292 Capital expenditures (Thousands of dollars) $ 12,220 $ 9,264 $ 154 (a) Data presented for 2005 represents the per day results of operations from July 1, 2005. Operating Results The results of operations for 2004 and 2003 set forth above are related to the natural gas liquids marketing business that was previously included in our Gathering and Processing segment. The increases for 2005 are primarily related to the natural gas liquids assets acquired in July 2005. The increases associated with the acquisition for 2005 include: an increase in net margin of $57.4 million, an increase in operating costs of $22.2 million, and an increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization of $10.3 million. The remaining net margin increase for 2005 is primarily related to increased storage margins of $4.8 million from restructured storage contracts. Increased storage regulatory compliance costs resulted in an additional $1.7 million in operating costs for 2005, compared with 2004. The increase in net margins for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with the same period in 2003, was primarily due to increased storage margins and higher NGL prices. Storage margins increased $10.2 million primarily from the addition of storage and pipeline assets located in Conway, Kansas. Pipelines and Storage Overview Our Pipelines and Storage segment, formerly Transportation and Storage, operates our intrastate natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas storage, regulated natural gas liquids gathering and distribution pipelines, and non processable natural gas gathering facilities. We also provide interstate natural gas transportation and storage service under Section 311(a) of the NGPA. In Oklahoma, we have access to the major natural gas producing areas, allowing for natural gas and natural gas liquids to be moved throughout the state. We have access to the major natural gas producing area in south central Kansas. In Texas, we 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements are connected to the major natural gas producing areas in the Texas panhandle and the Permian Basin, providing for natural gas to be moved to the Waha Hub, where other pipelines may be accessed for transportation east to the Houston Ship Channel market and west to the California market. Our natural gas liquids gathering connections provide for raw NGLs gathered in Oklahoma, Kansas and the Texas panhandle to be delivered to our fractionation facilities in these states and to our natural gas liquids distribution pipelines which allows for access to the two main NGL market centers in Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu, Texas. Acquisitions and Divestitures The following acquisitions and divestitures are described beginning on page 25. In December 2005, we sold approximately ten miles of non contiguous, natural gas gathering pipelines in Texas. In July 2005, we acquired the FERC regulated assets that were part of the acquisition from Koch. In January 2003, we acquired natural gas transmission assets as part of the purchase of our Texas assets. Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for our Pipelines and Storage segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2005 2004 2003 (Thousands of dollars) Transportation and gathering revenues $ 151,490 $ 101,950 $ 102,812 Storage revenues 51,562 45,791 42,086 Gas sales and other revenues 22,598 19,694 16,401 Cost of sales and fuel 54,036 40,887 47,637 Net margin 171,614 126,548 113,662 Operating costs 63,326 49,414 46,186 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 23,702 17,349 16,694 Operating income $ 84,586 $ 59,785 $ 50,782 Other income (expense), net $ (657 ) $ 2,835 $ 1,495 Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ $ $ (645 ) Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2005 2004 2003 Natural gas transported (MMcf) 486,635 432,844 449,261 Natural gas liquids transported (MBbls/d) (a) 187 Natural gas liquids gathered (MBbls/d) (a) 53 Capital expenditures (Thousands of dollars) $ 15,719 $ 12,287 $ 15,234 Average natural gas price ($/MMBtu) (mid continent region) $ 7.30 $ 5.54 $ 5.06 (a) Data presented for 2005 represents the per day results of operations from July 1, 2005. Operating Results Net margin, which increased in 2005, compared with 2004, was affected by: an increase of $26.4 million related to revenues on natural gas liquids gathering and distribution pipelines acquired in July 2005, an increase of $20.5 million in natural gas transport revenues resulting from increased throughput due to favorable weather conditions for transportation, our improved fuel position and significantly higher commodity prices, an increase of $5.8 million related to increased storage revenues from renegotiated contracts, improved fuel position and higher commodity prices, and a decrease of $5.8 million related to lower net margins on equity natural gas inventory sales. The increase in operating costs in 2005, compared with 2004, is due to: an increase of $11.5 million for natural gas liquids gathering and distribution pipelines acquired in July 2005, increased outside services costs of $1.7 million primarily driven by regulatory compliance requirements, and higher employee costs offset in part by lower litigation costs as compared with 2004. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization of approximately $6.4 million for 2005 is primarily related to the newly acquired natural gas liquids pipelines. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The decrease in other income (expense), net, for 2005 is due in part to the gain on the sale of certain assets in 2004. Also impacting 2005 is a $2.6 million impairment charge related to one of our gas gathering partnerships that may terminate in early 2006, partially offset by a $0.9 million gain on sale of non contiguous, natural gas gathering pipelines in Texas. Net margin, which increased in 2004, compared with 2003, was affected by: an increase of $8.9 million related to the sale of operational gas inventory in December 2004, increased storage revenues of $2.4 million due to spot storage transactions resulting from the weather and favorable forward pricing in 2004, decreased cost of sales and fuel of $1.7 million primarily related to lower transportation volumes partially offset by increased fuel consumed and higher fuel prices, resulting from increased storage activity, and decreased volumes transported as a result of milder and wetter weather reducing irrigation, power generation and heating demands. The increase in operating costs in 2004, compared with 2003, is due to: increased regulatory and pipeline integrity compliance costs of $2.9 million, and higher employee costs and legal costs for settled litigation. In 2004, other income (expense), net includes the gain on the sale of the Texas assets of $6.9 million, which is partially offset by litigation costs. Energy Services Overview Our Energy Services segments primary focus is to create value for our customers by delivering physical products and risk management services through our network of contracted gas supply, transportation and storage capacity. These services include meeting our customers baseload, swing and peaking natural gas commodity requirements on a year round basis. To provide these bundled services, we lease storage and transportation capacity. Our total storage capacity under lease is 86 Bcf, with maximum withdrawal capability of 2.3 Bcf/d and maximum injection capability of 1.6 Bcf/d. Our current transportation capacity is 1.9 Bcf/d. The contracted storage and transportation capacity connects the major supply and demand centers throughout the United States and into Canada. With these contracted assets, our business strategies include identifying, developing and delivering specialized services and products for premium value to our customers, which are primarily LDCs, electric utilities, and commercial and industrial end users. Also, our storage and transportation capacity allows us opportunities to optimize these positions through our application of market knowledge and risk management skills. Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for our Energy Services segment for the periods indicated. In the third quarter of 2005, we made the decision to sell our Spring Creek power plant, located in central Oklahoma, and exit the power generation business. In October 2005, we concluded that our Spring Creek power plant had been impaired and recorded an impairment expense of $52.2 million. These assets were held for sale at December 31, 2005, and, accordingly, this component of our business is accounted for as discontinued operations, in accordance with Statement 144. The discontinued operations are excluded from the financial and operating results below. For additional information, see discussion of discontinued operations on page 43. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2005 2004 2003 (Thousands of dollars) Energy and power revenues $ 8,345,091 $ 2,720,629 $ 6,462 Energy trading revenues, net 12,680 113,814 229,782 Other revenues 980 849 961 Cost of sales and fuel 8,152,391 2,661,286 8,508 Net margin 206,360 174,006 228,697 Operating costs 38,598 33,261 32,226 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,071 1,554 1,612 Operating income $ 165,691 $ 139,191 $ 194,859 Other income (expense), net $ (8,635 ) $ (6,920 ) $ (9,272 ) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax $ $ $ (141,982 ) 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2005 2004 2003 Natural gas marketed (Bcf) 1,191 1,073 1,012 Natural gas gross margin ($/Mcf) $ 0.14 $ 0.14 $ 0.17 Physically settled volumes (Bcf) 2,387 2,157 2,028 Capital expenditures (Thousands of dollars) $ 159 $ 1,806 $ 555 Operating Results Net margins increased for 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to: an increase of $41.9 million in transportation margins, net of economic hedges, due to improved natural gas basis differentials primarily in the fourth quarter of 2005 associated with certain capacity held in the Mid Continent region, an increase of $22.6 million in wholesale physical marketing margins resulting from favorable natural gas price volatility primarily in the fourth quarter of 2005, and an increase of $6.8 million in power trading margins related to improved Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market heat rates attributable to a 13.2 percent increase in cooling degree days compared to normal and a 10.0 percent increase in cooling days compared with the same period in 2004. These increases in net margin were partially offset by: a net decrease of $18.3 million in storage margins from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness primarily related to natural gas basis movements attributable to anticipated storage withdrawals from the 2006/2007 heating season, a decrease of $18.4 million resulting from less favorable price movements in 2005 related to our natural gas fixed price activities, and a decrease of $2.2 million in retail activities related to reduced physical margins. The increase in operating costs in 2005, compared with 2004, is primarily due to increased employee related costs of $1.3 million and increased legal costs of $2.9 million. Our natural gas in storage at December 31, 2005, was 62.1 Bcf compared with 70.6 Bcf at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, our total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 86 Bcf compared with 84 Bcf at December 31, 2004. Net margin was negatively affected in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to: a decrease of $43.7 million in margins from marketing and seasonal natural gas sales from storage resulting from lower inter regional basis spreads early in 2004, a decrease of $35.9 million attributable to lower natural gas price volatility and the impact it had on our trading margins, and a decrease of $4.7 million resulting from weaker spark spreads in ERCOT. These decreases in net margin were partially offset by: increased revenues of $9.5 million in reservation fees received for natural gas peaking services and increased revenues of $20.5 million related to the seasonal spread, which resulted in increased sales volumes as we recycled natural gas in storage during the fourth quarter of 2004. Natural gas volumes marketed increased for 2005, compared with 2004, due to our expanded Canadian operations, additional long term transportation contracts and opportunities to sell into supply constrained markets. Natural gas volumes increased in 2004, compared with 2003, due to our Canadian operations and higher natural gas storage inventory levels at the beginning of 2004, which shifted purchased volumes from storage injections to regional sales. The acquisition of natural gas storage capacity has become more competitive as a result of new entrants from the financial services sector, the increase in the spread between summer and winter natural gas prices, and natural gas price volatility. The increased demand for storage capacity has resulted in an increase in both the cost of leasing storage capacity and the required term of the lease. Longer terms for our storage capacity leases could result in significant increases in our contractual commitments. At the beginning of the third quarter of 2004, we completed a reorganization of our Energy Services segment and renewed our focus on our physical marketing and storage business. We separated the management and operations of our wholesale marketing, retail marketing and trading activities and began accounting separately for the different types of revenue earned from these activities. Prior to the third quarter of 2004, we managed our Energy Services segment on an integrated basis and presented all energy trading activity on a net basis. 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Concurrent with this reorganization, we evaluated the accounting treatment related to the presentation of revenues from the different types of activities to determine which amounts should be reported on a gross or net basis under the guidance in EITF Issue No. 03 11, Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not Held for Trading Purposes as Defined in EITF Issue No. 02 3 (EITF 03 11). For derivative instruments considered held for trading purposes that result in physical delivery, the indicators in EITF Issue No. 02 3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities were used to determine the proper treatment. These activities and all financially settled derivative contracts will continue to be reported on a net basis. For derivative instruments that are not considered held for trading purposes and that result in physical delivery, the indicators in EITF 03 11 and EITF Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent (EITF 99 19) were used to determine the proper treatment. We began accounting for the realized revenues and purchase costs of these contracts that result in physical delivery on a gross basis beginning with the third quarter of 2004. We apply the indicators in EITF 99 19 to determine the appropriate accounting treatment for non derivative contracts that result in physical delivery. Derivatives that qualify for the normal purchase or sale exception as defined in Statement 133 are also reported on a gross basis. Prior periods have not been adjusted for this change; therefore, comparisons to prior periods may not be meaningful. Reporting of these transactions on a gross basis did not impact operating income but resulted in an increase to revenues and cost of sales and fuel. The following table shows the margins by activity, beginning with our reorganization on July 1, 2004. Year EndedDecember 31, 2005 Six Months EndedDecember 31, 2004 (Thousands of dollars) Marketing and storage, gross $ 350,227 $ 126,989 Less: Storage and transportation costs (174,838 ) (72,661 ) Marketing and storage, net 175,389 54,328 Retail marketing 17,526 8,628 Financial trading 13,445 23,221 Net margin $ 206,360 $ 86,177 Marketing and storage activities primarily include physical marketing (purchase and sales) using our firm storage and transportation capacity, including cash flow and fair value hedges and other derivative instruments to manage our risk associated with these activities. The combination of owning supply, controlling strategic assets and risk management services allows us to provide commodity diverse products and services to our customers such as peaking and load following services. Power activities are also included in the marketing and storage business. Retail marketing includes revenues from providing physical marketing and supply services to residential and small commercial and industrial customers. Financial trading revenues include activities that are generally executed using financially settled derivatives. These activities are normally short term in nature with a focus of capturing short term price volatility. Distribution Overview Our Distribution segment provides natural gas distribution services to over two million customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas through Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service, respectively. We serve residential, commercial, industrial and transportation customers in all three states. In addition, our distribution services in Oklahoma and Kansas serve wholesale customers and Texas serves public authority customers. In September 2005, Hurricane Rita caused significant damage to customers homes and businesses in the service area of Texas Gas Service located in south Jefferson County and Port Arthur, Texas. Texas Gas Service suffered damage to its Port Arthur service center, meters in south Jefferson County and Port Arthur, Texas, and incurred system natural gas loss. The financial impact will not be material due to insurance coverage that covers property damage, natural gas loss and business interruption. Acquisition The following acquisition is described beginning on page 25: In January 2003, we acquired our Texas natural gas distribution assets. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Selected Financial Information The following table sets forth certain selected financial and operating information for our Distribution segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2005 2004 2003 (Thousands of dollars) Gas sales $ 2,094,126 $ 1,816,697 $ 1,640,323 Transportation revenues 94,160 82,006 75,322 Cost of gas 1,628,507 1,367,186 1,213,811 Gross margin 559,779 531,517 501,834 Other revenues 27,921 25,799 24,415 Net margin 587,700 557,316 526,249 Operating costs 360,351 341,651 312,814 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 113,437 105,438 95,654 Operating income $ 113,912 $ 110,227 $ 117,781 Other income (expense), net $ (1,081 ) $ 1,375 $ (278 ) Operating Results Net margin increased for 2005, compared with 2004, due to: an increase of $28.2 million resulting from the implementation of new rate schedules in Oklahoma, an increase of $2.3 million resulting from increased wholesale transactions in Kansas, an increase of $4.9 million due to the ad valorem tax recovery rider, which is offset in amortization expense, and an offsetting decrease of $5.2 million in customer sales volumes due to warmer weather. Operating costs increased for 2005, compared with 2004, due to: an increase of $12.5 million in labor and employee benefit costs, an increase of $2.0 million in bad debt expense, an increase of $3.2 million due to equipment leasing costs, higher vehicle fuel costs, and an insurance deductible related to Hurricane Rita. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased for 2005 primarily due to: a $2.9 million charge related to the replacement of our field customer service system in Texas, a $3.5 million depreciation expense related to our investment in property, plant and equipment, a $4.9 million amortization of the ad valorem tax recovery rider in Kansas, and an offsetting decrease of $3.2 million in pension expense amortization in Oklahoma which expired in 2004. Net margin increased in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to: the implementation of new rate schedules in Kansas and Oklahoma, which added $22.0 million and $14.5 million, respectively, and certain commercial and industrial customers in Oklahoma who converted to transportation rates as a result of lower volume thresholds to qualify for transportation rates, which increased transportation revenue by $1.5 million and decreased gross margin by an equivalent amount. These increases in net margin were partially offset by: decreased revenues of $4.9 million due to the impact of reduced customer usage in Kansas and Oklahoma primarily attributable to the impact of warmer weather on customers not subject to weather normalization, and increased line loss expense of $2.4 million, net of rider recoveries, in Oklahoma. Operating costs, which increased in 2004, compared with 2003, were impacted by: increased information technology costs of $7.6 million, primarily associated with our customer service system, and increased employee costs of $18.9 million. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased for 2004, compared with 2003, due to: amortization expense of $5.7 million related to the new rate schedules in Kansas and Oklahoma, and depreciation expense of $4.1 million related to our investment in property, plant and equipment. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Selected Operating Data The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for our Distribution segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2005 2004 2003 Average number of customers 2,018,900 2,008,835 1,990,757 Customers per employee 689 664 652 Capital expenditures (Thousands of dollars) $ 143,765 $ 142,515 $ 153,405 Years Ended December 31, Volumes (MMcf) 2005 2004 2003 Gas sales Residential 122,010 123,388 126,998 Commercial 39,294 41,984 45,054 Industrial 2,432 2,513 3,442 Wholesale 33,521 32,265 29,823 Public Authority 2,559 2,748 2,645 Total volumes sold 199,816 202,898 207,962 Transportation 252,180 239,914 231,425 Total volumes delivered 451,996 442,812 439,387 Years Ended December 31, Margin 2005 2004 2003 (Thousands of dollars) Gas sales Residential $ 363,265 $ 344,486 $ 325,540 Commercial 89,828 92,793 89,581 Industrial 2,785 3,496 3,183 Wholesale 6,672 5,347 5,033 Public Authority 3,069 3,389 3,175 Gross margin on gas sales 465,619 449,511 426,512 Transportation 94,160 82,006 75,322 Gross margin $ 559,779 $ 531,517 $ 501,834 Residential, commercial and industrial volumes decreased in 2005, compared with 2004, and in 2004, compared with 2003, due to: warmer weather, which primarily affects residential and commercial customers, and commercial customers migrating to new transportation rates as a result of lower minimum transport thresholds in Oklahoma. Wholesale sales represent contracted natural gas volumes that exceed the needs of our residential, commercial and industrial customer base and are available for sale to other parties. Wholesale volumes increased for 2005, as fewer volumes were required to meet the needs of residential, commercial and industrial customers, resulting in additional volume being available for sale to other parties. Public authority natural gas volumes, which remained relatively flat in 2005 compared with the prior years, reflect volumes used by state agencies and school districts serviced by Texas Gas Service. Transportation volumes increased for 2005 primarily due to commercial and industrial customers of Oklahoma Natural Gas migrating to new transportation rates as a result of lower minimum transport thresholds. Transportation volumes increased in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to: the acquisitions of the distribution system at the United States Armys Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, and a pipeline system that extends through the Rio Grande Valley region in Texas, the continued migration of commercial and industrial customers to new transportation rates as a result of lower minimum transport thresholds in Oklahoma, and 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the marketing effort by Oklahoma Natural Gas to add small usage transport customers. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditure program includes expenditures for extending service to new areas, modifying customer service lines, increasing system capabilities, general replacements and improvements. It is our practice to maintain and periodically upgrade facilities to assure safe, reliable and efficient operations. Our capital expenditure program included $38.6 million, $35.0 million and $33.5 million for new business development in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Oklahoma Regulatory Initiatives On October 4, 2005, the OCC issued a final order on our application for a rate increase by Oklahoma Natural Gas. The OCC unanimously approved an annual rate increase of $57.5 million. The Commissions administrative law judge had recommended an increase in annual revenues of approximately $58.0 million in July 2005. Oklahoma Natural Gas implemented new rates, subject to refund, on July 28, 2005, based on the judges report. Oklahoma Natural Gas and the Attorney General both filed appeals from the administrative law judges recommendation. All parties ultimately reached a settlement of the appeals, which was approved by the OCC in its final order. On January 30, 2004, the OCC issued an order allowing Oklahoma Natural Gas annual rate relief of $17.7 million in order to recover expenses related to its investment in service lines and cathodic protection, an increased level of uncollectible revenues, and a return on Oklahoma Natural Gas service lines and investment in natural gas in storage. The OCCs order also approved a modified distribution main extension policy and authorized Oklahoma Natural Gas to defer homeland security costs. The order authorized the new rates to be in effect for a maximum of 18 months and categorized $10.7 million of the annual additional revenues as interim and subject to refund until a final determination at Oklahoma Natural Gas next general rate case. This interim relief expired on July 27, 2005, and was replaced by the rate increase of $57.5 million approved on October 4, 2005. As the final rate increase exceeded the interim revenues that were subject to refund, no refund obligation was incurred associated with this rate increase. A Joint Stipulation approved by the OCC on May 16, 2002, settled a number of outstanding Oklahoma Natural Gas cases pending before the OCC. The major cases settled were the OCCs inquiry into our gas cost procurement practices during the winter of 2000/2001, an application seeking relief from improper and excessive purchased gas costs, and enforcement action against Oklahoma Natural Gas, our subsidiaries and affiliated companies. In addition, all of the open inquiries related to the annual audits of Oklahoma Natural Gas fuel adjustment clause for 1996 to 2000 were closed as a result of this Stipulation. The Stipulation had a $33.7 million value to Oklahoma Natural Gas customers that was realized over a three year period. In July 2002, immediate cash savings were provided to all Oklahoma Natural Gas customers in the form of billing credits totaling approximately $9.1 million. Oklahoma Natural Gas replaced certain natural gas contracts, which reduced natural gas costs by approximately $13.8 million, due to avoided reservation fees between April 2003 and October 2005. Storage value of $2.0 million was generated on behalf of customers. As a part of the final rate order issued on October 4, 2005, Oklahoma Natural Gas was authorized to net $1.8 million in under recovered revenues authorized for recovery under the OCCs January 30, 2004 rate order against its final December 2005 billing credit obligation. In December 2005, a final billing credit of $6.9 million was made to customers. Kansas Regulatory Initiatives On September 17, 2003, the KCC issued an order approving $45 million in rate relief pursuant to the stipulated settlement agreement with Kansas Gas Service. The order settled the rate case filed by Kansas Gas Service in January 2003 and allowed Kansas Gas Service to begin operating under the new rate schedules effective September 22, 2003. After amortization of previously deferred costs, annual operating income increased by approximately $25.8 million. On June 24, 2005, the KCC issued an order authorizing the inclusion of the natural gas cost component of uncollectible customer accounts in the Cost of Gas Rider. Kansas Gas Service began deferring the natural gas cost component of uncollectible accounts in July 2005 for subsequent recovery through the Cost of Gas Rider. The KCC staff has made several rule recommendations to segregate public utility operations within diversified utility companies or holding company business structures. If adopted, the KCC staff recommendations could result in changes to our business practices. Texas Regulatory Initiatives On November 23, 2005, Texas Gas Service filed requests for rate increases in its Port Arthur and north Texas services areas for $2.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The municipalities have suspended the proposed rates for 90 days in order to conduct further review of the filings. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements On November 12, 2003, Texas Gas Service filed an appeal with the RRC based on the denial of proposed rate filing by the cities of Port Neches, Nederland and Groves, Texas. In July 2004, the RRC approved approximately $0.9 million in annual revenue relief. The interim rates were implemented in May 2003. On October 7, 2004, Texas Gas Service filed a petition in the District Court of Travis County, Texas seeking judicial review of certain of the ratemaking decisions contained in the RRCs final order. On October 26, 2005, the district court upheld the RRC final order. On November 23, 2005, Texas Gas Service and the cities of Port Neches, Nederland and Groves, Texas appealed the decision of the District Court to the Third District Court of Appeals. A decision is expected on this appeal in 2006. General Certain costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process have been recorded as regulatory assets in accordance with Statement 71. Should recovery cease due to regulatory actions, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria of Statement 71 and, accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. Discontinued Operations Overview In September 2005, we completed the sale of our Production segment to TXOK Acquisition, Inc. for $645 million, before adjustments, and recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately $240.3 million. The gain reflects the cash received less adjustments, selling expenses and the net book value of the assets sold. The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce debt. Our Board of Directors had approved the potential sale in July 2005, which resulted in our Production segment being classified as held for sale beginning July 1, 2005. In accordance with Statement 144, we did not record any depreciation, depletion or amortization for our Production segment while it was classified as held for sale. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2005, we made the decision to sell our Spring Creek power plant and exit the power generation business. We entered into an agreement to sell our Spring Creek power plant to Westar for $53 million. The transaction requires FERC approval and is expected to be completed in 2006. The 300 megawatt gas fired merchant power plant was built in 2001 to supply electrical power during peak periods using gas powered turbine generators. The proceeds from this sale will be used to purchase other assets, repurchase ONEOK shares or retire debt. In January 2003, we sold approximately 70 percent of the natural gas and crude oil producing properties of our Production segment for an adjusted cash price of $294 million. The properties sold were in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. We recognized a pretax gain of approximately $61.2 million in 2003 related to this sale. The gain reflects the cash received less adjustments, selling expenses and the net book value of the assets sold. These components of our business are accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with Statement 144. Accordingly, amounts in our financial statements and related notes for all periods shown relating to our Production segment and our power generation business are reflected as discontinued operations. The sale of our Production segment and the pending sale of our power generation business are in line with our business strategy to sell assets when deemed less strategic or as other conditions warrant. 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Selected Financial Information The amounts of revenue, costs and income taxes reported in discontinued operations are as follows. Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (Thousands of dollars) Operating revenues $ 135,213 $ 202,552 $ 136,271 Cost of sales and fuel 38,398 95,524 76,870 Net margin 96,815 107,028 59,401 Impairment expense 52,226 Operating costs 24,302 29,997 19,270 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 17,919 30,673 18,103 Operating income 2,368 46,358 22,028 Other income (expense), net 252 60 10 Interest expense 12,588 16,167 5,953 Income taxes (3,788 ) 12,746 5,900 Income (loss) from operations of discontinued components, net $ (6,180 ) $ 17,505 $ 10,185 Gain on sale of discontinued components, net of tax of $90.7 million, $0 million and $21.5 million, respectively $ 149,577 $ $ 39,739 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES General Part of our strategy is to grow through acquisitions that strengthen and complement our existing assets. We have relied primarily on operating cash flow, borrowings from commercial paper and credit agreements, and issuance of debt and equity in the capital markets for our liquidity and capital resource requirements. We expect to continue to use these sources for liquidity and capital resource needs on both a short and long term basis. We have no material guarantees of debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated parties. During 2005 and 2004, our capital expenditures were financed through operating cash flows and short and long term debt. Capital expenditures for 2005 were $250 million, compared with $264 million in 2004, exclusive of acquisitions. Financing Financing is provided through our commercial paper program and long term debt. We also have a credit agreement, as discussed below, which is used as a back up for the commercial paper program. Other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuance of equity, issuance of mandatory convertible debt securities, issuance of trust preferred securities by ONEOK Capital Trust I or ONEOK Capital Trust II, asset securitization and sale/leaseback of facilities. The total amount of short term borrowings authorized by our Board of Directors is $2.5 billion. At December 31, 2005, we had $641.5 million in commercial paper outstanding, $900.0 million drawn on our short term bridge financing agreement, $178.7 million in letters of credit issued and approximately $7.9 million in cash and temporary investments. We also had $2.0 billion of long term debt outstanding, including current maturities. As of December 31, 2005, we could have issued $1.5 billion of additional debt under the most restrictive provisions contained in our various borrowing agreements. Both the five year credit agreement, which matures in 2009, and short term bridge financing agreement contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants relating to liens, investments, fundamental changes in our business, changes in the nature of our business, transactions with affiliates, the use of proceeds, a limit on our debt to capital ratio, a limit on investments in master limited partnerships and a covenant that prevents us from restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to ONEOK, Inc. In 2005, we amended the five year credit and the short term bridge financing agreements to change the definition of Consolidated Net Worth to eliminate the effect of gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a result of certain commodity hedging agreements. At December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all covenants. Currently, we have $48.2 million available under one of our shelf registration statements on Form S 3, for the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, debt securities, preferred stock, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units. Short term Bridge Financing Agreement In June 2005, we entered into a $1.0 billion short term bridge financing agreement. The interest rate is based, at our election, on either (i) the higher of prime or one half of one percent above the Federal Funds 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Rate, which is the rate that banks charge each other for the overnight borrowing of funds, or (ii) the Eurodollar rate plus a set number of basis points based on our current long term unsecured debt ratings by Moodys and S&P. On July 1, 2005, we borrowed $1.0 billion under the short term bridge financing agreement to assist in financing the acquisition of assets from Koch. See Note B for additional information about this acquisition. We funded the remaining acquisition cost through our commercial paper program. We anticipate permanent financing of the acquisition to come from a combination of proceeds from the sale of assets, such as our Production segment and our Spring Creek power plant, proceeds from the February 2006 settlement of the purchase contracts that were part of our mandatory convertible equity units, and free cash flow. At December 31, 2005, we had lowered the balance of outstanding indebtedness under the bridge financing agreement to $900.0 million. The reduction in indebtedness under our short term bridge financing agreement is a result of a required prepayment due to the sale of our Production segment. At our option, we paid $200.0 million on February 3, 2006. We paid an additional $403.0 million as a required prepayment on February 16, 2006, from the settlement of our equity units. The remaining balance of $297.0 million is required to be paid by March 31, 2006. In November 2005, we amended the short term bridge financing agreement to remove the requirement to prepay the loan with the net cash proceeds received from the disposition of the natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas, provided that we prepay our 7.75 percent $300.0 million long term debt due in August 2006 in full, which we did in December 2005. See further discussion below under Long term Debt. Five year Credit Agreement In July 2005, we amended our 2004 $1.0 billion five year credit agreement to increase the limit on our debt to capital ratio from 67.5 percent debt to 70.0 percent debt for the period from July 25, 2005, to February 28, 2006. Beginning on March 1, 2006, the limit on our debt will return to 67.5 percent of total capital. In September 2005, we exercised the accordion feature of our 2004 $1.0 billion five year credit agreement to increase the commitment amounts by $200 million to a total of $1.2 billion. The interest rate payable under this five year credit agreement is a floating rate calculated in the same manner as the $1.0 billion short term bridge financing agreement. Uncommitted Line of Credit We entered into a credit agreement with KBC Bank NV in April 2004. The agreement gives us access to an uncommitted line of credit for loans and letters of credit up to a maximum principal amount of $10 million. The rate charged on any outstanding amount is the higher of prime or one half of one percent above the Federal Funds overnight rate, which is the rate that banks charge each other for the overnight borrowing of funds. This agreement remains in effect until canceled by KBC Bank NV or us. This agreement does not contain any covenants more restrictive than those in our $1.2 billion five year credit agreement. In December 2005, we amended our $10.0 million agreement with KBC Bank NV to increase the maximum principal amount available under the uncommitted line of credit to $15.0 million. The increased commitment was used to issue a $15.0 million standby letter of credit. Long term Debt In November 2005, we elected to make an early redemption of our 7.75 percent $300.0 million long term notes with a stated maturity of August 2006. The early redemption occurred in December 2005, for a total payment of $314.4 million. In addition to the principal payment, we were required to pay a make whole call premium of $5.7 million and accrued interest of $8.7 million. We funded this early redemption with the proceeds from the sale of our natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas. In June 2005, we issued $800 million of notes, comprised of $400 million in 10 year maturities with a coupon of 5.2 percent and $400 million in 30 year maturities with a coupon of 6.0 percent. Proceeds from this debt issuance were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. In March 2005, $335 million of our long term debt matured. We funded payment of this debt with working capital and the issuance of commercial paper in the short term market. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table sets forth our capitalization structure for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Long term debt 53 % 54 % Equity 47 % 46 % Debt (including Notes payable) 67 % 61 % Equity 33 % 39 % Equity Units Both S&P and Moodys consider the equity units we issued in January 2003 to be part equity and part debt. For purposes of computing capitalization ratios, these rating agencies adjust the capitalization structure. S&P considers the equity units to be equal amounts of debt and equity for the first three years, with the effect being to increase shareholders equity by the same amount as long term debt, which would result in a capitalization structure of 52 percent equity and 48 percent long term debt at December 31, 2005. Moodys considers 25 percent of the equity units to be long term debt and 75 percent to be shareholders equity, which would result in a capitalization structure of 55 percent equity and 45 percent long term debt at December 31, 2005. We had 16.1 million equity units outstanding at December 31, 2005. Each unit consists of two components, an equity purchase contract and a note (see Notes G and I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information). In November 2005, we remarketed the notes with a new coupon of 5.51 percent. The notes continue to have a stated maturity of February 2008. The cash received was put into a treasury portfolio pledged as collateral against the purchase contracts. This action had no effect on our liquidity. On February 16, 2006, we successfully settled 16.1 million equity units to approximately 19.5 million shares of our common stock. Of this amount, 8.3 million shares were issued from treasury stock and approximately 11.2 million shares were newly issued. Holders of the equity units received 1.2119 shares of our common stock for each equity unit they owned. The number of shares that we issued for each stock purchase contract was determined based on our average closing price over the 20 trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to February 16, 2006. With the settlement, we received $402.4 million in cash, which was used to pay down our short term bridge financing agreement. Northern Border Partners On February 14, 2006, we signed agreements to sell certain assets to Northern Border Partners for approximately $3 billion in cash and limited partner units and increase our general partner interest in Northern Border Partners to 100 percent. We will purchase, through Northern Plains, from an affiliate of TransCanada 17.5 percent of the general partner interest in Northern Border Partners for $40 million, less $10 million for expenses associated with the transfer of operating responsibility of Northern Border Pipeline Company to TransCanada for a net payment of $30 million. After the transactions are completed, we will own approximately 37.0 million limited partner units and 100 percent of the Northern Border Partners general partner interest, increasing our total interest in Northern Border Partners to 45.7 percent. With the purchase of 17.5 percent of the general partner interest in Northern Border Partners, we will also transfer our Gathering and Processing segment, Natural Gas Liquids segment, and Pipelines and Storage segment, to Northern Border Partners in transactions valued at approximately $3 billion. We will receive approximately $1.35 billion in cash and approximately 36.5 million limited partner units from Northern Border Partners. The limited partner units and related general partner interest contribution were valued at approximately $1.65 billion at the time of the signing of the transaction. This sale, subject to adjustment, includes the natural gas liquids assets we purchased from Koch in July 2005 for $1.35 billion. We will not recognize a gain on the sale as the transfer of assets will be accounted for at the assets historical cost. We plan to use cash proceeds to reduce short term debt, acquire other assets or repurchase our common stock. The transfer of our Gathering and Processing segment, Pipelines and Storage segment, and Natural Gas Liquids segment will not affect our consolidated net income on our consolidated statements of income, total assets on our consolidated balance sheets or change in cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows since under EITF 04 5 we were already required to consolidate Northern Border Partners effective January 1, 2006. See Impact of New Accounting Standards in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for additional discussion of EITF 04 5. The limited partner units we will receive from Northern Border Partners will be a newly created Class B units with the same distribution rights as the outstanding common units, but will have limited voting rights and will be subordinated to the common units with respect to payment of minimum quarterly distributions. Distributions on the Class B units will be 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements prorated from the date of issuance. Northern Border Partners is required to hold a special election for holders of common units within 12 months of issuing the Class B units to approve the conversion of the Class B units into common units and to approve certain amendments to the partnership agreement. The proposed amendments grant voting rights for common units held by the general partner if a vote is held to remove the general partner and require fair market value compensation for the general partner interest if the general partner is removed. If the common unit holders do not approve both the conversion and amendments within 12 months of the issuance of the Class B units, then the amount payable on such Class B units would increase to 115 percent of the distributions paid on the common units and the Class B distribution rights would continue to be subordinated in the manner described above unless and until the conversion described above has been approved. If the common unit holders vote to remove us or our affiliates as the general partner of Northern Border Partners at any time prior to the approval of the conversion and amendment described above, the amount payable on such Class B units would increase to 125 percent of the distributions payable with respect to the common units and the Class B unit distribution rights would continue to be subordinated in the manner described above unless and until the conversion described above has been approved. These transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, including antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart Scott Rodino Act. We expect these transactions will be completed by April 1, 2006. Stock Buy Back Program In January 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a stock buy back program to repurchase up to 7.5 million shares of our common stock currently issued and outstanding. Our Board of Directors extended this program in November 2005, and authorized us to repurchase an additional 7.5 million shares of our common stock currently issued and outstanding. Shares are repurchased from time to time in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. The program will terminate in November 2007, unless extended by our Board of Directors. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares of our common stock pursuant to this program. Credit Rating Our credit ratings are currently a Baa2 (Stable) by Moodys and a BBB (CreditWatch with negative implications) by S&P. In October 2005, Moodys downgraded us to Baa2 from Baa1, S&P downgraded us to BBB from BBB+ and both removed the negative watch. Subsequently, in February 2006, S&P placed our credit rating on negative watch. Our credit ratings may be affected by a material change in our financial ratios or a material adverse event affecting our business. The most common criteria for assessment of our credit ratings are the debt to capital ratio, business risk profile, pretax and after tax interest coverage, and liquidity. If our credit ratings were downgraded, the interest rates on our commercial paper would increase, resulting in an increase in our cost to borrow funds, and we could potentially lose access to commercial paper borrowings. In the event that we are unable to borrow funds under our commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in our business, we have access to a $1.2 billion five year credit agreement, which expires September 16, 2009. Our Energy Services segment relies upon the investment grade rating of our senior unsecured long term debt to satisfy credit requirements with most of our counterparties. If our credit ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to participate in energy marketing and trading activities could be significantly limited. Without an investment grade rating, we may be required to fund margin requirements with our counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments. At December 31, 2005, the amount we could have been required to fund for the few counterparties with which we have a Credit Support Annex within our International Swaps and Derivatives Association Agreements is approximately $89.3 million. A decline in our credit rating below investment grade may also significantly impact other business segments. We have reviewed our commercial paper agreement, trust indentures, building leases, equipment leases, marketing, trading and risk contracts, and other various contracts which may be subject to rating triggers, and we do not have significant exposure. Rating triggers are defined as provisions that would create an automatic default or acceleration of indebtedness based on a change in our credit rating. Our five year credit and short term bridge financing agreements contain a provision that would cause the cost to borrow funds to increase based on the amount borrowed under these agreements if our credit rating is negatively adjusted. The agreements also contain a default provision based on a material adverse change. An adverse rating change is not defined as a default or material adverse change. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price volatility. Significant fluctuations in commodity price in either physical or financial energy contracts may impact our overall liquidity due to the impact the commodity price change has on items such as the cost of NGLs and gas held in storage, increased margin requirements, collectibility of certain energy related receivables and working capital. We believe that our current commercial paper program and debt capacity are adequate to meet our liquidity requirements associated with commodity price volatility. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans We calculate benefit obligations based upon generally accepted actuarial methodologies using the projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements obligation for other postretirement plans. Pension costs and other postretirement obligations as of December 31 are determined using a September 30 measurement date. The benefit obligations are the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed to employee service rendered. The PBO is measured using the pension benefit formula and assumptions as to future compensation levels. A plans funded status is calculated as the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. Our funding policy for the pension plans is to make annual contributions in accordance with regulations under the Internal Revenue Code and in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles. Contributions made to the pension plan and postretirement benefit plan in 2005 were $1.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively. For 2006, we anticipate our total contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and postretirement benefit plan to be $1.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively, and our pay as you go other postretirement benefit plan costs to be $14.0 million. We believe we have adequate resources to fund our obligations under our plans. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows combines cash flows from discontinued operations with cash flows from continuing operations within each category. Discontinued operations accounted for approximately $77.2 million, $16.9 million and $(68.0) million in operating cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Discontinued operations accounted for approximately $(44.4), $(52.9) and $(18.7) million in investing cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and did not account for any financing cash flows. The absence of cash flows from our discontinued operations is not expected to have a significant impact on our future cash flows. Operating Cash Flows Operating cash flows decreased by $385.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the same period in 2004. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily the result of a net increase in working capital of $301.3 million in 2004, compared with a net increase in working capital of $597.5 million in 2005. These increases primarily related to increases in accounts receivable and natural gas inventory, partially offset by increases in accounts payable. Working capital changes had the opposite impact on 2004, compared with 2003, contributing to an increase in operating cash flows of $203.7 million. The impact of higher commodity prices on accounts receivable, accounts payable and natural gas inventory negatively impacted operating cash flows for all periods. There is typically a lag between when payment is made for natural gas purchased for our distribution customers and when the customers are billed. This is due to the cycle billing process where distribution customers are billed throughout the month. Under level prices, this lag would have no impact on cash flows from year to year, but with increased prices, this lag resulted in a negative impact on cash flows. Our Energy Services segments deposits, or margin requirements, increase or decrease from year to year based on the level of open positions on our contracts as well as commodity prices and price volatility. With the increase in commodity prices at December 31, 2005, we were required to meet additional margin requirements, which also negatively impacted operating cash flows. Investing Cash Flows Acquisitions in 2005 primarily represent the cash purchase of the Koch assets. The sale of our Production segment resulted in proceeds from the sale of discontinued component. The proceeds from sale of assets in 2005 primarily resulted from the sale of our natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas. Additionally, the sale of Cimarex Energy Company common stock, formerly Magnum Hunter Resources (MHR) common stock, is also included in proceeds from sale of assets. This common stock was acquired upon exercise of MHR stock purchase warrants in February 2005, resulting in our paying $22.7 million, which is included in changes in other investments, net. Acquisitions in 2004 represent the cash purchase of Northern Plains. Increased capital expenditures in 2004 were primarily incurred by our discontinued Production segment. Proceeds from the sale of assets include the sales of certain natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines, compression assets, natural gas distribution systems and investments in 2004. Acquisitions in 2003 primarily represent the cash purchase of our Texas distribution assets and the purchase of natural gas and crude oil properties and related flow lines. Proceeds from the sale of discontinued component represents the sale of natural gas and crude oil producing properties for a cash sales price of $294 million, including adjustments, of which $15 million was received in 2002. Financing Cash Flows During 2005, we borrowed $1.0 billion under the short term bridge financing agreement to assist in financing the acquisition of natural gas liquids assets from Koch. We funded the remaining acquisition cost through our commercial paper program. We reduced our indebtedness under our short term bridge financing agreement by $100.0 million as a result of a required prepayment due to the sale of our Production segment. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During 2005, we paid $233.0 million to repurchase 7.5 million shares of our stock pursuant to a plan approved by our Board of Directors in 2005. This plan allows us to repurchase up to a total of 15 million shares of our common stock on or before November 17, 2007. In December 2005, we made an early redemption of our 7.75 percent $300.0 million long term notes with a stated maturity of August 2006. In addition to the principal payment, we were required to pay a make whole call premium of $5.7 million and accrued interest of $8.7 million for a total payment of $314.4 million. We funded this early redemption with the proceeds from the sale of our natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas. In June 2005, we issued $800 million of long term notes and used a portion of the proceeds to repay commercial paper. The commercial paper had been issued to finance the Northern Border Partners acquisition, to repay $335 million of long term debt that matured on March 1, 2005, and to meet operating needs. This increase was partially offset by $643 million in payments on notes payable and commercial paper, which represents the cash received from the sale of our Production segment, and payments made in the normal course of operations. During the first quarter of 2005, we terminated $400 million of our interest rate swap agreements and paid a net amount of $19.4 million, which included $20.2 million for the present value of future payments at the time of termination, less $0.8 million for interest rate savings through the termination of the swaps. The $20.2 million payment has been recorded as a reduction in long term debt and will be recognized in the income statement over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged. In the second quarter of 2005, we terminated $500 million of our treasury rate lock agreements, which resulted in our paying $2.4 million. This amount, net of tax, has been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be recognized in the income statement over the term of the related debt issuances. During the first quarter of 2004, we repaid $600 million in notes payable using cash generated from operating activities and proceeds from our February 2004 equity offering. During the second half of 2004, we incurred $644 million of notes payable, which includes the acquisition of Northern Plains and funds used in the ordinary course of business. We terminated $670 million of our interest rate swap agreements in the first quarter of 2004 to lock in savings and generate a positive cash flow of $91.8 million, which included $8.9 million of interest savings previously recognized. These interest rate swaps were previously initiated as a strategy to hedge the fair value of fixed rate long term debt. The proceeds received upon termination of the interest rate swaps, net of amounts previously recognized, will be recognized in the income statement over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged. During the first quarter of 2004, we sold 6.9 million shares of our common stock to an underwriter at $21.93 per share, resulting in proceeds to us, before expenses, of $151.3 million. During the first quarter of 2003, we issued a total of 16.1 million equity units at the public offering price of $25 per unit, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $24.25 per share, or $390.4 million. Each equity unit consists of a stock purchase contract for the purchase of shares of our common stock and, initially, a senior note due February 16, 2008, issued pursuant to an Indenture with SunTrust Bank, as trustee. The equity units carry a total annual coupon rate of 8.5 percent (4.0 percent annual face amount of the senior notes plus 4.5 percent annual contract adjustment payments). The interest expense associated with the 4.0 percent senior notes will be recognized in the income statement on an accrual basis over the term of the senior notes. The present value of the contract adjustment payments was accrued as a liability with a charge to equity at the time of the transactions. Accordingly, there will be no impact on earnings in future periods as this liability is paid, except for the interest recognized as a result of discounting the liability to its present value at the time of the transaction. This interest expense will be approximately $3.5 million over three years. The present value of the contract adjustment payments is accounted for as equity and reduces paid in capital. The number of shares that we issued for each stock purchase contract issued as part of the equity units was determined based on our average closing price over the 20 trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to February 16, 2006. Also, during the first quarter of 2003, we issued a total of 13.8 million shares of common stock at the public offering price of $17.19 per share, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $16.524 per share, or $228 million. In January 2003, we issued common stock and equity units, which were partially offset by the payment of notes payable and the repurchase of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from Westar in February 2003. In August 2003, we repurchased $50 million or approximately 2.6 million shares of our common stock from Westar. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERICAL COMMITMENTS We lease various buildings, facilities and equipment, which are accounted for as operating leases. We lease vehicles which are accounted for as operating leases for financial purposes and capital leases for tax purposes. The following table sets forth our contractual obligations to make future payments under our current debt agreements, operating lease agreements and fixed price contracts.

Long term debt as reported in the consolidated balance sheets includes unamortized debt discount and the mark to market effect of interest rate swaps. Purchase commitments exclude commodity purchase contracts. Our Distribution segment is a party to fixed price transportation contracts. However, the costs associated with these contracts are recovered through rates as allowed by the applicable regulatory agency and are excluded from the table above. OTHER Environmental We are subject to multiple environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid wastes and hazardous material and substance management. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines, penalties and or interruptions in our operations that could be material to the results of operations. If an accidental leak or spill of hazardous materials occurs from our lines or facilities, in the process of transporting natural gas or NGLs, or at any facility that we own, operate or otherwise use, we could be held jointly and severally liable for all resulting liabilities, including investigation and clean up costs, which could materially affect our results of operations and cash flow. In addition, emission controls required under the Federal Clean Air Act and other similar federal and state laws could require unexpected capital expenditures at our facilities. We cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We own or retain legal responsibility for the environmental conditions at 12 former manufactured gas sites in Kansas. These sites contain potentially harmful materials that are subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. A consent agreement with the KDHE presently governs all work at these sites. The terms of the consent agreement allow us to investigate these sites and set remediation activities based upon the results of the investigations and risk analysis. We have commenced active remediation on eight sites, with regulatory closure achieved at two of these locations, and have begun assessments at the four remaining sites. The site situations are not similar, and we have no previous experience with similar remediation efforts. We have completed some analysis of the four remaining sites, but are unable to accurately estimate individual or aggregate costs that may be required to satisfy our remedial obligations. Our preliminary review of similar cleanup efforts at former manufactured gas sites reveals that costs can range from $100,000 to $10 million per site. These estimates do not consider potential 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements insurance recoveries, recoveries through rates or from unaffiliated parties, to which we may be entitled. At this time, we have not recorded any amounts for potential insurance recoveries or recoveries from unaffiliated parties, and we are not recovering any environmental amounts in rates. Total costs to remediate the two sites, which have achieved regulatory closure, was approximately $700,000. Total remedial costs for each of the remaining sites are expected to exceed $500,000 per site, but there is no assurance that costs to investigate and remediate the remaining sites will not be significantly higher. As more information related to the site investigations and remediation activities becomes available, and to the extent such amounts are expected to exceed our current estimates, additional expenses could be recorded. Such amounts could be material to our results of operations and cash flows depending on the remediation done and number of years over which the remediation is completed. Our expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation to date have not been significant in relation to the results of operations and there were no material effects upon earnings during 2005 related to compliance with environmental regulations.

Other factors and assumptions not identified above were also involved in the making of the forward looking statements. The failure of those assumptions to be realized, as well as other factors, may also cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. We have no obligation and make no undertaking to update publicly or revise any forward looking information. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK Non Regulated Businesses, Including Energy Services We are exposed to market risk and the impact of market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and power prices. Market risk refers to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in commodity energy prices. Our primary exposure arises from fixed price purchase or sale agreements that extend for periods of up to three years, natural gas in storage utilized by our Energy Services segment, NGLs in storage utilized by our Natural Gas Liquids segment, the difference in price between natural gas and NGL prices with respect to our keep whole processing agreements, and purchases of natural gas and crude oil. To a lesser extent, we are exposed to the risk of changing prices or the cost of intervening transportation resulting from purchasing natural gas and NGLs at one location and selling it at another (referred to as basis risk). To minimize the risk from market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, we use commodity derivative instruments such as futures contracts, swaps and options to manage market risk of existing or anticipated purchase and sale agreements, existing physical natural gas in storage, and basis risk. We adhere to policies and procedures that limit our exposure to market risk from open positions and that monitor our market risk exposure. The following table sets forth the fair value component of the energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities, excluding derivative instruments that have been declared as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair Value Component of Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities (Thousands of dollars) Net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2004 $ 17,951 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period 18,326 Fair value of new contracts when entered into during the period 3,596 Other changes in fair value (9,537 ) Net fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2005 $ 30,336 The net fair value of contracts outstanding includes the effect of settled energy contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of market movements on the fair value of energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities. Fair value estimates consider the market in which the transactions are executed. The market in which exchange traded and over the counter transactions are executed is a factor in determining fair value. We 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements utilize third party references for pricing points from NYMEX and third party over the counter brokers to establish the commodity pricing and volatility curves. We believe the reported transactions from these sources are the most reflective of current market prices. Fair values are subject to change based on valuation factors. The estimate of fair value includes an adjustment for the liquidation of the position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions. The fair value estimate also considers the risk of nonperformance based on credit considerations of the counterparty. The following table sets forth the maturity schedule of our energy trading contracts based on the heating season from April through March. This maturity schedule is consistent with our business strategy.

These fair values are reflected as a component of assets and liabilities from energy marketing and risk management activities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (b) Values are derived from the energy market price quotes from national commodity trading exchanges that primarily trade future and option commodity contracts. (c) Values are obtained through energy commodity brokers or electronic trading platforms, whose primary service is to match willing buyers and sellers of energy commodities. Energy price information by location is readily available because of the large energy broker network. (d) Values derived in this category utilize market price information from the other two categories, as well as other assumptions for liquidity and credit. The following table sets forth our Energy Services segments financial and commodity risk from fixed price transactions at December 31, 2005.

For further discussion of trading activities, see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Also, see Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Regulated Businesses Kansas Gas Service uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of anticipated natural gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect Kansas Gas Service customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural gas. At December 31, 2005, Kansas Gas Service had derivative instruments in place to hedge the cost of natural gas purchases for 2.4 Bcf, which represents part of their gas purchase requirements for the 2005/2006 winter heating months. Gains or losses associated with the Kansas Gas Service hedges are included in and recoverable through the monthly PGA. Value at Risk (VAR) Disclosure of Market Risk We measure market risk in the energy marketing and risk management, trading and non trading portfolios of our non regulated businesses using a VAR methodology, which estimates the expected maximum loss of the portfolio over a specified time horizon within a given confidence interval. Our VAR calculations are based on the Monte Carlo approach. The quantification of market risk using VAR provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance, to determine risk targets and set position limits. The use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions, including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation. Inputs to the calculation include prices, volatilities, positions, instrument valuations and the variance covariance matrix. Historical data is used to estimate our VAR with more weight given to recent data, which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements. We rely on VAR to determine the potential reduction in the portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period. While management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable, no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating VAR. Different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different VAR estimates. Our VAR exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized for our non regulated businesses energy marketing and risk management, non trading and trading portfolios of derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and natural gas in storage due to adverse market movements. A one day time horizon and a 95 percent confidence level were used in our VAR data. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the VAR calculation based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices, operating exposures and timing thereof, and the changes in our derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and natural gas in storage. VAR information should be evaluated in light of these assumptions and the methodologys other limitations. The potential impact on our future earnings, as measured by the VAR, was $30.1 million and $9.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The following table details the average, high and low VAR calculations. Years Ended December 31, Value at Risk 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Average $ 16.4 $ 3.8 High $ 44.0 $ 17.7 Low $ 6.2 $ 0.6 The variations in the VAR data are reflective of market volatility and changes in the portfolios during the year. The 2005 increase in VAR, compared with 2004, is primarily due to the increase in natural gas prices in the third and fourth quarters of 2005, which mainly resulted from supply disruption caused by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. Risk Policy and Oversight We control the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. The audit committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibilities for our risk management limits and policies. Our risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price, credit and interest rate risk management, and marketing and trading activities. The committee also proposes risk metrics including VAR and dollar loss limits. We have a corporate risk control organization led by our Senior Vice President of Financial Services and Treasurer and our Vice President of Audit and Risk Control, who are assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies, procedures and limits. Key risk control activities include credit review and approval, credit and performance risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics. To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably. As a result, we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY RISK Interest Rate Risk We are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the normal course of business. We manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates. At December 31, 2005, the interest rate on 82.8 percent of our long term debt was fixed after considering the impact of interest rate swaps. During the first quarter of 2005, we terminated $400 million of our interest rate swap agreements and paid a net amount of $19.4 million, which included $20.2 million for the present value of future payments at the time of termination, less $0.8 million for interest rate savings through the termination of the swaps. During the first quarter of 2004, we terminated $670 million of our interest rate swap agreements and received $81.9 million. The net savings from the termination of these swaps is being recognized in interest expense over the terms of the debt instruments originally hedged. Net interest expense savings for 2005 for all terminated swaps was $7.7 million, and the remaining net savings for all terminated swaps will be recognized over the following periods: 2006 $ 6.8 million 2007 $ 6.6 million 2008 $ 6.6 million 2009 $ 5.6 million 2010 $ 5.5 million Thereafter $ 15.3 million Currently, $340 million of fixed rate debt is swapped to floating. The floating rate debt is based on both the three and six month London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). At December 31, 2005, we recorded a net liability of $7.3 million to recognize the interest rate swaps at fair value. Long term debt was decreased by $7.3 million to recognize the change in the fair value of the related hedged liability. See Note I. Total swap savings for 2005 were $10.7 million, compared with the savings of $27.6 million in 2004. Prior to the issuance of the $800 million of notes in the second quarter of 2005, we entered into $500 million in treasury rate lock agreements to hedge the changes in cash flows of our anticipated interest payments from changes in treasury rates prior to the issuance of the notes. Upon issuance of the notes in June 2005, the treasury rate lock agreements terminated, which resulted in our paying $2.4 million. This amount, net of tax, has been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be recognized in the income statement over the term of the related debt issuances. At December 31, 2005, a 100 basis point move in the annual interest rate on all of our outstanding long term debt would change our annual interest expense by $3.4 million before taxes. This 100 basis point change assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. If interest rates changed significantly, we would take actions to manage our exposure to the change. Since a specific action and the possible effects are uncertain, no change has been assumed. Currency Rate Risk With our Energy Services segments expansion into Canada, we are subject to currency exposure related to our firm transportation and storage contracts. Our objective with respect to currency risk is to reduce the exposure due to exchange rate fluctuations. We use physical forward transactions, which result in an actual two way flow of currency on the settlement date since we exchange U.S. dollars for Canadian dollars with another party. We have not designated these transactions for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, the gains and losses associated with the change in fair value are recorded in net margin. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our exposure to risk from currency translation was not material. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
