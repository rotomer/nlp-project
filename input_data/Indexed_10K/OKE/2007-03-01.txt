ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The following discussion highlights some of our achievements and significant issues affecting us this past year. Please refer to the Financial and Operating Results section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and the Financial Statements for a complete explanation of the following items. Diluted earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations (EPS) decreased to $2.68 in 2006 from $3.73 in 2005. Excluding the gain on sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline in 2006 and excluding the 2005 gain on sale of our Texas gathering and processing assets, EPS from continuing operations decreased to $2.40 in 2006, compared with $2.53 in 2005. During 2006, we increased our dividends twice to a current annual dividend of $1.28 per share of common stock. This follows five increases in our dividends during 2005 and 2004. During the first quarter of 2007, we increased our dividend to $0.34 per share of common stock ($1.36 per share on an annualized basis). ONEOK Partners declared an increase in its cash distribution to $0.98 per unit ($3.92 per unit on an annualized basis) in January 2007, an increase of approximately 23 percent over the $0.80 paid in the first quarter of 2006. In April 2006, we sold certain assets comprising our former gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage segments to ONEOK Partners for approximately $3 billion, including $1.35 billion in cash, before adjustments, and approximately 36.5 million Class B limited partner units in ONEOK Partners. We also purchased the remaining 17.5 percent 29 Table of Contents general partner interest, which increased our general partner interest to the entire 2 percent general partner interest in ONEOK Partners. Prior periods have been restated to show our former gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage segments as part of our newly formed ONEOK Partners segment. The legacy operations of ONEOK Partners accounted for the 2006 operating income increases in our ONEOK Partners segment since we consolidated ONEOK Partners beginning January 1, 2006, in accordance with EITF Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. See Impact of New Accounting Standards beginning on page 31 for additional information on the consolidation of ONEOK Partners. In addition, the acquisition of the natural gas liquids businesses owned by Koch in July 2005, contributed to operating income increases in our ONEOK Partners segment. Our legacy operations in the ONEOK Partners segment benefited from strong commodity prices, wider gross processing spreads and increased natural gas transportation revenues. These increases were slightly offset by decreases in our ONEOK Partners segment resulting from the sale of natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas in December 2005. In 2006, operating income increased to $861.6 million from $799.0 million in 2005, an 8 percent increase. Our income from continuing operations decreased to $306.7 million in 2006 from $403.1 million in 2005. Operating income for our Energy Services segment increased $63.6 million for 2006, primarily due to the effect of improved natural gas basis differentials on transportation contracts. SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES In May 2006, a subsidiary of ONEOK Partners entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Williams to form a joint venture called Overland Pass Pipeline Company for the purpose of building a 750 mile natural gas liquids pipeline from Opal, Wyoming, to the Mid Continent natural gas liquids market center in Conway, Kansas. The pipeline will be designed to transport approximately 110,000 Bbl/d of NGLs, which can be increased to approximately 150,000 Bbl/d with additional pump facilities. A subsidiary of ONEOK Partners owns 99 percent of the joint venture, will manage the construction project, will advance all costs associated with construction and will operate the pipeline. Within two years of the pipeline becoming operational, Williams has the option to increase its ownership up to 50 percent by reimbursing ONEOK Partners for its proportionate share of all construction costs. If Williams exercises its option to increase its ownership to the full 50 percent, Williams would have the option to become operator. Construction of the pipeline is expected to begin in the summer of 2007, with start up scheduled for early 2008. As part of a long term agreement, Williams dedicated its NGL production from two of its gas processing plants in Wyoming to the joint venture company. Subsidiaries of ONEOK Partners will provide downstream fractionation, storage and transportation services to Williams. The pipeline project is estimated to cost approximately $433 million excluding AFUDC. During 2006, ONEOK Partners paid $11.6 million to Williams for acquisition of our interest in the joint venture and for reimbursement of initial capital expenditures. In addition, ONEOK Partners plans to invest approximately $216 million excluding AFUDC to expand its existing fractionation capabilities and the capacity of its natural gas liquids distribution pipelines. ONEOK Partners financing for both projects may include a combination of short or long term debt or equity. The project requires the approval of various state and federal regulatory authorities. In April 2006, we sold certain assets comprising our former gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage segments to ONEOK Partners for approximately $3 billion, including $1.35 billion in cash, before adjustments, and approximately 36.5 million Class B limited partner units in ONEOK Partners. The Class B limited partner units and the related general partner interest contribution were valued at approximately $1.65 billion. We also purchased, through ONEOK Partners GP, from an affiliate of TransCanada, 17.5 percent of the general partner interest in ONEOK Partners for $40 million. This purchase resulted in our owning the entire 2 percent general partner interest in ONEOK Partners. Following the completion of the transactions, we own approximately 37.0 million common and Class B limited partner units and the entire 2 percent ONEOK Partners general partner interest and control of the partnership. Our overall interest in ONEOK Partners, including the 2 percent general partner interest, has increased to 45.7 percent. The sale of certain assets comprising our former gathering and processing, pipelines and storage, and natural gas liquids segments did not affect our consolidated operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income or total assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we were already required under EITF 04 5 to consolidate our investment in ONEOK Partners effective January 1, 2006. However, minority interest expense and net income are affected. See Impact of New Accounting Standards beginning on page 31 for additional discussion of EITF 04 5. In connection with the transactions described immediately above, our ONEOK Partners segment completed the sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline to TC PipeLines for approximately $297 million. Our ONEOK Partners segment recorded a gain on sale of approximately $113.9 million in the second quarter of 2006. ONEOK Partners and TC PipeLines each now own a 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline, with an affiliate of TransCanada 30 Table of Contents becoming operator of the pipeline in April 2007. Beginning January 1, 2006, Northern Border Pipeline is accounted for as an investment under the equity method. TransCanada paid us $10 million for expenses associated with the transfer of operating responsibility of Northern Border Pipeline to them. Also in April 2006, our ONEOK Partners segment acquired the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline not previously owned by ONEOK Partners for approximately $77 million, increasing its ownership interest to 100 percent. ONEOK Partners used borrowings from its credit facility to fund the acquisition of the additional interest in Guardian Pipeline. Following the completion of the transaction, we consolidated Guardian Pipeline in our consolidated financial statements. This change was retroactive to January 1, 2006. In December 2005, we sold our natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas to a subsidiary of Eagle Rock Energy, Inc. for approximately $527.2 million and recorded a pre tax gain of $264.2 million, which is included in gain on sale of assets in our ONEOK Partners segments operating income. The gain reflects the cash received less adjustments, selling expenses and the net book value of the assets sold. We used the net cash proceeds from this sale to prepay our 7.75 percent $300.0 million long term debt that was due in August 2006. In October 2005, we entered into an agreement to sell our Spring Creek power plant, located in Oklahoma, to Westar for $53 million. The transaction received FERC approval and the sale was completed on October 31, 2006. The 300 megawatt gas fired merchant power plant was built in 2001 to supply electrical power during peak periods using gas powered turbine generators. The financial information related to the properties sold is reflected as a discontinued component in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All periods presented have been restated to reflect the discontinued component. In September 2005, we completed the sale of our former production segment to TXOK Acquisition, Inc. for $645 million, before adjustments and recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately $240.3 million. The gain reflects the cash received less adjustments, selling expenses and the net book value of the assets sold. The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce debt. The financial information related to the properties sold is reflected as a discontinued component in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All periods presented have been restated to reflect the discontinued component. In July 2005, we completed the acquisition of the natural gas liquids businesses owned by Koch for approximately $1.33 billion, net of working capital and cash received. This transaction included Koch Hydrocarbon, LPs entire Mid Continent natural gas liquids fractionation business; Koch Pipeline Company, LPs natural gas liquids pipeline distribution systems; Chisholm Pipeline Holdings, Inc., now Chisholm Pipeline Holdings, L.L.C., which has a 50 percent ownership interest in Chisholm Pipeline Company; MBFF, LP, now ONEOK MBI, L.P., which owns an 80 percent interest in a 160,000 barrel per day fractionator at Mont Belvieu, Texas; and Koch Vesco Holdings, LLC, now ONEOK Vesco Holdings, L.L.C., an entity that owns a 10.2 percent interest in VESCO. These assets are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on July 1, 2005. In November 2004, we acquired Northern Plains, now known as ONEOK Partners GP, which then owned 82.5 percent of the general partner interest and approximately 500,000 limited partnership units, together representing a 2.73 percent ownership interest, in Northern Border Partners, L.P., now known as ONEOK Partners, from CCE Holdings, LLC for $175 million. Income derived from this investment was included in other income in our Other segment until January 1, 2006. See Impact of New Accounting Standards below for discussion of consolidation under EITF 04 5. REGULATORY Several regulatory initiatives positively impacted the earnings and future earnings potential for our Distribution segment and our ONEOK Partners segment. See discussion of our Distribution segments regulatory initiative beginning on page 42. IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which was effective for our year ending December 31, 2006, except for the measurement date change from September 30 to December 31 which will not go into effect until our year ending December 31, 2008. Statement 158 requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our plans as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in other comprehensive income (loss) in the year in which the changes occur. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the impact of adoption of Statement 158. 31 Table of Contents Also in September 2006, the FASB issued Statement 157, Fair Value Measurements, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. Statement 157 is effective for our year beginning January 1, 2008. We are currently reviewing the applicability of Statement 157 to our operations and its potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC staff issued SAB Topic 1N, Financial Statements Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), which addresses how to quantify the effect of an error on the financial statements. SAB 108 is effective for our year ended December 31, 2006. We have completed our review of the applicability of SAB 108 to our operations and have determined that it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which is effective for our year beginning January 1, 2007. This interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We are evaluating our tax positions and anticipate FIN 48 will not have a significant impact on our results of operations. In September 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in EITF Issue No. 04 13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty. EITF 04 13 defines when a purchase and a sale of inventory with the same party that operates in the same line of business should be considered a single nonmonetary transaction. EITF 04 13 was effective for new arrangements that a company enters into in periods beginning after March 15, 2006. We completed our review of the applicability of EITF 04 13 to our operations and determined that its impact was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in EITF Issue No. 04 5, which presumes that a general partner controls a limited partnership and therefore should consolidate the partnership in the financial statements of the general partner. Effective January 1, 2006, we were required to consolidate ONEOK Partners operations in our consolidated financial statements, and we elected to use the prospective method. Accordingly, prior period financial statements have not been restated. The adoption of EITF 04 5 did not have an impact on our net income; however, reported revenues, costs and expenses reflect the operating results of ONEOK Partners. Additionally, we recorded a minority interest liability on our 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet to recognize the 54.3 percent of ONEOK Partners that we do not own. We reflect our 45.7 percent share of ONEOK Partners accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2006, in our consolidated accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The remaining 54.3 percent is reflected as an adjustment to minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement 123R, Share Based Payment, which requires companies to expense the fair value of share based payments net of estimated forfeitures. We adopted Statement 123R as of January 1, 2006, and elected to use the modified prospective method. Statement 123R did not have a material impact on our financial statements as we have been expensing share based payments since our adoption of Statement 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, on January 1, 2003. Awards granted after the adoption of Statement 123R are expensed under the requirements of Statement 123R, while equity awards granted prior to the adoption of Statement 123R will continue to be expensed under Statement 148. We recognized other income of $1.7 million upon adoption of Statement 123R. As of December 31, 2006, there was $3.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to our nonvested restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.1 year. There was $10.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to our performance unit awards as of December 31, 2006, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options was not material. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty and that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ. The following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies, which are defined as those policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring managements most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters. 32 Table of Contents We have discussed the development of and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Derivatives and Risk Management Activities We engage in wholesale energy marketing, retail marketing, trading and risk management activities. We account for derivative instruments utilized in connection with these activities and services under the fair value basis of accounting in accordance with Statement 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Under Statement 133, entities are required to record derivative instruments at fair value. The fair value of derivative instruments is determined by commodity exchange prices, over the counter quotes, volatility, time value, counterparty credit and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions. Refer to the table on page 59 for amounts in our portfolio at December 31, 2006, that were determined by prices actively quoted, prices provided by other external sources and prices derived from other sources. The majority of our portfolios fair values are based on actual market prices. Transactions are also executed in markets for which market prices may exist but the market may be relatively inactive, thereby resulting in limited price transparency that requires managements subjectivity in estimating fair values. Market value changes result in a change in the fair value of our derivative instruments. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the reason for holding it. If the derivative instrument does not qualify or is not designated as part of a hedging relationship, then we account for changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings as they occur. Commodity price volatility may have a significant impact on the gain or loss in any given period. For more information on fair value sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. To minimize the risk of fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and condensate prices, we periodically enter into futures, options and swap transactions in order to hedge anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas and condensate, fuel requirements and NGL inventories. Interest rate swaps are also used to manage interest rate risk. Under certain conditions, we designate these derivative instruments as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values or cash flows. For hedges of exposure to changes in cash flow, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently recorded to earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness of designated hedges is reported in earnings in the period the ineffectiveness occurs. For hedges of exposure to changes in fair value, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. Many of our purchase and sale agreements that otherwise would be required to follow derivative accounting qualify as normal purchases and normal sales under Statement 133 and therefore, upon election, are exempt from fair value accounting treatment. Impairment of Long Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets We assess our long lived assets for impairment based on Statement 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. A long lived asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may exceed its fair value. Fair values are based on the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. We assess our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually based on Statement 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In the third quarter of 2006, we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date to July 1. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional discussion. There were no impairment charges resulting from the July 1, 2006, impairment tests and no events indicating an impairment has occurred subsequent to that date. An initial assessment is made by comparing the fair value of the operations with goodwill, as determined in accordance with Statement 142, to the book value of each reporting unit. If the fair value is less than the book value, an impairment is indicated, and we must perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment. In the second test, we calculate the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the operations with goodwill from the fair value determined in step one of the assessment. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds this calculated implied fair value of the goodwill, we will record an impairment charge. As shown below, we had $600.7 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006. 33 Table of Contents (Thousands of dollars) ONEOK Partners $ 431,418 Distribution 157,953 Energy Services 10,255 Other 1,099 Total goodwill $ 600,725 Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life, while intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized. All intangible assets are subject to impairment testing. Our ONEOK Partners segment had $450.7 million of intangible assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006, that consisted of $295.2 million which is being amortized over an aggregate weighted average period of 40 years, while the remaining balance has an indefinite life. During 2006, we recorded a goodwill and asset impairment related to our ONEOK Partners segments Black Mesa Pipeline. For further discussion of this impairment, see page 39. In the third quarter of 2005, we made the decision to sell our Spring Creek power plant, located in Oklahoma, and exit the power generation business. In October 2005, we concluded that our Spring Creek power plant had been impaired and recorded an impairment expense of $52.2 million. This conclusion was based on our Statement 144 impairment analysis of the results of operations for this plant through September 30, 2005, and also the net sales proceeds from the anticipated sale of the plant. The sale was completed on October 31, 2006. This component of our business is accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with Statement 144. Our total unamortized excess cost over underlying fair value of net assets accounted for under the equity method was $185.6 million and $33.4 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Based on Statement 142, this amount, referred to as equity method goodwill, should continue to be recognized in accordance with APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. Accordingly, we included this amount in investment in unconsolidated affiliates on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not currently anticipate any additional goodwill or asset impairments to occur within the next year, but if such events were to occur over the long term, the impact could be significant to our financial condition and results of operations. Pension and Postretirement Employee Benefits We have a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all full time employees and a postretirement employee benefits plan covering most employees who retire under our defined benefit pension plan with at least five years of service. Nonbargaining unit employees hired after December 31, 2004, are not eligible for our defined benefit pension plan; however, they are covered by a profit sharing plan. Nonbargaining unit employees retiring between the ages of 50 and 55, all nonbargaining unit employees hired on or after January 1, 1999, employees who are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers hired after June 30, 2003, and gas union employees hired after July 1, 2004, who elect postretirement medical coverage, pay 100 percent of the retiree premium for participation in the plan. Additionally, any employees who came to us through various acquisitions may be further limited in their eligibility to participate or receive any contributions from us for postretirement medical benefits. Our actuarial consultant calculates the expense and liability related to these plans and uses statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, age and employment periods. In determining the projected benefit obligations and costs, assumptions can change from period to period and result in material changes in the costs and liabilities we recognize. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for our health care plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects. One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease (Thousands of dollars) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 1,858 $ (1,580 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 18,901 $ (16,333 ) 34 Table of Contents During 2006, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $21.6 million related to our defined benefit pension plans and $25.9 million related to postretirement benefits. We estimate that in 2007, we will record net periodic benefit costs of $29.1 million related to our defined benefit pension plan and $26.7 million related to postretirement benefits. In determining our estimated expenses for 2007, our actuarial consultant assumed an 8.75 percent expected return on plan assets and a discount rate of 6.00 percent. A decrease in our expected return on plan assets to 8.50 percent would increase our 2007 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $1.7 million for our defined benefit pension plan and would not have a significant impact on our postretirement benefit plan. A decrease in our assumed discount rate to 5.75 percent would increase our 2007 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $2.2 million for our defined benefit pension plan and $0.8 million for our postretirement benefit plan. For 2007, we anticipate our total contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and postretirement benefit plan to be $5.0 million and $13.4 million, respectively, and the expected benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plan are estimated to be $15.4 million. Contingencies Our accounting for contingencies covers a variety of business activities including contingencies for legal exposures and environmental exposures. We accrue these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with Statement 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We base our estimates on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution. Actual results may differ from our estimates resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on earnings. FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS Consolidated Operations The following table sets forth certain selected financial information for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2006 2005 2004 (Thousands of dollars) Operating revenues, excluding energy trading revenues $ 11,889,307 $ 12,663,550 $ 5,671,714 Energy trading revenues, net 6,797 12,680 113,814 Cost of sales and fuel 10,176,510 11,338,076 4,648,311 Net margin 1,719,594 1,338,154 1,137,217 Operating costs 738,377 619,995 535,512 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 235,543 183,394 158,053 Gain on sale of assets 115,892 264,207 Operating income $ 861,566 $ 798,972 $ 443,652 Equity earnings from investments $ 95,883 $ 2,538 $ 2,401 Minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries $ 222,000 $ $ Operating Results Net margin increased for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to: the consolidation of our investment in ONEOK Partners as required by EITF 04 5, the effect of the natural gas liquids assets acquired from Koch in our ONEOK Partners segment, strong commodity prices, higher gross processing spreads and increased natural gas transportation revenue in our ONEOK Partners segment, and improved natural gas basis differentials on transportation contracts, net of hedging activities, in our Energy Services segment. For an explanation of energy trading revenues, net, see the discussion of our Energy Services segment beginning on page 42. Consolidated operating costs for 2006 increased, compared with 2005, primarily because of consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations and the natural gas liquids assets acquired in 2005, offset by the sale of the Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets in December 2005. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations, the Black Mesa Pipeline impairment, and the costs associated with the natural gas liquids assets acquired from Koch. 35 Table of Contents Operating income for 2006 includes the gain on sale of assets of $113.9 million related to ONEOK Partners sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline to TC PipeLines in April 2006. For additional information, see discussion on page 30. Equity earnings from investments increased $93.3 million in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily as a result of our adoption of EITF 04 5 as of January 1, 2006, which resulted in our consolidation of ONEOK Partners. ONEOK Partners holds various investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including a 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline. Prior to January 1, 2006, ONEOK Partners was accounted for as an investment under the equity method. Minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries, which reflects the remaining 54.3 percent of ONEOK Partners that we do not own, increased $222.0 million in 2006, compared with 2005, as a result of our 2006 adoption of EITF 04 5. Net margin increased for 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to: the effect of increased natural gas basis differentials and natural gas price volatility in our Energy Services segment, the impact of favorable commodity pricing for natural gas and NGL products on our ONEOK Partners segment, the effect of the natural gas liquids assets acquired from Koch in our ONEOK Partners segment, and the implementation of new rate schedules in Oklahoma for our Distribution segment. Consolidated operating costs increased for 2005, compared with 2004, primarily because of costs related to the natural gas liquids assets acquired from Koch and increased employee benefit costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased for 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to the costs associated with the natural gas liquids assets acquired from Koch. Further increases resulted from additional plant, property and equipment in our Distribution segment and regulatory asset amortization resulting from the Kansas Gas Service rate case. Operating income for 2005 includes the gain on sale of assets in our ONEOK Partners segment of $264.2 million. This gain was the result of the sale of certain natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas to a subsidiary of Eagle Rock Energy, Inc. in December 2005. More information regarding our results of operations is provided in the discussion of each segments results. The discontinued component is discussed in our Discontinued Operations and Energy Services segment sections. Key Performance Indicators Key performance indicators reviewed by management include: earnings per share, return on invested capital, and shareholder appreciation. For 2006, our basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.74 and $2.68, respectively, representing a 32 percent decrease in basic earnings per share and a 28 percent decrease in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared with 2005. For 2005, our basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 81 percent and 75 percent, respectively, compared with 2004. Return on invested capital was 14.4 percent in 2006 compared with 23.0 percent in 2005 and 14.3 percent in 2004. The significantly higher earnings per share results in 2005 primarily related to the gain on the sale of our Texas gathering and processing assets which, in addition to the gain on the sale of our production assets, also increased our return on invested capital in 2005. To evaluate shareholder appreciation, we compare ourselves with a group of 20 peer companies. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we ranked first in shareholder appreciation compared with our peers. ONEOK Partners Overview Effective January 1, 2006, we were required to consolidate ONEOK Partners operations in our consolidated financial statements under EITF 04 5, and we elected to use the prospective method, which results in our consolidated financial results and operating information including only 2006 data for the legacy ONEOK Partners operations. In April 2006, we sold certain assets comprising our former gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage segments to ONEOK Partners for approximately $3 billion, including $1.35 billion in cash before adjustments, and approximately 36.5 million Class B limited partner units in ONEOK Partners. These former segments are now included in our ONEOK Partners segment and all periods presented have been restated to reflect this change. We own 45.7 percent of 36 Table of Contents ONEOK Partners; the remaining interest in ONEOK Partners is reflected as minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries on our 2006 Consolidated Statement of Income. ONEOK Partners gathers and processes natural gas and fractionates NGLs primarily in the Mid Continent and Rocky Mountain regions. ONEOK Partners operations include the gathering of natural gas production from crude oil and natural gas wells. Through gathering systems, these volumes are aggregated and treated or processed to remove water vapor, solids and other contaminants and to extract NGLs in order to provide marketable natural gas, commonly referred to as residue gas. When the liquids are separated from the raw natural gas at the processing plants, the liquids are generally in the form of a mixed NGL stream. ONEOK Partners also gathers, stores, fractionates and treats mixed NGLs, and stores NGL purity products produced from gas processing plants located in Oklahoma, Kansas and the Texas panhandle. ONEOK Partners NGL assets connect the NGL production basins in Oklahoma, Kansas and the Texas panhandle with the key NGL market centers in Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas. Most natural gas produced at the wellhead contains a mixture of NGL components such as ethane, propane, iso butane, normal butane and natural gasoline. Natural gas processing plants remove the NGLs from the natural gas stream to realize the higher economic value of the NGLs and to meet natural gas pipeline quality specifications. The NGLs that are separated from the natural gas stream at the natural gas processing plants remain in a mixed, raw form until they are gathered, primarily by pipeline, and delivered to our fractionators. A fractionator, by applying heat and pressure, separates each NGL component into marketable NGL purity products, such as ethane/propane mix, propane, iso butane, normal butane and natural gasoline (collectively NGL purity products). These NGL purity products can then be stored or distributed to petrochemical, heating and motor gasoline manufacturers. ONEOK Partners operates intrastate and FERC regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas storage and FERC regulated and intrastate natural gas liquids gathering and distribution pipelines and nonprocessable natural gas gathering facilities. ONEOK Partners also provides interstate natural gas transportation service under Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act. Acquisition and Divestitures The following acquisition and divestitures are described beginning on page 30. In April 2006, ONEOK Partners completed the sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline to TC PipeLines. ONEOK Partners and TC PipeLines each now own a 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline, with an affiliate of TransCanada becoming operator of the pipeline in April 2007. In December 2005, we sold our natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas. This sale included approximately 3,700 miles of pipe and six processing plants with a capacity of 0.2 Bcf/d. The impact of these assets on our ONEOK Partners segments operating income for the year ended December 31, 2005, was a decrease of $42.0 million. Additionally, we sold approximately 10 miles of non contiguous, natural gas gathering pipelines in Texas. In July 2005, we acquired natural gas liquids businesses from Koch. We also acquired Koch Vesco Holdings, LLC, an entity, which owns a 10.2 percent interest in VESCO. VESCO owns a gas processing complex near Venice, Louisiana. Additionally, we acquired the FERC regulated assets that were part of the acquisition from Koch. Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for our ONEOK Partners segment for the periods indicated.

Operating results We began consolidating our investment in ONEOK Partners as of January 1, 2006, in accordance with EITF 04 5. We elected to use the prospective method, which results in our consolidated financial results and operating information including only 2006 data for the legacy ONEOK Partners operations. See Impact of New Accounting Standards on page 31 for additional information. In April 2006, we sold certain assets comprising our former gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage segments to ONEOK Partners for approximately $3 billion, including $1.35 billion in cash before adjustments, and approximately 36.5 million Class B limited partner units in ONEOK Partners. These former segments are now included in our ONEOK Partners segment. Net margin increased by $294.4 million for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to: an increase of $191.1 million from the legacy ONEOK Partners operations, which were consolidated beginning January 1, 2006, an increase of $101.8 million related to net margins on natural gas liquids gathering and distribution pipelines acquired from Koch in July 2005, an increase of $72.1 million from our legacy operations driven primarily by strong commodity prices, higher gross processing spreads and increased natural gas transportation revenues, and a decrease of $80.5 million resulting from the sale of natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas in December 2005. The increase in operating costs of $103.2 million for 2006, compared with 2005, is primarily related to the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations as of January 1, 2006, and the natural gas liquids assets acquired in 2005, offset by the sale of the Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets in December 2005. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased by $54.6 million for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to $37.9 million related to the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations, $12.0 million for the Black Mesa Pipeline impairment and $15.5 million for the acquisition of natural gas liquids assets from Koch in 2005. These increases were offset by an $8.2 million decrease resulting from the December 2005 sale of natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas. Operating income for 2006 includes the gain on sale of assets of $113.9 million related to ONEOK Partners sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline to TC Pipelines in April 2006. For more information, see discussion on page 30. The increase in equity earnings from investments of $103.5 million for 2006 resulted primarily from ONEOK Partners 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline and gathering and processing joint venture interests in the Powder River and Wind River Basins. 38 Table of Contents The $145.5 million increase in capital expenditures for 2006, compared with 2005, is primarily related to $80.4 million in expenditures by ONEOK Partners legacy operations and $36.7 million in expenditures related to Overland Pass Pipeline Company. The $128.8 million increase in net margin for 2005, compared with 2004, is primarily due to: an increase of $83.8 million related to revenues on natural gas liquids assets acquired in July 2005, an increase of $20.5 million in natural gas transport revenues resulting from increased throughput due to favorable weather conditions for transportation, improved fuel position and significantly higher commodity prices, an increase of $18.8 million attributable to keep whole contracts, net of hedging, due primarily to an increase in gross processing spread, an increase of $8.0 million due to higher natural gas and NGL prices on POP contracts, net of hedging, and an increase of $10.6 million related to increased storage revenues from renegotiated contracts, improved fuel position and higher commodity prices. These increases were partially offset by: a decrease of $6.5 million due to the sale of certain natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas in December 2005 and a decrease of $5.8 million related to lower net margins on equity natural gas inventory sales. The $43.2 million increase in operating costs for 2005, compared with 2004, is primarily due to: increased costs related to the acquired natural gas liquids assets of $33.7 million and higher employee costs and other operating costs offset in part by lower litigation costs as compared with 2004. The increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $17.2 million for 2005, compared with 2004, is primarily related to the newly acquired natural gas liquids pipelines. Operating income for 2005 includes a $264.2 million gain on the sale of the natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas to a subsidiary of Eagle Rock Energy, Inc. in December 2005. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information. The decrease in equity earnings from investments for 2005, compared with 2004, is primarily due to an impairment of $5.9 million recognized in 2005 related to a 50 percent equity investment in an Oklahoma gas plant that ONEOK Partners does not operate and a $2.6 million impairment charge related to one of its gas gathering partnerships. The increase in capital expenditures for 2005, compared with 2004, is primarily related to well connects and additional compression expenditures. Risk Management ONEOK Partners uses commodity financial instruments, including NYMEX contracts, fixed price swaps and collars, which are primarily designated as cash flow hedges, to minimize earnings volatility related to natural gas, NGLs and condensate price fluctuations. The realized financial impact of the derivative transactions is included in our ONEOK Partners segments operating income in the period that the physical transaction occurs. The following table sets forth hedging information for 2007 for our ONEOK Partners segment.

Black Mesa Pipeline On December 31, 2005, our ONEOK Partners segments Black Mesa Pipelines transportation contract with the coal supplier of Mohave Generating Station (Mohave) expired and its coal slurry pipeline operations were shut down as expected. In June 2006, SCE completed a comprehensive study of the water source, coal supply and transportation issues and announced that it would no longer pursue the resumption of plant operations. In February 2007, 39 Table of Contents another Mohave co owner, Salt River Project, announced it was ending its efforts to return the plant to service. Negotiations between various parties involved with Black Mesa Pipeline are ongoing. During the second quarter of 2006, ONEOK Partners assessed its coal slurry pipeline operation in accordance with its accounting policies related to goodwill and asset impairment. Its evaluation of the Black Mesa Pipeline indicated a goodwill and asset impairment of $8.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively, which were recorded as depreciation and amortization in the second quarter of 2006. The reduction to our net income, net of minority interest and income taxes, was $3.0 million. Distribution Overview Our Distribution segment provides natural gas distribution services to over two million customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas through Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service, respectively. We serve residential, commercial, industrial and transportation customers in all three states. In addition, our distribution companies in Oklahoma and Kansas serve wholesale customers, and in Texas we serve public authority customers.

Operating costs increased $11.1 million for 2006, compared with 2005, due to: an increase of $17.2 million in labor and employee benefit costs, an increase of $1.7 million due to increased property taxes, and a decrease of $7.6 million in bad debt expense. Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $2.6 million for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to: a decrease of $2.8 million in cathodic protection and service line amortization in Oklahoma from a limited issue rider which expired in the second quarter of 2005, a decrease of $2.9 million related to the replacement of our field customer service system in Texas during the first quarter of 2005, and an offsetting increase of $2.3 million for depreciation expense related to our investment in property, plant and equipment. Net margin increased $30.4 million for 2005, compared with 2004, due to: an increase of $28.2 million resulting from the implementation of new rate schedules in Oklahoma, an increase of $2.3 million resulting from increased wholesale transactions in Kansas, an increase of $4.9 million due to the ad valorem tax recovery rider, which is offset in amortization expense, and an offsetting decrease of $5.2 million in customer sales volumes due to warmer weather. 40 Table of Contents Operating costs increased $18.7 million for 2005, compared with 2004, due to: an increase of $12.5 million in labor and employee benefit costs, an increase of $2.0 million in bad debt expense, and an increase of $3.2 million due to equipment leasing costs, higher vehicle fuel costs, and an insurance deductible related to Hurricane Rita. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $8.0 million for 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to: an increase of $2.9 million related to the replacement of our field customer service system in Texas, an increase of $3.5 million related to our investment in property, plant and equipment, an increase of $4.9 million due to amortization of the ad valorem tax recovery rider in Kansas, and an offsetting decrease of $3.2 million in pension expense amortization in Oklahoma which expired in 2004. Selected Operating Data The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for our Distribution segment for the periods indicated.

Residential, commercial and industrial volumes decreased in 2005, compared with 2004, due to warmer weather, which primarily affects residential and commercial customers, as well as commercial customers migrating to new transportation rates as a result of lower minimum thresholds in Oklahoma. Wholesale sales represent contracted natural gas volumes that exceed the needs of our residential, commercial and industrial customer base and are available for sale to other parties. Wholesale volumes decreased for 2006, compared with 2005, due to reduced volumes available for sale. 41 Table of Contents Public authority natural gas volumes reflect volumes used by state agencies and school districts served by Texas Gas Service. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditure program includes expenditures for extending service to new areas, modifying customer service lines, increasing system capabilities, general replacements and improvements. It is our practice to maintain and periodically upgrade facilities to assure safe, reliable and efficient operations. Our capital expenditure program included $54.9 million, $38.6 million and $35.0 million for new business development in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Increased new customer installation in the Austin and El Paso areas of Texas and the Tulsa and Oklahoma City areas of Oklahoma were primarily responsible for the increase in new business capital expenditures during 2006, compared with 2005. Regulatory Initiatives Oklahoma On October 4, 2005, the OCC issued a final order on our application for a rate increase by Oklahoma Natural Gas. The OCC unanimously approved an annual rate increase of $57.5 million. The Commissions administrative law judge had recommended an increase in annual revenues of approximately $58.0 million in July 2005. Oklahoma Natural Gas implemented new rates, subject to refund, on July 28, 2005, based on the judges report. Kansas In May 2006, Kansas Gas Service announced that it filed a request with the KCC to increase its annual revenues by $73.3 million. Since its last rate case in 2003, Kansas Gas Service had invested approximately $170 million in its natural gas distribution system to provide service for 642,000 Kansas customers. This was the companys first rate increase request in three years. The KCC had 240 days to issue a ruling on Kansas Gas Services application. In October 2006, Kansas Gas Service reached a settlement with the KCC staff and all other involved parties to increase annual revenues by approximately $52 million. The terms of the settlement were approved by the KCC in November 2006. The rate increase was effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2007. On June 24, 2005, the KCC issued an order authorizing the inclusion of the natural gas cost component of uncollectible customer accounts in rates for cost recovery. Kansas Gas Service began deferring the natural gas cost component of uncollectible accounts in July 2005 and began recovery in August 2006. Texas Texas Gas Service has received several regulatory approvals to implement rate increases in various municipalities in Texas. A total of $5.5 million in annual rate increases were approved and implemented in 2006. Bargaining Unit On October 25, 2006, a four year labor contract was ratified between Kansas Gas Service and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The contract will expire on June 30, 2010. General Certain costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process have been recorded as regulatory assets in accordance with Statement 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Should recovery cease due to regulatory actions, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria of Statement 71 and, accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. Energy Services Overview Our Energy Services segments primary focus is to create value for our customers by delivering physical natural gas products and risk management services through our network of contracted transportation and storage capacity and natural gas supply. These services include meeting our customers baseload, swing and peaking natural gas commodity requirements on a year round basis. To provide these bundled services, we lease storage and transportation capacity. Our total storage capacity under lease is 86 Bcf, with maximum withdrawal capability of 2.2 Bcf/d and maximum injection capability of 1.5 Bcf/d. Our current transportation capacity is 1.8 Bcf/d. Our contracted storage and transportation capacity connects the major supply and demand centers throughout the United States and into Canada. With these contracted assets, our business strategies include identifying, developing and delivering specialized services and products for value to our customers, which are primarily LDCs, electric utilities, and commercial and industrial end users. Also, our storage and transportation capacity allows us opportunities to optimize these positions through our application of market knowledge and risk management skills. Our Energy Services segment regularly conducts business with ONEOK Partners, our 45.7 percent owned affiliate, which comprises our ONEOK Partners segment. This segment also conducts business with our Distribution segment. These services are provided under agreements with market based terms. Due to seasonality of natural gas consumption, earnings are normally higher during the winter months than the summer months. Our Energy Services segments margins are subject to fluctuations during the year primarily due to the impact certain seasonal factors have on sales volumes and the price of natural gas. Natural gas sales volumes are typically higher in 42 Table of Contents the winter heating months than in the summer months, reflecting increased demand due to greater heating requirements and, typically, higher natural gas prices that occur during the winter heating months. During periods of high natural gas demand, we utilize storage capacity to supplement natural gas supply volumes to meet peak day demand obligations or market needs. We manage our contracted transportation and storage capacity by utilizing derivative instruments such as over the counter forward, swap and option contracts and NYMEX futures and option contracts. We apply a combination of cash flow and fair value hedge accounting when implementing hedging strategies that take advantage of existing market conditions. See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information. Additionally, certain hedging activity will not qualify for hedge or accrual accounting treatment; therefore, these non trading transactions are economic hedges of our accrual transactions. These economic hedges receive mark to market accounting treatment, as they are derivative contracts and are not designated as part of a hedge relationship. Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for our Energy Services segment for the periods indicated. In the third quarter of 2005, we made the decision to sell our Spring Creek power plant, located in Oklahoma, and exit the power generation business. In October 2005, we concluded that our Spring Creek power plant had been impaired and recorded an impairment expense of $52.2 million. The transaction received FERC approval, and the sale was completed on October 31, 2006. This component of our business is accounted for as discontinued operations, in accordance with Statement 144. The discontinued operations are excluded from the financial and operating results below. For additional information, see discussion of discontinued operations on page 45. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2006 2005 2004 (Thousands of dollars) Energy and power revenues $ 6,328,893 $ 8,345,091 $ 2,720,629 Energy trading revenues, net 6,797 12,680 113,814 Other revenues 117 980 849 Cost of sales and fuel 6,061,989 8,152,391 2,661,286 Net margin 273,818 206,360 174,006 Operating costs 42,464 38,719 33,370 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,149 2,071 1,554 Operating income $ 229,205 $ 165,570 $ 139,082 Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2006 2005 2004 Natural gas marketed (Bcf) 1,132 1,191 1,073 Natural gas gross margin ($/Mcf) $ 0.22 $ 0.14 $ 0.14 Physically settled volumes (Bcf) 2,288 2,387 2,157 Capital expenditures (Thousands of dollars) $ $ 159 $ 1,806 Operating Results Net margin increased $67.5 million for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to: an increase of $58.0 million in transportation margins, net of hedging activities, primarily due to improved natural gas basis differentials between Mid Continent and Gulf Coast regions, an increase of $7.1 million in our natural gas trading operations primarily associated with favorable basis spread and fixed price movement in our basis trading and fixed price portfolios, a net increase of $0.9 million related to storage and marketing margins primarily due to: an increase of $7.1 million due to improved physical storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, and increased demand fees and optimization activities associated with peaking services, partially offset by, a decrease of $6.2 million related to power margins associated with a tolling transaction that expired December 31, 2005, and an increase of $1.5 million in retail activities due to improved physical margins. Operating costs increased $3.7 million in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to increased employee related costs. 43 Table of Contents Net margin increased $32.4 million for 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to: an increase of $41.9 million in transportation margins, net of economic hedges, due to improved natural gas basis differentials primarily in the fourth quarter of 2005 associated with certain capacity held in the Mid Continent region, an increase of $29.4 million in marketing margins due to: an increase of $22.6 million in wholesale physical marketing margins resulting from favorable natural gas price volatility primarily in the fourth quarter of 2005, and an increase of $6.8 million in power trading margins related to improved Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market heat rates attributable to a 13.2 percent increase in cooling degree days compared to normal and a 10.0 percent increase in cooling days compared with the same period in 2004. These increases in net margin were partially offset by: a net decrease of $18.3 million in storage margins from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness primarily related to natural gas basis movements attributable to anticipated storage withdrawals from the 2006/2007 heating season, a decrease of $18.4 million resulting from less favorable price movements in 2005 related to our natural gas fixed price activities, and a decrease of $2.2 million in retail activities related to reduced physical margins. The $5.3 million increase in operating costs in 2005, compared with 2004, is primarily due to increased employee related costs of $1.3 million and increased legal costs of $2.9 million. Natural gas volumes marketed decreased for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to higher storage injections in the second and third quarters of 2006; warmer temperatures in the majority of our service territory in the first and fourth quarters of 2006; and decreased sales in our Canadian operations. Natural gas volumes increased in 2005, compared with 2004, due to our expanded Canadian operations, additional long term transportation contracts and opportunities to sell into supply constrained markets. Our natural gas in storage at December 31, 2006, was 74.1 Bcf, compared with 62.1 Bcf at December 31, 2005. At both December 31, 2006 and 2005, our total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 86 Bcf. The acquisition of natural gas storage capacity has become more competitive as a result of new entrants from the financial services sector, the increase in the spread between summer and winter natural gas prices, and natural gas price volatility. The increased demand for storage capacity has resulted in an increase in both the cost of leasing storage capacity and the required term of the lease. Longer terms for our storage capacity leases could result in significant increases in our contractual commitments. At the beginning of the third quarter of 2004, we completed a reorganization of our Energy Services segment and renewed our focus on our physical marketing and storage business. We separated the management and operations of our wholesale marketing, retail marketing and trading activities and began accounting separately for the different types of revenue earned from these activities. Prior to the third quarter of 2004, we managed our Energy Services segment on an integrated basis and presented all energy trading activity on a net basis. Concurrent with this reorganization, we evaluated the accounting treatment related to the presentation of revenues from the different types of activities to determine which amounts should be reported on a gross or net basis under the guidance in EITF Issue No. 03 11, Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not Held for Trading Purposes as Defined in EITF Issue No. 02 3. For derivative instruments considered held for trading purposes that result in physical delivery, the indicators in EITF Issue No. 02 3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities were used to determine the proper treatment. These activities and all financially settled derivative contracts will continue to be reported on a net basis. For derivative instruments that are not considered held for trading purposes and that result in physical delivery, the indicators in EITF 03 11 and EITF Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent were used to determine the proper treatment. We began accounting for the realized revenues and purchase costs of these contracts that result in physical delivery on a gross basis beginning with the third quarter of 2004. We apply the indicators in EITF 99 19 to determine the appropriate accounting treatment for non derivative contracts that result in physical delivery. Derivatives that qualify for the normal purchase or sale exception as defined in Statement 133 are also reported on a gross basis. Prior periods have not been adjusted for this change; therefore, comparisons to prior periods may not be meaningful. Reporting of these transactions on a gross basis did not impact operating income but resulted in an increase to revenues and cost of sales and fuel. 44 Table of Contents The following table shows the margins by activity, beginning with our reorganization on July 1, 2004. Year EndedDecember 31, 2006 Year EndedDecember 31, 2005 Six Months EndedDecember 31, 2004 (Thousands of dollars) Marketing and storage, gross $ 414,951 $ 350,227 $ 126,989 Less: Storage and transportation costs (180,708 ) (174,838 ) (72,661 ) Marketing and storage, net 234,243 175,389 54,328 Retail marketing 19,006 17,526 8,628 Financial trading 20,569 13,445 23,221 Net margin $ 273,818 $ 206,360 $ 86,177 Marketing and storage activities, net, primarily include physical marketing, purchases and sales, firm storage and transportation capacity expense, including the impact of cash flow and fair value hedges, and other derivative instruments used to manage our risk associated with these activities. The combination of owning supply, controlling strategic assets and risk management services allows us to provide commodity diverse products and services to our customers such as peaking and load following services. Retail marketing includes revenues from providing physical marketing and supply services coupled with risk management services to residential and small commercial and industrial customers. Financial trading margin includes activities that are generally executed using financially settled derivatives. These activities are normally short term in nature, with a focus of capturing short term price volatility. Energy trading revenues, net, in our Consolidated Income Statements includes financial trading margins, as well as certain physical natural gas transactions with our trading counterparties. Revenues and cost of sales and fuel from such physical transactions are required to be reported on a net basis. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Overview In September 2005, we completed the sale of our former production segment to TXOK Acquisition, Inc. for $645 million, before adjustments, and recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately $240.3 million. The gain reflects the cash received less adjustments, selling expenses and the net book value of the assets sold. The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce debt. Our Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale in July 2005, which resulted in our former production segment being classified as held for sale beginning July 1, 2005. In accordance with Statement 144, we did not record any depreciation, depletion or amortization for our former production segment while it was classified as held for sale. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2005, we made the decision to sell our Spring Creek power plant, located in Oklahoma, and exit the power generation business. In October 2005, we concluded that our Spring Creek power plant had been impaired and recorded an impairment expense of $52.2 million. We subsequently entered into an agreement to sell our Spring Creek power plant to Westar for $53 million. The transaction received FERC approval and the sale was completed on October 31, 2006. The 300 megawatt gas fired merchant power plant was built in 2001 to supply electrical power during peak periods using gas powered turbine generators. These components of our business are accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with Statement 144. Accordingly, amounts in our financial statements and related notes for all periods shown relating to our former production segment and our power generation business are reflected as discontinued operations. The sale of our former production segment and the sale of our power generation business are in line with our business strategy to sell assets when deemed to be less strategic or as other conditions warrant. 45 Table of Contents Selected Financial Information The amounts of revenue, costs and income taxes reported in discontinued operations are shown in the table below for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Thousands of dollars) Operating revenues $ 10,646 $ 135,213 $ 202,552 Cost of sales and fuel 7,393 38,398 95,524 Net margin 3,253 96,815 107,028 Impairment expense 52,226 Operating costs 837 24,302 29,997 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 17,919 30,673 Operating income 2,416 2,368 46,358 Other income (expense), net 252 60 Interest expense 3,013 12,588 16,167 Income taxes (232 ) (3,788 ) 12,746 Income (loss) from operations of discontinued components, net $ (365 ) $ (6,180 ) $ 17,505 Gain on sale of discontinued components, net of tax of $90.7 million $ $ 149,577 $ LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES General Part of our strategy is to grow through strategic acquisitions that strengthen and complement our existing assets. We have relied primarily on operating cash flow, borrowings from commercial paper and credit agreements, and issuance of debt and equity in the capital markets for our liquidity and capital resource requirements. We expect to continue to use these sources for liquidity and capital resource needs on both a short and long term basis. We have no material guarantees of debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated parties. During 2006 and 2005, our capital expenditures were financed through operating cash flows and short and long term debt. Capital expenditures for 2006 were $376 million, compared with $250 million in 2005, exclusive of acquisitions. Financing Financing is provided through available cash, our commercial paper program and long term debt. We also have credit agreements, as discussed below, which are used as a back up for the commercial paper program and short term liquidity needs. Other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuance of equity, issuance of mandatory convertible debt securities, issuance of trust preferred securities by ONEOK Capital Trust I or ONEOK Capital Trust II, asset securitization and sale/leaseback of facilities. ONEOK Partners operations are also financed through operating cash flow, credit agreements and the issuance of debt and limited partner units. The total amount of short term borrowings authorized by our Board of Directors is $2.5 billion. In addition to the short term bridge financing agreement discussed below, the total amount of short term borrowings authorized by the Board of Directors of ONEOK Partners GP, the general partner of ONEOK Partners, is $750 million, and an additional $10 million is authorized for Guardian Pipeline. At December 31, 2006, we had no commercial paper outstanding, $58.5 million in letters of credit issued and available cash and temporary investments of approximately $78.3 million. At December 31, 2006, ONEOK Partners had $10 million in letters of credit issued, no borrowings outstanding under the five year $750 million amended and restated revolving credit agreement (2006 Partnership Credit Agreement), and available cash of approximately $21.1 million. As of December 31, 2006, we could have issued $2.6 billion of additional debt under the most restrictive provisions contained in our various borrowing agreements. As of December 31, 2006, ONEOK Partners could have issued, under the most restrictive provisions of its agreements, $1.5 billion of additional debt. Currently, we have $48.2 million available under a shelf registration statement on Form S 3, for the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, debt securities, preferred stock, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units. ONEOK Short Term Bridge Financing Agreement On July 1, 2005, we borrowed $1.0 billion under a new short term bridge financing agreement to assist in financing our acquisition of assets from Koch. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information about this acquisition. We funded the remaining acquisition cost through our commercial paper program. During 2006, we repaid the facility in full, and it was terminated according to its terms. 46 Table of Contents ONEOK Five Year Credit Agreement In April 2006, we amended our 2004 $1.2 billion five year credit agreement to accommodate the transaction with ONEOK Partners. This amendment included changes to the material adverse effect representation, the burdensome agreement representation and the covenant regarding maintenance of control of ONEOK Partners. In July 2006, we amended and restated our 2004 $1.2 billion five year credit agreement. The amended agreement includes revised pricing, an extension of the maturity date from 2009 to 2011, an option for additional extensions of the maturity date with the consent of the lenders, and an option to request an increase in the commitments of the lenders of up to an additional $500 million. The interest rates applicable to extensions of credit under this agreement are based, at our election, on either (i) the higher of prime or one half of one percent above the Federal Funds Rate, which is the rate that banks charge each other for the overnight borrowing of funds, or (ii) the Eurodollar rate plus a set number of basis points based on our current long term unsecured debt ratings. Under the five year credit agreement we are required to comply with certain financial, operational and legal covenants. Among other things, these requirements include: a $500 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit, a limitation on our debt to capital ratio, which may not exceed 67.5 percent at the end of any calendar quarter, a requirement that we maintain the power to control the management and policies of ONEOK Partners, and a limit on new investments in master limited partnerships. The debt covenant calculations in our five year credit agreement exclude the debt of ONEOK Partners. At December 31, 2006, we had no borrowings outstanding under this agreement. Our five year credit agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants relating to liens, investments, fundamental changes in our businesses, changes in the nature of our businesses, transactions with affiliates, the use of proceeds and a covenant that prevents us from restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends. At December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with these covenants. ONEOK Uncommitted Line of Credit We have a credit agreement with a commercial bank that gives us access to an uncommitted line of credit for loans and letters of credit up to a maximum principal amount of $15 million. The rate charged on any outstanding amount is the higher of prime or one half of one percent above the Federal Funds overnight rate, which is the rate that banks charge each other for the overnight borrowing of funds. This agreement remains in effect until canceled by the commercial bank or us. This agreement does not contain any covenants more restrictive than those in our $1.2 billion five year credit agreement. This credit agreement is used to issue a $15.0 million standby letter of credit. 2006 Partnership Credit Agreement In December 2006, ONEOK Partners amended its 2006 Partnership Credit Agreement. This agreement now provides for the exclusion of hybrid securities from debt in an amount not to exceed 15 percent of total capitalization when calculating the leverage ratio. Material projects may now be approved by the administrative agent as opposed to requiring approval from 50 percent of the lenders. The methodology of making pro forma adjustments to EBITDA (net income before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization) that is used in the calculation of the financial covenants with respect to approved material projects was also amended. The amendment excluded the Overland Pass Pipeline Company agreement from the covenant that limits ONEOK Partners ability to enter into agreements that restrict its ability to grant liens to the lenders under the 2006 Partnership Credit Agreement. In March 2006, ONEOK Partners amended and restated its 2005 revolving credit agreement with certain financial institutions and increased the term for an additional five years, increased the facility to $750 million from $500 million, and lowered the pricing. The 2005 revolving credit agreement, as amended and restated, is referred to as the 2006 Partnership Credit Agreement. Under the 2006 Partnership Credit Agreement, ONEOK Partners is required to comply with certain financial, operational and legal covenants. Among other things, these requirements include: maintaining a ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for pro forma operating results of acquisitions made during the year) of no more than 4.75 to 1, and maintaining a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of greater than 3 to 1. If ONEOK Partners consummates one or more acquisitions in which the aggregate purchase price is $25 million or more, the allowable ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA will be increased to 5.25 to 1 for two calendar quarters following the acquisitions. Upon any breach of these covenants, amounts outstanding under the 2006 Partnership Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2006, ONEOK Partners was in compliance with these covenants. 47 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, a $10 million letter of credit was outstanding under the 2006 Partnership Credit Agreement. The letter of credit expires May 1, 2007. ONEOK Partners Bridge Facility In April 2006, ONEOK Partners entered into a $1.1 billion 364 day credit facility (Bridge Facility) with a syndicate of banks and borrowed $1.05 billion to finance a portion of its purchase of certain assets comprising our former gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage segments. In September 2006, ONEOK Partners repaid the amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility using proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, which resulted in the Bridge Facility being terminated according to its terms. See ONEOK Partners Debt Issuance below and Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion regarding the issuance of senior notes. ONEOK Partners Debt Issuance In September 2006, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of (i) $350 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90 percent Senior Notes due 2012 (the 2012 Notes), (ii) $450 million aggregate principal amount of 6.15 percent Senior Notes due 2016 (the 2016 Notes) and (iii) $600 million aggregate principal amount of 6.65 percent Senior Notes due 2036 (the 2036 Notes and collectively with the 2012 Notes and the 2016 Notes, the Notes). ONEOK Partners registered the sale of the Notes with the SEC pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed on September 19, 2006. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Intermediate Partnership. The guarantee ranks equally in right of payment to all of the Intermediate Partnerships existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. ONEOK Partners may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued interest and a make whole premium. The redemption price will never be less than 100 percent of the principal amount of the relevant Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with all of ONEOK Partners existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, and effectively junior to all of the existing debt and other liabilities of its non guarantor subsidiaries. The Notes are non recourse to us. The net proceeds from the Notes of approximately $1.39 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses, but before offering expenses, were used to repay all of the amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility and to repay $335 million of indebtedness outstanding under the 2006 Partnership Credit Agreement. The terms of the Notes are governed by the Indenture, dated as of September 25, 2006, between ONEOK Partners and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture (with respect to the 2012 Notes), the Second Supplemental Indenture (with respect to the 2016 Notes) and the Third Supplemental Indenture (with respect to the 2036 Notes), each dated September 25, 2006. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of debt securities that may be issued and provides that debt securities may be issued from time to time in one or more additional series. The Indenture contains covenants including, among other provisions, limitations on ONEOK Partners ability to place liens on its property or assets and sell and lease back its property. The 2012 Notes, 2016 Notes and 2036 Notes will mature on April 1, 2012, October 1, 2016, and October 1, 2036, respectively. ONEOK Partners will pay interest on the Notes on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The first payment of interest on the Notes will be made on April 1, 2007. Interest on the Notes accrues from September 25, 2006, which was the issuance date of the Notes. Guardian Pipeline Senior Notes ONEOK Partners acquisition of the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline not previously owned by ONEOK Partners resulted in the inclusion of $145.6 million of long term debt in our 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet. These notes were issued under a master shelf agreement with certain financial institutions. Principal payments are due quarterly through 2022. Interest rates on the notes range from 7.61 percent to 8.27 percent, with an average rate of 7.86 percent. Guardian Pipelines senior notes contain financial covenants that require the maintenance of a ratio of (1) EBITDAR (net income plus interest expense, income taxes, operating lease expense and depreciation and amortization) to the sum of interest expense plus operating lease expense of not less than 1.5 to 1 and (2) total indebtedness to EBITDAR of not greater than 6.75 to 1. Upon any breach of these covenants, all amounts outstanding under the master shelf agreement may become due and payable immediately. Beginning in December 2007, the rate of total indebtedness to EBITDAR may not be greater than 5.75 to 1. At December 31, 2006, Guardian Pipeline was in compliance with its financial covenants. Equity Units On February 16, 2006, we successfully settled our 16.1 million equity units with 19.5 million shares of our common stock. Of this amount, 8.3 million shares were issued from treasury stock and approximately 11.2 million shares were newly issued. Holders of the equity units received 1.2119 shares of our common stock for each equity unit they owned. The number of shares that we issued for each stock purchase contract was determined based on our average closing price 48 Table of Contents over the 20 trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to February 16, 2006. With the settlement, we received $402.4 million in cash, which was used to pay down our short term bridge financing agreement. Capitalization Structure The following table sets forth our consolidated capitalization structure for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Long term debt 65 % 53 % Equity 35 % 47 % Debt (including Notes payable) 65 % 67 % Equity 35 % 33 % We do not guarantee the debt of ONEOK Partners. For purposes of determining compliance with financial covenants in our five year credit agreement, the debt of ONEOK Partners is excluded. At December 31, 2006, our capitalization structure, excluding the debt of ONEOK Partners, was 48 percent long term debt and 52 percent equity, compared with 53 percent long term debt and 47 percent equity at December 31, 2005. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2006, were as follows: ONEOK ONEOK Partners Rating Agency Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Moodys Baa2 Stable Baa2 Stable S&P BBB Stable BBB Stable Fitch (a ) (a ) BBB Stable (a) Fitch does not rate ONEOK, Inc. debt. Our credit ratings may be affected by a material change in our financial ratios or a material event affecting our business. The most common criteria for assessment of our credit ratings are the debt to capital ratio, business risk profile, pretax and after tax interest coverage, and liquidity. If our credit ratings were downgraded, the interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings would increase, resulting in an increase in our cost to borrow funds, and we could potentially lose access to the commercial paper market. In the event that ONEOK is unable to borrow funds under our commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in our business, we have access to a $1.2 billion five year credit agreement, which expires July 2011, and ONEOK Partners has access to a $750 million revolving credit agreement, which allows for an option to increase the commitments of the lenders up to an additional $250 million that expires March 2011. ONEOK Partners $250 million and $225 million long term notes payable, due 2010 and 2011, respectively, contain provisions that require ONEOK Partners to offer a repurchase of the senior notes at par value if the Moodys and S&P debt ratings fall below investment grade (Baa3 for Moodys and BBB for S&P) and the investment grade ratings are not reinstated within a period of 40 days. Further, the indentures governing ONEOK Partners senior notes due 2010 and 2011 include an event of default upon acceleration of other indebtedness of $25 million or more and the indentures governing the senior notes due 2012, 2016 and 2036 include an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of $100 million or more that would be triggered by such an offer to repurchase. Such an event of default would entitle the trustee or the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior notes due 2010, 2011, 2012, 2016 and 2036 to declare those notes immediately due and payable in full. ONEOK Partners may not have sufficient cash on hand to repurchase and repay any accelerated senior notes, which may cause it to borrow money under its credit facilities or seek alternative financing sources to finance the repurchases and repayment. ONEOK Partners could also face difficulties accessing capital or its borrowing costs could increase, impacting its ability to obtain financing for acquisitions or capital expenditures, to refinance indebtedness and to fulfill its debt obligations. Our Energy Services segment relies upon the investment grade rating of our senior unsecured long term debt to satisfy credit requirements with most of our counterparties. If our credit ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to participate in energy marketing and trading activities could be significantly limited. Without an investment grade rating, we may be required to fund margin requirements with our counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments. A decline in our credit rating below investment grade may also significantly impact other business segments. At December 31, 2006, we could have been required to fund approximately $54.5 million for counterparties with which we have a Credit Support Annex according to our International Swaps and Derivatives Association Agreements. 49 Table of Contents Other than the note repurchase obligations and the margin requirement for our Energy Services segment described above, we have determined that we do not have significant exposure to the rating triggers under our commercial paper agreement, trust indentures, building leases, equipment leases, marketing, trading and risk contracts, and other various contracts. Rating triggers are defined as provisions that would create an automatic default or acceleration of indebtedness based on a change in our credit rating. ONEOKs credit agreements contain provisions that would cause the cost to borrow funds to increase if our credit rating is negatively adjusted. ONEOK Partners credit agreements have similar provisions. An adverse rating change is not defined as a default of our credit agreements. ONEOK Partners Class B Units The limited partner units we received from ONEOK Partners were newly created Class B units which are presently subordinated to the common units with respect to the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution, which is $0.55 per unit, and thereafter, have the same right to receive minimum quarterly distributions as those received by the holders of the common units. If distributions to all unitholders exceed $0.55 per unit, the holders of common units and holders of the Class B units receive the same distribution per unit. The Class B units have limited voting rights. Distributions on the Class B units were prorated from the date of issuance. ONEOK Partners is required to hold a special election for holders of common units as soon as practical, but no later than April 2007, subject to extension, to approve the conversion of the Class B units into common units and to approve certain amendments to ONEOK Partners partnership agreement. ONEOK Partners will hold a special election for holders of common units on March 29, 2007, subject to adjournment, to approve the conversion of the Class B units into common units and to approve certain amendments to its partnership agreement. The proposed amendments to its partnership agreement would grant voting rights for common units held by its general partner if a vote is held to remove its general partner and require fair market value compensation for the general partner interest if the general partner is removed. If the conversion and the amendments are approved by the common unitholders, the Class B units will automatically be eligible to convert into common units on a one for one basis and the Class B units will no longer be outstanding. If the common unitholders do not approve both the conversion and amendments, then the amount payable on such Class B units would increase to 110 percent of the distributions paid on the common units, including distributions paid upon liquidation. If the common unitholders vote to remove us or our affiliates as the general partner of ONEOK Partners at any time prior to the approval of the conversion and amendment described above, the amount payable on such Class B units would increase to 123.5 percent of the distributions payable with respect to the common units, and 125 percent of the distributions paid upon liquidation. The Class B unit distribution rights would continue to be subordinated to the common units with respect to the minimum quarterly distributions unless and until the conversion described above has been approved. Capital Projects In June 2006, ONEOK Partners signed a non binding letter of intent to form a joint venture with Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP and Energy Transfer Partners, LP to construct a new interstate pipeline originating in north Texas, crossing Oklahoma and Arkansas and terminating in Coahoma, Mississippi at a new interconnect with Texas Gas Transmission, L.L.C. The proposed interstate pipeline would have created new pipeline capacity for constrained wellhead production in north Texas and central Oklahoma and would have initial capacity of up to 1.0 Bcf/d. In August 2006, Energy Transfer Partners, LP withdrew from the joint venture. In 2007, ONEOK Partners withdrew from the letter of intent, but continues to work with Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP and others to determine the feasibility of a project to deliver incremental natural gas volumes to Texas Gas Transmission L.L.C. Any transaction is still subject to negotiation and execution of definitive agreements. In May 2006, a subsidiary of ONEOK Partners entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Williams to form a joint venture called Overland Pass Pipeline Company, for the purpose of building a 750 mile natural gas liquids pipeline from Opal, Wyoming, to the Mid Continent natural gas liquids market center in Conway, Kansas. The pipeline will be designed to transport approximately 110,000 Bbl/d of NGLs, which can be increased to approximately 150,000 Bbl/d with additional pump facilities. A subsidiary of ONEOK Partners owns 99 percent of the joint venture, will manage the construction project, will advance all costs associated with construction and will operate the pipeline. Within two years of the pipeline becoming operational, Williams has the option to increase its ownership up to 50 percent by reimbursing ONEOK Partners for its proportionate share of all construction costs. If Williams exercises its option to increase its ownership to the full 50 percent, Williams would have the option to become operator. Construction of the pipeline is expected to begin in the summer of 2007, with start up scheduled for early 2008. As part of a long term agreement, Williams dedicated its NGL production from two of its gas processing plants in Wyoming to the joint venture company. Subsidiaries of ONEOK Partners will provide downstream fractionation, storage and transportation services to Williams. The pipeline project is estimated to cost approximately $433 million excluding AFUDC. During 2006, ONEOK Partners paid $11.6 million to Williams for acquisition of our interest in the joint venture and for reimbursement of initial capital expenditures. In addition, ONEOK Partners plans to invest approximately $216 million excluding AFUDC to expand its existing fractionation capabilities and the capacity of its natural gas liquids distribution pipelines. ONEOK Partners financing for both projects may include a 50 Table of Contents combination of short or long term debt or equity. The project requires the approval of various state and federal regulatory authorities. In October 2006, Guardian Pipeline, a subsidiary of ONEOK Partners, filed its application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the FERC for authorization to construct and operate approximately 110 miles of new mainline pipe, two compressor stations, seven meter stations and other associated facilities. The pipeline expansion will extend Guardian Pipeline from the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area to the Green Bay, Wisconsin area. The project is supported by long term shipper commitments. The cost of the project is estimated to be $241 million excluding AFUDC, with a targeted in service date of November 2008. In March 2006, Midwestern Gas Transmission, a subsidiary of ONEOK Partners, accepted the certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the FERC for its Eastern Extension Project. An organization which is opposed to, and includes landowners affected by, the project filed a request for rehearing and for a stay of the March 2006 Order. In August 2006, the FERC denied those requests. The Eastern Extension Project will add 31 miles of pipeline with 120 MDth/d (approximately 120 MMcf/d) of transportation capacity with total capital expenditures estimated to be $35 million, excluding AFUDC. The proposed in service date is the fourth quarter of 2007. Midwestern Gas Transmission is a bi directional system that interconnects with Tennessee Gas Transmission near Portland, Tennessee, and several interstate pipelines near Joliet, Illinois. In January 2007, ONEOK Partners subsidiary Crestone Powder River announced that Fort Union Gas Gathering will double its existing gathering pipeline capacity by adding 148 miles of new gathering lines resulting in 649 MMcf/d of additional capacity in the Powder River basin. The expansion will cost approximately $110 million and will occur in two phases with 240 MMcf/d in service by October 2007 and 409 MMcf/d by January 2008. The additional capacity has been fully subscribed for 10 years beginning with the in service date of the expansion. Crestone Powder River owns approximately 37 percent of Fort Union Gas Gathering. Stock Repurchase Plan A total of 15 million shares have been repurchased to date pursuant to a plan approved by our Board of Directors. The plan, originally approved by our Board of Directors in January 2005, was extended in November 2005, to allow us to purchase up to a total of 15 million shares of our common stock on or before November 2007. During 2005, we repurchased 7.5 million shares of our common stock pursuant to this plan. On August 7, 2006, we repurchased 7.5 million shares of our outstanding common stock under an accelerated share repurchase agreement with UBS Securities LLC (UBS) at an initial price of $37.52 per share for a total of $281.4 million, which completed the plan approved by our Board of Directors. Under the terms of the accelerated repurchase agreement, we repurchased 7.5 million shares immediately from UBS. UBS then borrowed 7.5 million of our shares and will purchase shares in the open market to settle its short position. Our repurchase is subject to a financial adjustment based on the volume weighted average price, less a discount, of the shares subsequently repurchased by UBS over the course of the repurchase period. The price adjustment can be settled, at our option, in cash or in shares of our common stock. In accordance with EITF Issue No. 99 7, Accounting for an Accelerated Share Repurchase Program, the repurchase was accounted for as two separate transactions: (1) as shares of common stock acquired in a treasury stock transaction recorded on the acquisition date and (2) as a forward contract indexed to ONEOK common stock. Additionally, we classified the forward contract as equity under EITF Issue No. 00 19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock. In February 2007, the forward purchase contract settled for a cash payment of $20.1 million, which was recorded in equity. We have no remaining shares authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase plan. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price volatility. Significant fluctuations in commodity price in either physical or financial energy contracts may impact our overall liquidity due to the impact the commodity price change has on items such as the cost of NGLs and gas held in storage, increased margin requirements, collectibility of certain energy related receivables and working capital. We believe that ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners current commercial paper program and lines of credit are adequate to meet our liquidity requirements associated with commodity price volatility. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans We calculate benefit obligations based upon generally accepted actuarial methodologies using the projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans. Pension costs and other postretirement obligations as of December 31 are determined using a September 30 measurement date. The benefit obligations are the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed to employee service rendered. The PBO is measured using the pension benefit formula and assumptions as to future compensation levels. A plans funded status is calculated as the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. Our funding policy for the pension plans is to make annual contributions in accordance with regulations under the Internal Revenue Code and in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles. Contributions made to our pension plan and postretirement benefit plan in 2006 were $1.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Additionally, we made benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plan of $11.4 million in 2006. For 2007, we anticipate our total 51 Table of Contents contributions to our pension plan and postretirement benefit plan to be $5.0 million and $13.4 million, respectively, and the expected benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plan are estimated to be $15.4 million. We believe we have adequate resources to fund our obligations under our plans. ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES We are subject to multiple environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid wastes and hazardous material and substance management. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines, penalties and or interruptions in our operations that could be material to the results of operations. If an accidental leak or spill of hazardous materials occurs from our lines or facilities, in the process of transporting natural gas or NGLs, or at any facility that we own, operate or otherwise use, we could be held jointly and severally liable for all resulting liabilities, including investigation and clean up costs, which could materially affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, emission controls required under the federal Clean Air Act and other similar federal and state laws could require unexpected capital expenditures at our facilities. We cannot assure our investors that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We own or retain legal responsibility for the environmental conditions at 12 former manufactured gas sites in Kansas that we acquired in November 1997. These sites contain potentially harmful materials that are subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. A consent agreement with the KDHE presently governs all work at these sites. The terms of the consent agreement allow us to investigate these sites and set remediation activities based upon the results of the investigations and risk analysis. Remediation typically involves the management of contaminated soils and may involve removal of structures and monitoring and or remediation of groundwater. We have commenced remediation on 11 sites, with regulatory closure achieved at two of these locations. Of the remaining nine sites, we have completed or are near completion of soil remediation at six sites, have commenced soil remediation at an additional site, and we expect to commence soil remediation on the other two sites in 2007. We have begun site assessment at the remaining site where no active remediation has occurred. To date, we have incurred remediation costs of $6.0 million and have accrued an additional $6.0 million related to the sites where we have commenced or will soon commence remediation. The $6.0 million estimate of future remediation costs for these sites is based on our environmental assessments and remediation plans approved to date by the KDHE. These estimates are recorded on an undiscounted basis. For the site that is currently in the assessment phase, we have completed some analysis, but are unable at this point to accurately estimate aggregate costs that may be required to satisfy our remedial obligations at this site. Until the site assessment is complete and the KDHE approves the remediation plan, we will not have complete information available to us to accurately estimate remediation costs. The costs associated with these sites do not include other potential expenses that might be incurred, such as unasserted property damage claims, personal injury or natural resource claims, unbudgeted legal expenses or other costs for which we may be held liable but with respect to which we cannot reasonably estimate an amount. As of this date, we have no knowledge of any of these types of claims. The foregoing expense estimates do not consider potential insurance recoveries, recoveries through rates or from unaffiliated parties, to which we may be entitled. We have filed claims with our insurance carriers relating to these sites and we have recovered a portion of our costs incurred to date. We have not recorded any amounts for potential insurance recoveries or recoveries from unaffiliated parties, and we are not recovering any environmental amounts in rates. As more information related to the site investigations and remediation activities becomes available, and to the extent such amounts are expected to exceed our current estimates, additional expenses could be recorded. Such amounts could be material to our results of operations and cash flows depending on the remediation and number of years over which the remediation is required to be completed. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows combines cash flows from discontinued operations with cash flows from continuing operations within each category. Discontinued operations accounted for approximately $77.2 million and $16.9 million in operating cash inflows for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Discontinued operations accounted for approximately $44.4 million and $52.9 million in investing cash outflows for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and did not account for any financing cash flows. The absence of cash flows from our discontinued operations is not expected to have a significant impact on our future cash flows. 52 Table of Contents Operating Cash Flows Operating cash flows increased by $1.04 billion for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily as a result of changes in components of working capital which increased operating cash flows by $56.9 million compared with a decrease of $585.7 million for the same period last year as a result of decreased accounts receivable, decreased inventories and decreased accounts payable. The impact of lower commodity prices on accounts receivable, accounts payable and natural gas inventory positively impacted operating cash flows in 2006 compared with 2005. The increase in 2006 operating cash flows was also impacted by the consolidation of ONEOK Partners as of January 1, 2006, due to EITF 04 5. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we received $123.4 million in distributions, primarily from Northern Border Pipeline, compared with distributions primarily from ONEOK Partners of $11.0 million in the prior year. Operating cash flows decreased by $404.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the same period in 2004. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily the result of changes in components of working capital. This decrease primarily related to increased accounts receivable and natural gas inventory, partially offset by increased accounts payable. The impact of higher commodity prices on accounts receivable, accounts payable and natural gas inventory negatively impacted operating cash flows for 2005 compared with 2004. There is typically a lag between when payment is made for natural gas purchased for our distribution customers and when the customers are billed. This is due to the cycle billing process where distribution customers are billed throughout the month. Under level prices, this lag would have no impact on cash flows from year to year, but with lower prices as experienced in 2006, this lag resulted in a positive impact on cash flows. Conversely, with increased prices as experienced in 2005, this lag resulted in a negative impact on cash flows. Our Energy Services segments deposits, or margin requirements, increase or decrease from year to year based on the level of open positions on our contracts, as well as commodity prices and price volatility. With the increase in commodity prices at December 31, 2005, we were required to meet additional margin requirements, which also negatively impacted operating cash flows for 2005. Margin requirements declined in 2006 resulting in increased cash flow. Investing Cash Flows Our ONEOK Partners segment received $297.0 million for the sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline in April 2006. Our Energy Services segment received $53.0 million for the sale of our discontinued component, Spring Creek. Acquisitions in 2006 primarily relate to our ONEOK Partners segment acquiring the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline not previously owned by ONEOK Partners for approximately $77 million. This purchase increased ONEOK Partners ownership interest to 100 percent. We also purchased from TransCanada its 17.5 percent general partner interest in ONEOK Partners for $40 million. This purchase resulted in our ownership of the entire 2 percent general partner interest in ONEOK Partners. Additionally, ONEOK Partners paid $11.6 million to Williams for a 99 percent interest in, and initial capital expenditures related to, the Overland Pass Pipeline Company. Acquisitions in 2005 primarily represent the purchase of the Koch assets. The sale of our former production segment resulted in proceeds from the sale of a discontinued component. The proceeds from the sale of assets in 2005 primarily resulted from the sale of our natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas. Additionally, the sale of Cimarex Energy Company common stock, formerly Magnum Hunter Resources (MHR) common stock, is also included in proceeds from sale of assets. This common stock was acquired upon exercise of MHR stock purchase warrants in February 2005, resulting in our paying $22.7 million, which is included in changes in other investments, net. Acquisitions in 2004 represent the cash purchase of Northern Plains, now known as ONEOK Partners GP. Increased capital expenditures in 2004 were primarily incurred by our discontinued former production segment. Proceeds from the sale of assets include the sales of certain natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines, compression assets, natural gas distribution systems and investments in 2004. Financing Cash Flows During 2006, we paid $165.3 million in distributions to minority interests, which primarily resulted from our consolidation of ONEOK Partners in accordance with EITF 04 5 as of January 1, 2006, and represents distributions to the unitholders of the 54.3 percent of ONEOK Partners that we do not own. We also paid $281.4 million to repurchase 7.5 million shares of our common stock in August 2006 pursuant to the plan approved by our Board of Directors. In 2006, we repaid the remaining $900 million outstanding on our $1.0 billion short term bridge financing agreement. During the second quarter of 2006, ONEOK Partners borrowed $1.05 billion under the ONEOK Partners Bridge Facility to 53 Table of Contents finance a portion of the acquisition of the ONEOK Energy Assets and $77 million under the 2006 Partnership Credit Agreement to acquire the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline not previously owned by ONEOK Partners. During the third quarter of 2006, ONEOK Partners completed the underwritten public offering of senior notes totaling $1.39 billion in net proceeds, before offering expenses, which were used to repay all of the amounts outstanding of the $1.05 billion borrowed under ONEOK Partners Bridge Facility and to repay $335 million of indebtedness outstanding under the 2006 Partnership Credit Agreement. In March 2006, ONEOK Partners borrowed $33 million under the 2006 Partnership Credit Agreement to redeem all of the outstanding Viking Gas Transmission Series A, B, C and D senior notes and paid a premium of $3.6 million. On February 16, 2006, we successfully settled our 16.1 million equity units with 19.5 million shares of our common stock. With the settlement, we received $402.4 million in cash, which was used to pay down our short term bridge financing agreement. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation on page 48 for additional discussion regarding the equity unit conversion. During 2005, we borrowed $1.0 billion under our short term bridge financing agreement to assist in financing the acquisition of natural gas liquids assets from Koch. We funded the remaining acquisition cost through our commercial paper program. We reduced our indebtedness under our short term bridge financing agreement by $100.0 million as a result of a required prepayment due to the sale of our former production segment. During 2005, we paid $233.0 million to repurchase 7.5 million shares of our stock pursuant to the plan approved by our Board of Directors. In December 2005, we made an early redemption of our 7.75 percent $300.0 million long term notes with a stated maturity of August 2006. In addition to the principal payment, we were required to pay a make whole call premium of $5.7 million and accrued interest of $8.7 million for a total payment of $314.4 million. We funded this early redemption with the proceeds from the sale of our natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas. In June 2005, we issued $800 million of long term notes and used a portion of the proceeds to repay commercial paper. The commercial paper had been issued to finance the Northern Border Partners acquisition, to repay $335 million of long term debt that matured on March 1, 2005, and to meet operating needs. This increase was partially offset by $643 million in payments on notes payable and commercial paper, which represents the cash received from the sale of our former production segment, and payments made in the normal course of operations. During the first quarter of 2005, we terminated $400 million of our interest rate swap agreements and paid a net amount of $19.4 million, which included $20.2 million for the present value of future payments at the time of termination, less $0.8 million for interest rate savings through the termination of the swaps. The $20.2 million payment has been recorded as a reduction in long term debt and will be recognized in the income statement over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged. In the second quarter of 2005, we terminated $500 million of our treasury rate lock agreements, which resulted in our paying $2.4 million. This amount, net of tax, has been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be recognized in the income statement over the term of the related debt issuances. During the first quarter of 2004, we repaid $600 million in notes payable using cash generated from operating activities and proceeds from our February 2004 equity offering. During the second half of 2004, we issued $644 million of notes payable, which includes the acquisition of Northern Plains, now known as ONEOK Partners GP, and funds used in the ordinary course of business. Also in the first quarter of 2004, we terminated $670 million of our interest rate swap agreements to lock in savings and generate a positive cash flow of $91.8 million, which included $8.9 million of interest savings previously recognized. These interest rate swaps were previously initiated as a strategy to hedge the fair value of fixed rate long term debt. The proceeds received upon termination of the interest rate swaps, net of amounts previously recognized, will be recognized in the income statement over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged. During the first quarter of 2004, we sold 6.9 million shares of our common stock to an underwriter at $21.93 per share, resulting in proceeds to us, before expenses, of $151.3 million. 54 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table sets forth our contractual obligations related to debt, operating leases and other long term obligations as of December 31, 2006, and reflects the consolidation of ONEOK Partners based on EITF 04 5.

Other than as required under securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or change in circumstances, expectations or otherwise. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Policy and Oversight We control the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibilities for our risk management limits and policies. Our risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price and credit risk management, and marketing and trading activities. The committee also monitors risk metrics including value at risk (VAR) and mark to market losses. We have a corporate risk control organization led by our vice president of audit, business development and risk control, who is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies and procedures and monitoring certain risk metrics. Key risk control activities include credit review and approval, credit and performance risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics. COMMODITY PRICE RISK Our exposure to market risk discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity prices. Our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in interest rates or commodity prices and the timing of transactions. We are exposed to market risk and the impact of market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil prices. Market risk refers to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in commodity energy prices. To minimize the risk from market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, we use commodity derivative instruments such as futures contracts, swaps and options to manage market risk of existing or anticipated purchase and sale agreements, existing physical natural gas in storage, and basis risk. We adhere to policies and procedures that limit our exposure to market risk from open positions and that monitor our market risk exposure. 57 Table of Contents ONEOK Partners ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk as its interstate and intrastate pipelines collect natural gas from its customers for operations or as part of their fee for services provided. When the amount of natural gas utilized in operations by these pipelines differs from the amount provided by their customers, the pipelines must buy or sell natural gas, or use natural gas from inventory, and are exposed to commodity price risk. At December 31, 2006, there were no hedges in place with respect to natural gas price risk from its interstate and intrastate pipeline operations. Also, ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk primarily as a result of NGLs in storage, spread risk associated with the relative values of the various components of the NGL stream and the relative value of NGL purchases at one location and sales at another location, known as basis risk. ONEOK Partners has not entered into any hedges with respect to its NGL marketing activities. Lastly, ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk primarily as a result of revenue realized from the sale of commodities received in exchange for its gathering and processing services. ONEOK Partners primary exposure arises from the relative price differential between natural gas and NGLs with respect to its keep whole processing contracts and the sale of natural gas, NGLs and condensate with respect to its POP contracts. To a lesser extent, ONEOK Partners is exposed to the risk of price fluctuations and the cost of intervening transportation at various market locations. ONEOK Partners uses commodity derivative contracts and fixed price physical contracts, including NYMEX based futures, collars and over the counter swaps, which are all designated as cash flow hedges, to minimize earnings volatility related to natural gas, NGL and condensate price fluctuations. The following table sets forth ONEOK Partners hedging information for 2007. Year Ending December 31, 2007 Product Volumes Hedged Average Price Per Unit Percent Percent of proceeds Natural gas liquids (Bbl/d) (a) 2,320 $ 40.23 33 % Keep whole Gross processing spread (MMBtu/d) (a) 6,410 $ 3.06 31 % (a) Hedged with fixed price swaps ONEOK Partners commodity price market risk is estimated as a hypothetical change in the price of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil at December 31, 2006. ONEOK Partners condensate sales are based on the price of crude oil. ONEOK Partners estimates that a $1.00 per barrel increase in the price of crude oil would increase annual net margin by approximately $0.4 million, excluding the effects of hedging. ONEOK Partners estimates that a $0.01 per gallon increase in the composite price of NGLs would increase annual net margin by approximately $2.1 million, excluding the effects of hedging. ONEOK Partners estimates that a $0.10 per MMBtu increase in the price of natural gas would decrease annual net margin by approximately $0.1 million, excluding the effects of hedging. The above estimates of commodity price risk do not include any effects on demand for its services that might be caused by, or arise in conjunction with, price changes. For example, increased commodity prices may reduce demand for ONEOK Partners storage and transportation services or may be caused by factors, such as weather, that increase demand for such services. Distribution Kansas Gas Service and certain jurisdictions of Texas Gas Service use derivative instruments to hedge the cost of anticipated natural gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect their customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural gas. At December 31, 2006, Kansas Gas Service had derivative instruments in place to hedge the cost of natural gas purchases for 2.0 Bcf, which represents part of their gas purchase requirements for the 2006/2007 winter heating months. Gains or losses associated with the Kansas Gas Service hedges are included in and recoverable through the monthly PGA. At December 31, 2006, Texas Gas Service had derivative instruments in place to hedge the cost of natural gas purchases for 0.6 Bcf, which represents part of their gas purchase requirements for the 2006/2007 winter heating months. Energy Services Our Energy Services segment is exposed to commodity price risk, including basis risk, arising from natural gas in storage and index based purchases and sales of natural gas at various market locations. We minimize the volatility of our exposure to commodity price risk through the use of derivative instruments, which, under certain circumstances, are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. We are also exposed to commodity price risk from fixed price purchases and sales of natural gas, 58 Table of Contents which we hedge with derivative instruments. Both the fixed price purchases and sales and related derivatives are recorded at fair value. Fair Value Component of the Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities The following table sets forth the fair value component of the energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities, excluding derivative instruments that have been declared as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair Value Component of Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities (Thousands of dollars) Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2005 $ 30,336 Derivatives realized or otherwise settled during the period (48,428 ) Fair value of new derivatives when entered into during the period (9,164 ) Other changes in fair value 14,123 Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2006 $ (13,133 ) The net fair value of derivatives outstanding includes the effect of settled energy contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of market movements on the fair value of energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities. Fair value estimates consider the market in which the transactions are executed. The market in which exchange traded and over the counter transactions are executed is a factor in determining fair value. We utilize third party references for pricing points from NYMEX and third party over the counter brokers to establish the commodity pricing and volatility curves. We believe the reported transactions from these sources are the most reflective of current market prices. Fair values are subject to change based on valuation factors. The estimate of fair value includes an adjustment for the liquidation of the position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions. The fair value estimate also considers the risk of nonperformance based on credit considerations of the counterparty. Maturity of Energy Trading Contracts The following table provides a detail of our Energy Services segments maturity of derivatives based on injection and withdrawal periods from April through March. This maturity schedule is consistent with our business strategy. Executory storage and transportation contracts and their related hedges are not included in the following table.

These fair values are reflected as a component of assets and liabilities from energy marketing and risk management activities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (b) Values are derived from the energy market price quotes from national commodity trading exchanges that primarily trade futures and option commodity contracts. (c) Values are obtained through energy commodity brokers or electronic trading platforms, whose primary service is to match willing buyers and sellers of energy commodities. Energy price information by location is readily available because of the large energy broker network. (d) Values derived in this category utilize market price information from the other two categories, as well as other assumptions for liquidity and credit. 59 Table of Contents For further discussion of trading activities and assumptions used in our trading activities, see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Also, see Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. Value at Risk (VAR) Disclosure of Market Risk We measure market risk in the energy marketing and risk management, trading and non trading portfolios of our Energy Services segment using a VAR methodology, which estimates the expected maximum loss of the portfolio over a specified time horizon within a given confidence interval. Our VAR calculations are based on the Monte Carlo approach. The quantification of market risk using VAR provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance, to determine risk targets and set position limits. The use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions, including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation. Inputs to the calculation include prices, volatilities, positions, instrument valuations and the variance covariance matrix. Historical data is used to estimate our VAR with more weight given to recent data, which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements. We rely on VAR to determine the potential reduction in the portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period. While management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable, no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating VAR. Different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different VAR estimates. Our VAR exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized for our non regulated businesses energy marketing and risk management, non trading and trading portfolios of derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and natural gas in storage due to adverse market movements. A one day time horizon and a 95 percent confidence level were used in our VAR data. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the VAR calculation based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices, operating exposures and timing thereof, and the changes in our derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and natural gas in storage. VAR information should be evaluated in light of these assumptions and the methodologys other limitations. The potential impact on our future earnings, as measured by the VAR, was $14.9 million and $29.5 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The following table details the average, high and low VAR calculations for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Average $ 18.5 $ 19.0 High $ 65.0 $ 54.1 Low $ 3.5 $ 7.5 Our VAR calculation includes derivatives, executory storage and transportation agreements and their related hedges. The variations in the VAR data are reflective of market volatility and changes in the portfolios during the year. The increase in VAR for 2006, compared with 2005, was due to higher average commodity prices beginning in the latter part of the third quarter 2005 and was prevalent into the second quarter 2006. In particular, there was significant price volatility in the latter part of the third quarter of 2005 due to weather related events. To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably. As a result, we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position. INTEREST RATE RISK General We are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the normal course of business. We manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates. At December 31, 2006, the interest rate on 82.9 percent of our long term debt, exclusive of the debt of our ONEOK Partners segment, was fixed after considering the impact of interest rate swaps, while the interest rate on 92.6 percent of ONEOK Partners long term debt was fixed after considering the impact of interest rate swaps. 60 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, a 100 basis point move in the annual interest rate on all of our outstanding long term debt would change our annual interest expense by $5.0 million before taxes. This 100 basis point change assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. If interest rates changed significantly, we would take actions to manage our exposure to the change. Since a specific action and the possible effects are uncertain, no change has been assumed. Fair Value Hedges In prior years, we and ONEOK Partners terminated various interest rate swap agreements. The net savings from the termination of these swaps is being recognized in interest expense over the terms of the debt instruments originally hedged. Net interest expense savings for 2006 for all terminated swaps was $10.1 million, and the remaining net savings for all terminated swaps will be recognized over the following periods: ONEOK ONEOKPartners Total (Millions of dollars) 2007 $ 6.6 $ 3.4 $ 10.0 2008 6.6 3.6 10.2 2009 5.6 3.8 9.4 2010 5.5 4.0 9.5 2011 2.5 0.8 3.3 Thereafter 12.8 12.8 Currently, $490 million of fixed rate debt is swapped to floating. The floating rate debt is based on both the three and six month LIBOR, depending upon the swap. Based on the actual performance through December 31, 2006, the weighted average interest rate on the $490 million of debt increased from 6.64 percent to 7.18 percent. At December 31, 2006, we recorded a net liability of $13.5 million to recognize the interest rate swaps at fair value. Long term debt was decreased by $13.5 million to recognize the change in the fair value of the related hedged liability. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Total savings for both terminated and active swaps for 2006 were $7.6 million, compared with the savings of $10.7 million in 2005. Total swap savings for 2007 is expected to be $8.1 million. Prior to the issuance of the $800 million of notes in the second quarter of 2005, we entered into $500 million in treasury rate lock agreements to hedge the changes in cash flows of our anticipated interest payments from changes in treasury rates prior to the issuance of the notes. Upon the issuance of the notes in June 2005, we paid $2.4 million related to the termination of the treasury rate lock agreements. This amount, net of tax, has been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be recognized in the income statement over the term of the related debt issuances. CURRENCY RATE RISK With our Energy Services segments expansion into Canada, we are subject to currency exposure related to our firm transportation and storage contracts. Our objective with respect to currency risk is to reduce the exposure due to exchange rate fluctuations. We use physical forward transactions, which result in an actual two way flow of currency on the settlement date since we exchange U.S. dollars for Canadian dollars with another party. We have not designated these transactions for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, the gains and losses associated with the change in fair value are recorded in net margin. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, our exposure to risk from currency translation was not material and there was no material currency translation gain or loss recorded. 61 Table of Contents
