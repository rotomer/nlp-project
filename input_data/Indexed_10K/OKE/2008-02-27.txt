ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The following discussion highlights some of our achievements and significant issues affecting us this past year. Please refer to the Financial and Operating Results section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete explanation of the following items. Diluted earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations (EPS) increased to $2.79 in 2007, compared with $2.68 in 2006. The increase in operating income for 2007, compared with 2006, and exclusive of the gain on sale of assets, is primarily due to the implementation of new rate schedules in Kansas and Texas in our Distribution segment and new supply connections and higher product price spreads in our ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids businesses. This increase was partially offset by reduced operating income in our Energy Services segment primarily due to decreased transportation margins during 2007. In September 2007, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public debt offering of $600 million to finance the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan and to repay outstanding debt under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, which was incurred to fund ONEOK Partners internal growth capital projects. The assets acquired from Kinder Morgan and ONEOK Partners capital projects are discussed below in the Significant Acquisitions and Divestitures and the Capital Projects sections, respectively. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share ($1.52 per share on an annualized basis) in January 2008, an increase of approximately 12 percent over the $0.34 declared in January 2007. ONEOK Partners declared an increase in its cash distribution to $1.025 per unit ($4.10 per unit on an annualized basis) in January 2008, an increase of approximately 5 percent over the $0.98 declared in January 2007. SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES In October 2007, ONEOK Partners completed the acquisition of an interstate natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products pipeline system and related assets from a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan for approximately $300 million, before working capital adjustments. The system extends from Bushton and Conway, Kansas, to Chicago, Illinois, and transports, stores and delivers a full range of NGL and refined petroleum products. The FERC regulated system spans 1,627 miles and has a capacity to transport up to 134 MBbl/d. The transaction includes approximately 978 MBbl of owned storage capacity, eight NGL terminals and a 50 percent ownership of Heartland. ConocoPhillips owns the other 50 percent of Heartland and is the managing partner of the Heartland joint venture, which consists primarily of three refined petroleum products terminals 29 Table of Contents and connecting pipelines. Financing for this transaction came from the proceeds of ONEOK Partners September 2007 issuance of $600 million 6.85 percent Senior Notes due 2037 (the 2037 Notes). See Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a discussion on the 2037 Notes. In April 2006, we sold certain assets comprising our former gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage segments to ONEOK Partners for approximately $3 billion, including $1.35 billion in cash, before adjustments, and approximately 36.5 million Class B limited partner units in ONEOK Partners. The Class B limited partner units and the related general partner interest contribution were valued at approximately $1.65 billion. We also purchased, through ONEOK Partners GP, from an affiliate of TransCanada, 17.5 percent of the general partner interest in ONEOK Partners for $40 million. This purchase resulted in our owning the entire 2 percent general partner interest in ONEOK Partners. Following the completion of the transactions, we own a total of approximately 37.0 million common and Class B limited partner units and the entire 2 percent general partner interest and control of the partnership. Our overall interest in ONEOK Partners, including the 2 percent general partner interest, is 45.7 percent. The sale of certain assets comprising our former gathering and processing, pipelines and storage, and natural gas liquids segments did not affect our consolidated operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income or total assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we were already required under EITF 04 5 to consolidate our investment in ONEOK Partners effective January 1, 2006. However, minority interest expense and net income are affected. See Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K beginning on page 68 for additional discussion of EITF 04 5. In connection with the transactions described immediately above, our ONEOK Partners segment completed the sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline to TC PipeLines for approximately $297 million. Our ONEOK Partners segment recorded a gain on sale of approximately $113.9 million in the second quarter of 2006. ONEOK Partners and TC PipeLines each now own a 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline, and an affiliate of TransCanada became operator of the pipeline in April 2007. As a result of this transaction, ONEOK Partners interest in Northern Border Pipeline is accounted for as an investment under the equity method applied on a retroactive basis to January 1, 2006. Also in April 2006, our ONEOK Partners segment acquired the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline not previously owned by ONEOK Partners for approximately $77 million, increasing its ownership interest to 100 percent. ONEOK Partners used borrowings from its credit facility to fund the acquisition of the additional interest in Guardian Pipeline. Following the completion of the transaction, we consolidated Guardian Pipeline in our consolidated financial statements. This change was accounted for on a retroactive basis to January 1, 2006. In December 2005, we sold our natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas to a subsidiary of Eagle Rock Energy, Inc. for approximately $527.2 million and recorded a pre tax gain of $264.2 million, which is included in gain on sale of assets in our ONEOK Partners segments operating income. The gain reflects the cash received less adjustments, selling expenses and the net book value of the assets sold. We used the net cash proceeds from this sale to prepay our 7.75 percent $300 million long term debt that was due in August 2006. In October 2005, we entered into an agreement to sell our Spring Creek power plant, located in Oklahoma, to Westar for $53 million. The transaction received FERC approval and the sale was completed on October 31, 2006. The 300 megawatt gas fired merchant power plant was built in 2001 to supply electrical power during peak periods using gas powered turbine generators. The financial information related to the properties sold is reflected as a discontinued component in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All periods presented have been restated to reflect the discontinued component. See Discontinued Operations on page 46 for additional information. In September 2005, we completed the sale of our former production segment to TXOK Acquisition, Inc. for $645 million, before adjustments and recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately $240.3 million. The gain reflects the cash received less adjustments, selling expenses and the net book value of the assets sold. The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce debt. The financial information related to the properties sold is reflected as a discontinued component in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All periods presented have been restated to reflect the discontinued component. In July 2005, we completed the acquisition of the natural gas liquids businesses owned by Koch for approximately $1.33 billion, net of working capital and cash received. This transaction included Koch Hydrocarbon, LPs entire Mid Continent natural gas liquids fractionation business; Koch Pipeline Company, LPs natural gas liquids pipeline distribution systems; Chisholm Pipeline Holdings, Inc., now Chisholm Pipeline Holdings, L.L.C., which has a 50 percent ownership interest in Chisholm Pipeline Company; MBFF, LP, now ONEOK MBI, L.P., which owns an 80 percent interest in a 160 MBbl/d fractionator at Mont Belvieu, Texas; and Koch Vesco Holdings, LLC, now ONEOK Vesco Holdings, L.L.C., an entity that 30 Table of Contents owns a 10.2 percent interest in Venice Energy Services Company, L.LC. These assets are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on July 1, 2005, and were part of the assets ONEOK Partners acquired from us in April 2006. CAPITAL PROJECTS All of the capital projects discussed below are in our ONEOK Partners segment. Woodford Shale Natural Gas Liquids Pipeline Extension In February 2008, ONEOK Partners announced plans to construct a 78 mile natural gas liquids gathering pipeline to connect two natural gas processing plants in the Woodford Shale area in southeast Oklahoma at a cost of approximately $25 million, excluding AFUDC. The project is currently scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 2008. These two plants are expected to produce approximately 25 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs. Until the Arbuckle Pipeline project is completed, the natural gas liquids production will be transported by ONEOK Partners existing Mid Continent natural gas liquids pipelines. Upon completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline project, the Woodford Shale natural gas liquids production is expected to be transported to ONEOK Partners Mont Belvieu, Texas, fractionation facility. Overland Pass Pipeline Company In May 2006, a subsidiary of ONEOK Partners entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Williams to form a joint venture called Overland Pass Pipeline Company. Overland Pass Pipeline Company is building a 760 mile natural gas liquids pipeline from Opal, Wyoming, to the Mid Continent natural gas liquids market center in Conway, Kansas. The pipeline is designed to transport approximately 110 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs, which can be increased to approximately 150 MBbl/d with additional pump facilities. During 2006, ONEOK Partners paid $11.6 million to Williams for the acquisition of its interest in the joint venture and for reimbursement of initial capital expenditures. A subsidiary of ONEOK Partners owns 99 percent of the joint venture and will manage the construction project, advance all costs associated with construction and operate the pipeline. Within two years of the pipeline becoming operational, Williams will have the option to increase its ownership up to 50 percent by reimbursing ONEOK Partners for its proportionate share of all construction costs. If Williams exercises its option to increase its ownership to the full 50 percent, Williams would have the option to become operator. This project has received the required approvals of various state and federal regulatory authorities, and ONEOK Partners is constructing the pipeline with start up currently scheduled for the second quarter of 2008. As part of a long term agreement, Williams dedicated its NGL production from two of its natural gas processing plants in Wyoming to the joint venture company. Subsidiaries of ONEOK Partners will provide downstream fractionation, storage and transportation services to Williams. The pipeline project is currently estimated to cost approximately $535 million, excluding AFUDC. Since ONEOK Partners initial estimate in early 2006, there has been a significant increase in the demand for pipeline construction related services, which has led to higher rates, particularly for construction labor and equipment. Additionally, due to the extended permitting process, ONEOK Partners is constructing the pipeline during the winter months, which could contribute to added construction costs and could cause further delays. The severity of the winter conditions could further impact ONEOK Partners cost and schedule estimates. In addition, ONEOK Partners is investing approximately $216 million, excluding AFUDC, to expand its existing fractionation and storage capabilities and the capacity of its natural gas liquids distribution pipelines. ONEOK Partners financing for the projects may include a combination of short or long term debt or equity. Piceance Lateral Pipeline In March 2007, ONEOK Partners announced that Overland Pass Pipeline Company also plans to construct a 150 mile lateral pipeline with capacity to transport as much as 100 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs from the Piceance Basin in Colorado to the Overland Pass Pipeline. Williams announced that it intends to construct a new natural gas processing plant in the Piceance Basin and will dedicate its NGL production from that plant and an existing plant to be transported by the lateral pipeline. This project requires the approval of various state and federal regulatory authorities. Assuming Overland Pass Pipeline Company obtains the required state and federal regulatory approvals, construction of this lateral pipeline is currently expected to begin in late 2008 and be completed during the second quarter of 2009, at a current cost estimate of approximately $120 million, excluding AFUDC. Arbuckle Pipeline Natural Gas Liquids Pipeline In March 2007, ONEOK Partners announced plans to build the 440 mile Arbuckle Pipeline, a natural gas liquids pipeline from southern Oklahoma through northern Texas and continuing on to the Texas Gulf Coast, at a current estimated cost of approximately $260 million, excluding AFUDC. The Arbuckle Pipeline will have the capacity to transport 160 MBbl/d of unfractionated natural gas liquids and will connect with ONEOK Partners existing Mid Continent infrastructure and its fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas, and other Gulf Coast region fractionators. Construction of the pipeline will require permits from various federal, state and local regulatory bodies. Construction is currently expected to begin in mid 2008 and be completed by early 2009. 31 Table of Contents Williston Basin Gas Processing Plant Expansion In March 2007, ONEOK Partners announced the expansion of its Grasslands natural gas processing facility in North Dakota at a cost of approximately $30 million, excluding AFUDC. The Grasslands facility is ONEOK Partners largest natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin. The expansion increases processing capacity to approximately 100 MMcf/d from its current capacity of 63 MMcf/d and increases fractionation capacity to approximately 12 MBbl/d from 8 MBbl/d. The expansion project is expected to come on line in phases, with the final phase currently expected to be on line in the third quarter of 2008. Fort Union Gas Gathering Expansion In January 2007, Fort Union Gas Gathering announced that it will double its existing gathering pipeline capacity by adding 148 miles of new gathering lines, resulting in approximately 649 MMcf/d of additional capacity in the Powder River basin of Wyoming. The expansion is expected to cost approximately $110 million, excluding AFUDC, which will be financed within the Fort Union Gas Gathering partnership and will occur in two phases. Phase 1, with more than 200 MMcf/d capacity, was placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2007. Phase 2, with approximately 450 MMcf/d capacity, is currently expected to be in service during the second quarter of 2008. The additional capacity has been fully subscribed for 10 years beginning with the in service date of the expansion. ONEOK Partners owns approximately 37 percent of Fort Union Gas Gathering, and accounts for its ownership under the equity method of accounting. Guardian Pipeline Expansion and Extension In December 2007, Guardian Pipeline received and accepted the certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the FERC for its expansion and extension project. The certificate authorizes ONEOK Partners to construct, install and operate approximately 119 miles of a 20 inch and 30 inch natural gas transportation pipeline with a capacity to transport 537 MMcf/d of natural gas north from Ixonia, Wisconsin to the Green Bay, Wisconsin, area. The project is supported by long term shipper commitments. The cost of the project is currently estimated to be $260 million, excluding AFUDC. The pipeline is currently expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2008. Midwestern Gas Transmission Eastern Extension Midwestern Gas Transmissions eastern extension pipeline was placed into service in January 2008. The extension added approximately 31 miles of natural gas transportation pipeline, with a capacity to transport 120 MMcf/d of natural gas from Midwesterns previous terminus at Portland, Tennessee, to interconnects with Columbia Gulf Transmission Company and East Tennessee Natural Gas, LLC, near Hartsville, Tennessee. The project is supported by a long term shipper commitment. Total capital expenditures are expected to be $62 million, excluding AFUDC. REGULATORY Several regulatory initiatives positively impacted the earnings and future earnings potential for our Distribution segment and our ONEOK Partners segment. See discussion of our Distribution segments regulatory initiative beginning on page 43. IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Information about the impact of Statement 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, Statement 157, Fair Value Measurements, Statement 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, FASB Staff Position No. FIN 39 1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39, EITF Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, Statement 123R, Share Based Payment, Statement 141R, Business Combinations and Statement 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment to ARB No. 51, are included in Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates. The following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies, which are defined as those policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring managements most difficult, subjective or 32 Table of Contents complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters. We have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Derivatives, Accounting for Financially Settled Transactions and Risk Management Activities We engage in wholesale energy marketing, retail marketing, trading and risk management activities. We account for derivative instruments utilized in connection with these activities and services under the fair value basis of accounting in accordance with Statement 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Under Statement 133, entities are required to record derivative instruments at fair value. The fair value of a derivative instrument is determined by commodity exchange prices, over the counter quotes, volatility, time value, counterparty credit and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions. Refer to the table on page 57 for amounts in our portfolio at December 31, 2007, that were determined by prices actively quoted, prices provided by other external sources and prices derived from other sources. The majority of our portfolios fair values are based on actual market prices. Transactions are also executed in markets for which market prices may exist but the market may be relatively inactive, thereby resulting in limited price transparency that requires managements subjectivity in estimating fair values. Market value changes result in a change in the fair value of our derivative instruments. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the nature of the risk being hedged and how we will determine if the hedging instrument is effective. If the derivative instrument does not qualify or is not designated as part of a hedging relationship, then we account for changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings as they occur. Commodity price volatility may have a significant impact on the gain or loss in any given period. For more information on fair value sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. To minimize the risk of fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and condensate prices, we periodically enter into futures, collars or swap transactions in order to hedge anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs, condensate, and fuel requirements. Interest rate swaps are also used to manage interest rate risk. Under certain conditions, we designate these derivative instruments as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values or cash flow. For hedges of exposure to changes in cash flow, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recorded to earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness of designated hedges is reported in earnings during the period the ineffectiveness occurs. For hedges of exposure to changes in fair value, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings during the period of change together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. Upon election, many of our purchase and sale agreements that otherwise would be required to follow derivative accounting qualify as normal purchases and normal sales under Statement 133 and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment. The presentation of settled derivative instruments on either a gross or net basis in our Consolidated Statements of Income is dependent on a number of factors, including whether the derivative instrument is (i) held for trading purposes, (ii) financially settled, (iii) results in physical delivery or services rendered, and (iv) qualifies for the normal purchase or sale exception as defined in Statement 133. In accordance with EITF 03 11, Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and not Held for Trading as Defined in EITF Issue No. 02 3, EITF 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and Statement 133, we report settled derivative instruments as follows: all financially settled derivative contracts are reported on a net basis, derivative instruments considered held for trading purposes that result in physical delivery are reported on a net basis, derivative instruments not considered held for trading purposes that result in physical delivery or services rendered are reported on a gross basis, and derivatives that qualify for the normal purchase or sale exception as defined in Statement 133 are reported on a gross basis. We apply the indicators in EITF 99 19 to determine the appropriate accounting treatment for non derivative contracts that result in physical delivery. See Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more discussion of derivatives and risk management activities. 33 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets We assess our long lived assets for impairment based on Statement 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. A long lived asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may exceed its fair value. Fair values are based on the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. We assess our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually based on Statement 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. There were no impairment charges resulting from the July 1, 2007, impairment tests and no events indicating an impairment have occurred subsequent to that date. An initial assessment is made by comparing the fair value of the operations with goodwill, as determined in accordance with Statement 142, to the book value of each reporting unit. If the fair value is less than the book value, an impairment is indicated, and we must perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment. In the second test, we calculate the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the operations with goodwill from the fair value determined in step one of the assessment. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds this calculated implied fair value of the goodwill, we will record an impairment charge. At December 31, 2007, we had $600.7 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as shown below. (Thousands of dollars) ONEOK Partners $ 431,418 Distribution 157,953 Energy Services 10,255 Other 1,099 Total goodwill $ 600,725 Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life, while intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized. All intangible assets are subject to impairment testing. Our ONEOK Partners segment had $443.0 million of intangible assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007, of which $287.5 million is being amortized over an aggregate weighted average period of 40 years, while the remaining balance has an indefinite life. During 2006, we recorded a goodwill and asset impairment related to ONEOK Partners Black Mesa Pipeline of $8.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively, which were recorded as depreciation and amortization. The reduction to our net income, net of minority interests and income taxes, was $3.0 million. In the third quarter of 2005, we made the decision to sell our Spring Creek power plant, located in Oklahoma, and exit the power generation business. In October 2005, we concluded that our Spring Creek power plant had been impaired and recorded an impairment expense of $52.2 million. This conclusion was based on our Statement 144 impairment analysis of the results of operations for this plant through September 30, 2005, and also the net sales proceeds from the anticipated sale of the plant. The sale was completed on October 31, 2006. This component of our business is accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with Statement 144. See Discontinued Operations on page 46 for additional information. Our total unamortized excess cost over underlying fair value of net assets accounted for under the equity method was $185.6 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. Based on Statement 142, this amount, referred to as equity method goodwill, should continue to be recognized in accordance with APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. Accordingly, we included this amount in investment in unconsolidated affiliates on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pension and Postretirement Employee Benefits We have defined benefit retirement plans covering certain full time employees. We sponsor welfare plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees who retire with at least five years of service. Our actuarial consultant calculates the expense and liability related to these plans and uses statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, age and employment periods. In determining the projected benefit obligations and costs, assumptions can change from period to period and result in material changes in the costs and liabilities we recognize. See Note J of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information. 34 Table of Contents Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for our health care plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects. One PercentagePoint Increase One PercentagePoint Decrease (Thousands of dollars) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 1,969 $ (1,665 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 20,685 $ (18,014 ) During 2007, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $29.1 million related to our defined benefit pension plans and $26.7 million related to postretirement benefits. We estimate that in 2008, we will record net periodic benefit costs of $19.8 million related to our defined benefit pension plan and $28.3 million related to postretirement benefits. In determining our estimated expenses for 2008, our actuarial consultant assumed an 8.75 percent expected return on plan assets and a discount rate of 6.25 percent. A decrease in our expected return on plan assets to 8.50 percent would increase our 2008 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $1.8 million for our defined benefit pension plan and would not have a significant impact on our postretirement benefit plan. A decrease in our assumed discount rate to 6.00 percent would increase our 2008 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $2.5 million for our defined benefit pension plan and $0.7 million for our postretirement benefit plan. For 2008, we anticipate our total contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and postretirement benefit plan to be $3.1 million and $11.0 million, respectively, and the expected benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plan are estimated to be $16.7 million. Contingencies Our accounting for contingencies covers a variety of business activities, including contingencies for legal and environmental exposures. We accrue these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with Statement 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We base our estimates on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution. Actual results may differ from our estimates resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on earnings. See Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional discussion of contingencies. FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS Consolidated Operations Selected Financial Information The following table sets forth certain selected financial information for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2007 2006 2005 (Thousands of dollars) Operating revenues, excluding energy trading revenues $ 13,488,027 $ 11,913,529 $ 12,663,550 Energy trading revenues, net (10,613 ) 6,797 12,680 Cost of sales and fuel 11,667,306 10,198,342 11,338,076 Net margin 1,810,108 1,721,984 1,338,154 Operating costs 761,510 740,767 619,995 Depreciation and amortization 227,964 235,543 183,394 Gain (loss) on sale of assets 1,909 116,528 269,040 Operating income $ 822,543 $ 862,202 $ 803,805 Equity earnings from investments $ 89,908 $ 95,883 $ 8,621 Allowance for equity funds used during construction $ 12,538 $ 2,205 $ Interest Expense $ 256,325 $ 239,725 $ 147,608 Minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries $ 193,199 $ 222,000 $ Operating Results Net margin increased for 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to the implementation of new rate schedules in Kansas and Texas in our Distribution segment. Net margin was also positively impacted during 2007 by our ONEOK Partners segment due to its natural gas liquids businesses, which benefited primarily from new supply connections that increased volumes gathered, transported, fractionated and sold. Net margin also increased due to ONEOK Partners 35 Table of Contents natural gas liquids gathering and fractionation business benefiting from higher product price spreads and higher isomerization price spreads as well as the incremental net margin related to the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan in October 2007. These increases were offset by decreased transportation margins in our Energy Services segment and decreased net margin in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business, primarily due to lower natural gas volumes processed as a result of contract terminations in late 2006. For an explanation of energy trading revenues, net, see the discussion of our Energy Services segment beginning on page 43. Consolidated operating costs increased for 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to higher employee related costs and the incremental operating expenses associated with ONEOK Partners acquisition of assets from Kinder Morgan in October 2007, coupled with increased bad debt expense and higher property taxes in our Distribution segment. These increases were partially offset by lower litigation costs in our ONEOK Partners segment and lower employee related costs in our Distribution segment. Depreciation and amortization decreased for 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to a goodwill and asset impairment charge of $12.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2006 related to Black Mesa Pipeline, which is included in our ONEOK Partners segment. Gain (loss) on sale of assets decreased for 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to the $113.9 million gain on sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline recorded in the second quarter of 2006 in our ONEOK Partners segment. Equity earnings from investments decreased for 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to the decrease in ONEOK Partners share of Northern Border Pipelines earnings from 70 percent in the first quarter of 2006 to 50 percent beginning in the second quarter of 2006. Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased for 2007, compared with 2006, due to ONEOK Partners capital projects, which are discussed beginning on page 31. Interest expense increased for 2007, primarily due to the additional borrowings by ONEOK Partners to complete the April 2006 transactions with us. The additional borrowings resulted in $21.3 million in higher interest expense in the first quarter of 2007 compared with the same period in 2006. Increased interest expense was partially offset by lower interest expense on short term debt of $11.8 million during 2007, compared with the same period in 2006, as a result of the proceeds from the sale of assets to ONEOK Partners, which reduced short term debt. Minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries for 2007 and 2006 reflects the remaining 54.3 percent of ONEOK Partners that we do not own. For 2007, minority interest was lower due to the $113.9 million gain on sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline recorded in the second quarter of 2006 in our ONEOK Partners segment. Additionally, minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiaries for our ONEOK Partners segment for 2006 included the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline that ONEOK Partners did not own until April 2006. ONEOK Partners owned 100 percent of Guardian Pipeline beginning in April 2006, resulting in no minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries related to Guardian Pipeline after March 31, 2006. Net margin increased for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to: the consolidation of our investment in ONEOK Partners as required by EITF 04 5, the effect of the natural gas liquids assets acquired from Koch in our ONEOK Partners segment, strong commodity prices, higher gross processing spreads and increased natural gas transportation revenue in our ONEOK Partners segment, and improved natural gas basis differentials on transportation contracts, net of hedging activities, in our Energy Services segment. Consolidated operating costs for 2006 increased, compared with 2005, primarily because of consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations and the natural gas liquids assets acquired in 2005, offset by the sale of the Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets in December 2005. Depreciation and amortization increased for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations, the Black Mesa Pipeline impairment, and the costs associated with the natural gas liquids assets acquired from Koch. 36 Table of Contents Operating income for 2006 includes the gain on sale of assets of $113.9 million related to ONEOK Partners sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline to TC PipeLines in April 2006. Operating income for 2005 includes the gain on sale of assets in our ONEOK Partners segment of $264.2 million. This gain was the result of the sale of certain natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas to a subsidiary of Eagle Rock Energy, Inc. in December 2005. For additional information, see discussion on page 30. Equity earnings from investments increased $87.3 million in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily as a result of our adoption of EITF 04 5 as of January 1, 2006, which resulted in our consolidation of ONEOK Partners. ONEOK Partners holds various investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including a 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline. Prior to January 1, 2006, ONEOK Partners was accounted for as an investment under the equity method. Minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries, which reflects the remaining 54.3 percent of ONEOK Partners that we do not own, increased $222.0 million in 2006, compared with 2005, as a result of our 2006 adoption of EITF 04 5. Additional information regarding our results of operations is provided in the discussion of each segments results. The discontinued component is discussed in our Discontinued Operations and Energy Services segment sections. Key Performance Indicators Key performance indicators reviewed by management include: earnings per share, return on invested capital, and shareholder appreciation. For 2007, our basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.84 and $2.79, respectively, representing a 4 percent increase in basic earnings per share and a 4 percent increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared with 2006. For 2006, our basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.74 and $2.68, respectively, representing a 32 percent decrease in basic earnings per share and a 28 percent decrease in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared with 2005. Return on invested capital was 14 percent in 2007 and 2006 compared with 23 percent in 2005. Our 2006 results include the impact from the gain on the sale of a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline. The significantly higher earnings per share results in 2005 are primarily related to the gain on the sale of our Texas gathering and processing assets; this gain on sale, coupled with the gain on the sale of our production assets, increased our return on invested capital in 2005. To evaluate shareholder appreciation, we compare the total return of an investment in our stock with the total return of an investment in the stock of our peer companies. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we ranked third in this shareholder appreciation calculation when compared with our peers. ONEOK Partners Overview Effective January 1, 2006, we were required to consolidate ONEOK Partners operations in our consolidated financial statements under EITF 04 5, and we elected to use the prospective method. In April 2006, we sold certain assets comprising our former gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage segments to ONEOK Partners for approximately $3 billion, including $1.35 billion in cash before adjustments, and approximately 36.5 million Class B limited partner units in ONEOK Partners. These former segments are included in our ONEOK Partners segment for all periods presented. We own 45.7 percent of ONEOK Partners; the remaining interest in ONEOK Partners is reflected as minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries on our Consolidated Statements of Income. ONEOK Partners gathers and processes natural gas and fractionates NGLs primarily in the Mid Continent and Rocky Mountain regions. ONEOK Partners operations include the gathering of natural gas production from oil and natural gas wells. Through gathering systems, these volumes are aggregated and treated or processed to remove water vapor, solids and other contaminants, and to extract NGLs in order to provide marketable natural gas, commonly referred to as residue gas. When the liquids are separated from the raw natural gas at the processing plants, the liquids are generally in the form of a mixed, unfractionated NGL stream. ONEOK Partners also gathers, treats, fractionates, transports and stores NGLs. ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids gathering pipelines deliver unfractionated NGLs gathered from natural gas processing plants located in Oklahoma, Kansas and the Texas panhandle to fractionators it owns in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. ONEOK Partners NGL distribution assets connect the key NGL market centers in Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, as well as the Midwest markets near Chicago, Illinois. 37 Table of Contents ONEOK Partners operates interstate and intrastate natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas storage facilities and non processable natural gas gathering facilities. ONEOK Partners interstate assets transport natural gas through FERC regulated interstate natural gas pipelines. ONEOK Partners intrastate natural gas pipeline assets access the major natural gas producing areas and transport natural gas throughout Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. ONEOK Partners owns or reserves storage capacity in underground natural gas storage facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. Acquisition and Divestitures The following acquisition and divestitures are described beginning on page 75. In October 2007, ONEOK Partners completed the acquisition of an interstate natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products pipeline system and related assets from a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan for approximately $300 million, before working capital adjustments. The system extends from Bushton and Conway, Kansas, to Chicago, Illinois, and transports, stores and delivers a full range of NGL and refined petroleum products. The FERC regulated system spans 1,627 miles and has a capacity to transport up to 134 MBbl/d. The transaction includes approximately 978 MBbl of owned storage capacity, eight NGL terminals and a 50 percent ownership of Heartland. In April 2006, ONEOK Partners completed the sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline to TC PipeLines. ONEOK Partners and TC PipeLines each now own a 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline, and an affiliate of TransCanada became operator of the pipeline in April 2007. In April 2006, we sold certain assets comprising our former gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage segments to ONEOK Partners for approximately $3 billion, including $1.35 billion in cash, before adjustments, and approximately 36.5 million Class B limited partner units in ONEOK Partners. The Class B limited partner units and the related general partner interest contribution were valued at approximately $1.65 billion. We also purchased, through ONEOK Partners GP, from an affiliate of TransCanada, 17.5 percent of the general partner interest in ONEOK Partners for $40 million. This purchase resulted in our owning the entire 2 percent general partner interest in ONEOK Partners. In April 2006, our ONEOK Partners segment acquired the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline not previously owned by ONEOK Partners for approximately $77 million, increasing its ownership interest to 100 percent. In December 2005, we sold our natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas. This sale included approximately 3,700 miles of pipe and six processing plants with a capacity of 0.2 Bcf/d. The impact of these assets on our ONEOK Partners segments operating income for the year ended December 31, 2005, was a decrease of $42.0 million. Additionally, we sold approximately 10 miles of non contiguous, natural gas gathering pipelines in Texas. In July 2005, we acquired natural gas liquids businesses from Koch. We also acquired Koch Vesco Holdings, LLC, an entity, which owns a 10.2 percent interest in Venice Energy Services Company, L.L.C. Venice Energy Services Company, L.L.C. owns a gas processing complex near Venice, Louisiana. Selected Financial and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for our ONEOK Partners segment for the periods indicated.

(b) Statistics relate to our natural gas gathering and processing business. Operating results We began consolidating our investment in ONEOK Partners as of January 1, 2006, in accordance with EITF 04 5. We elected to use the prospective method, which results in our consolidated financial results and operating information including data for the legacy ONEOK Partners operations beginning January 1, 2006. For additional information, see Significant Accounting Policies in Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Net margin increased by $52.3 million in 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to the following: increased performance of ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids businesses, which benefited primarily from new supply connections that increased volumes gathered, transported, fractionated and sold, higher NGL product price spreads and higher isomerization price spreads in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids gathering and fractionation business, the incremental net margin related to the acquisition of assets from Kinder Morgan in October 2007 in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids pipelines business, and increased storage margins in ONEOK Partners natural gas pipelines business, that was partially offset by decreased natural gas processing and transportation margins in ONEOK Partners natural gas businesses resulting primarily from lower throughput, higher fuel costs and lower natural gas volumes processed as a result of various contract terminations. Operating costs increased by $11.6 million during 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to higher employee related costs and the incremental operating expenses associated with the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan, partially offset by lower litigation costs. Depreciation and amortization decreased by $8.3 million during 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to a goodwill and asset impairment charge of $12.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2006 related to Black Mesa Pipeline. Gain on sale of assets decreased by $113.5 million during 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to the $113.9 million gain on the sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline recorded in the second quarter of 2006. Equity earnings from investments for 2007 and 2006 primarily include earnings from ONEOK Partners interest in Northern Border Pipeline. The decrease of $6.0 million during 2007, compared with 2006, is primarily due to the decrease in ONEOK Partners share of Northern Border Pipelines earnings from 70 percent in the first quarter of 2006 to 50 percent beginning in the second quarter of 2006. See page 75 for discussion of the disposition of the 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline. Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased for 2007, compared with 2006, due to ONEOK Partners capital projects, which are discussed beginning on page 31. 39 Table of Contents Minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased $2.0 million during 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to our acquisition of the remaining interest in Guardian Pipeline. Minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiaries for our ONEOK Partners segment for 2006 included the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline that ONEOK Partners did not own until April 2006. ONEOK Partners owned 100 percent of Guardian Pipeline beginning in April 2006, resulting in no minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries related to Guardian Pipeline after March 31, 2006. The increase of $508.1 million in capital expenditures during 2007, compared with 2006, is driven primarily by ONEOK Partners capital projects that are discussed beginning on page 31. Net margin increased by $296.8 million for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to: an increase of $191.1 million from the legacy ONEOK Partners operations, which were consolidated beginning January 1, 2006, an increase of $101.8 million related to net margins on natural gas liquids gathering and distribution pipelines acquired from Koch in July 2005, an increase of $72.1 million from the operations of the assets ONEOK Partners acquired from us in April 2006, driven primarily by strong commodity prices, higher gross processing spreads and increased natural gas transportation revenues, and a decrease of $80.5 million resulting from the sale of natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas in December 2005. The increase in operating costs of $105.6 million for 2006, compared with 2005, is primarily related to the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations as of January 1, 2006, and the natural gas liquids assets acquired in 2005, offset by the sale of the Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets in December 2005. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $54.6 million for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to $37.9 million related to the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations, $12.0 million for the Black Mesa Pipeline impairment and $15.5 million for the acquisition of natural gas liquids assets from Koch in 2005. These increases were offset by an $8.2 million decrease resulting from the December 2005 sale of natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas. Operating income for 2006 includes the gain on sale of assets of $113.9 million related to ONEOK Partners sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline to TC PipeLines in April 2006. Operating income for 2005 includes a $264.2 million gain on the sale of the natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas to a subsidiary of Eagle Rock Energy, Inc. in December 2005. See Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information. The increase in equity earnings from investments of $97.4 million for 2006, compared with 2005, resulted primarily from ONEOK Partners 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline and gathering and processing joint venture interests in the Powder River and Wind River Basins. The $145.5 million increase in capital expenditures for 2006, compared with 2005, is primarily related to $80.4 million in expenditures by ONEOK Partners legacy operations and $36.7 million in expenditures related to Overland Pass Pipeline Company. For a discussion of market risk, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 40 Table of Contents Distribution Overview Our Distribution segment provides natural gas distribution services to over two million customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas through Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service, respectively. We serve residential, commercial, industrial and transportation customers in all three states. In addition, our distribution companies in Oklahoma and Kansas serve wholesale customers, and in Texas we serve public authority customers. Selected Financial Information The following table sets forth certain selected financial information for our Distribution segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2007 2006 2005 (Thousands of dollars) Gas sales $ 1,976,330 $ 1,836,862 $ 2,094,126 Transportation revenues 87,301 88,306 94,160 Cost of gas 1,435,415 1,358,402 1,628,507 Gross margin 628,216 566,766 559,779 Other revenues 35,432 33,031 27,921 Net margin 663,648 599,797 587,700 Operating costs 377,778 371,460 360,351 Depreciation and amortization 111,615 110,858 113,437 Gain (loss) on sale of assets (56 ) 18 5 Operating income $ 174,199 $ 117,497 $ 113,917 Operating Results Net margin increased by $63.9 million during 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to: an increase of $55.2 million resulting from the implementation of new rate schedules, which includes $51.1 million in Kansas and $4.1 million in Texas and an increase of $8.0 million from higher customer sales volumes as a result of a return to more normal weather in our entire service territory. Operating costs increased $6.3 million during 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to: an increase of $4.8 million in bad debt expense primarily in Oklahoma, an increase of $5.3 million due to higher property taxes in Kansas, and a decrease of $4.0 million in labor and employee benefit costs. Net margin increased $12.1 million for 2006, compared with 2005, due to: an increase of $42.3 million resulting from the implementation of new rate schedules, which was made up of $39.7 million in Oklahoma and $2.6 million in Texas, a decrease of $19.0 million primarily due to expiring riders and lower volumetric rider collections in Oklahoma, a decrease of $10.0 million in customer sales due to warmer weather in our entire service territory, and a decrease of $1.8 million due to reduced wholesale volumes in Kansas. Operating costs increased $11.1 million for 2006, compared with 2005, due to: an increase of $17.2 million in labor and employee benefit costs, an increase of $1.7 million due to increased property taxes, partially offset by a decrease of $7.6 million in bad debt expense. Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.6 million for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to: a decrease of $2.8 million in cathodic protection and service line amortization in Oklahoma from a limited issue rider which expired in the second quarter of 2005, a decrease of $2.9 million related to the replacement of our field customer service system in Texas during the first quarter of 2005, and an offsetting increase of $2.3 million for depreciation expense related to our investment in property, plant and equipment. 41 Table of Contents Selected Operating Data The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for our Distribution segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2007 2006 2005 Average number of customers 2,050,767 2,031,551 2,018,900 Customers per employee 732 713 689 Capital expenditures (Thousands of dollars) $ 162,044 $ 159,026 $ 143,765 Years Ended December 31, Volumes (MMcf) 2007 2006 2005 Gas sales Residential 121,587 110,123 122,010 Commercial 37,295 34,865 39,294 Industrial 1,758 1,624 2,432 Wholesale 13,231 29,263 33,521 Public Authority 2,679 2,520 2,559 Total volumes sold 176,550 178,395 199,816 Transportation 204,049 200,828 252,180 Total volumes delivered 380,599 379,223 451,996 Years Ended December 31, Margin 2007 2006 2005 Gas Sales (Thousands of dollars) Residential $ 440,836 $ 390,229 $ 373,812 Commercial 99,521 88,752 93,014 Industrial 2,330 2,867 3,103 Wholesale 1,212 4,826 6,672 Public Authority 3,675 3,188 3,069 Gross margin on gas sales 547,574 489,862 479,670 Transportation 80,642 76,904 80,109 Gross margin $ 628,216 $ 566,766 $ 559,779 Residential and commercial volumes increased during 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to a return to more normal weather from the unseasonably warm weather in 2006. Residential, commercial and industrial volumes decreased in 2006, compared with 2005, due to warmer weather, primarily in the first quarter of 2006, which affects residential and commercial customers. Wholesale sales represent contracted gas volumes that exceed the needs of our residential, commercial and industrial customer base and are available for sale to other parties. Wholesale volumes decreased during 2007, compared with 2006 and 2005, due to reduced volumes available for sale. Public authority natural gas volumes reflect volumes used by state agencies and school districts served by Texas Gas Service. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditure program includes expenditures for extending service to new areas, modifying customer service lines, increasing system capabilities, general replacements and improvements. It is our practice to maintain and periodically upgrade facilities to assure safe, reliable and efficient operations. Our capital expenditure program included $50.6 million, $54.9 million and $38.6 million for new business development in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital expenditures for new business development in 2007 was impacted by delayed housing starts due to wetter than normal weather and a decrease in housing permits in Oklahoma. Increased new customer installation in the Austin and El Paso areas of Texas and the Tulsa and Oklahoma City areas of Oklahoma were primarily responsible for the increase in new business capital expenditures during 2006, compared with 2005. 42 Table of Contents Regulatory Initiatives Oklahoma On August 17, 2007, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed an application for authorization of a capital investment recovery mechanism as a means to more timely recover and earn a rate of return on the capital investments made for maintaining its distribution system. A joint stipulation was agreed to and signed by all parties in January 2008. This joint stipulation will allow Oklahoma Natural Gas to collect the carrying costs associated with non revenue producing capital expenditures between rate filings. A general hearing on this matter was held on February 15, 2008. The rates are expected to generate approximately $7.6 million in revenues and are expected to be in place in March 2008. Oklahoma Natural Gas was recently authorized by the OCC to implement a natural gas hedge program as a three year pilot program, with up to $10 million per year in hedge costs to be recovered from customers. In a 2005 rate filing, the parties stipulated that transmission pipeline Integrity Management Program (IMP) costs incurred in compliance with the Federal Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 should be addressed in a subsequent proceeding, and in an order issued in October of 2005, the OCC authorized Oklahoma Natural Gas to defer such costs (inclusive of operations and maintenance expense, depreciation, ad valorem taxes and a rate of return). On January 31, 2007, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed an application with the OCC seeking recovery of these costs. On August 31, 2007, the OCC issued an order approving a stipulation of the parties, which provides recovery of $7.2 million in IMP deferrals incurred as of July 31, 2007. The 2008 IMP application was made at the OCC on January 31, 2008, and covered the IMP deferrals for the months of August through December 2007, and the true ups associated with the prior recovery period. This filing also requested $7.2 million to be recovered with a new IMP billing rate to be put in place in July 2008. Oklahoma Natural Gas will continue to defer IMP costs as they are incurred and will file a new application each year for recovery of any additional costs. Kansas In October 2006, Kansas Gas Service reached a settlement with the KCC staff and all other parties to increase annual revenues by approximately $52 million. The terms of the settlement were approved by the KCC in November 2006. The rate increase is effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2007. Texas In August 2007, Texas Gas Service filed for a rate adjustment with the city of El Paso and the municipalities of Anthony, Clint, Horizon City, Socorro and Vinton. Texas Gas Service requested a total increase of $5.5 million. On February 5, 2008, the El Paso City Council approved a rate increase of approximately $3.1 million. The increase is effective for meters read on or after February 15, 2008. Texas Gas Service has received several regulatory approvals to implement rate increases in various municipalities in Texas. A total of $1.7 million in annual rate increases were approved and implemented in the fourth quarter of 2007. A total of $5.5 million in annual rate increases were approved and implemented in 2006. General Certain costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process have been recorded as regulatory assets in accordance with Statement 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Should recovery cease due to regulatory actions, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria of Statement 71 and, accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required.

Years Ended December 31, Financial Results 2007 2006 2005 (Thousands of dollars) Energy and power revenues $ 6,639,884 $ 6,328,893 $ 8,345,091 Energy trading revenues, net (10,613 ) 6,797 12,680 Other revenues 132 117 980 Cost of sales and fuel 6,382,001 6,061,989 8,152,391 Net margin 247,402 273,818 206,360 Operating costs 39,920 42,464 38,719 Depreciation and amortization 2,147 2,149 2,071 Operating income $ 205,335 $ 229,205 $ 165,570 Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2007 2006 2005 Natural gas marketed (Bcf) 1,191 1,132 1,191 Natural gas gross margin ($/Mcf) $ 0.19 $ 0.22 $ 0.14 Physically settled volumes (Bcf) 2,370 2,288 2,387 Capital expenditures (Thousands of dollars) $ 158 $ $ 159 Operating Results Net margin decreased by $26.4 million during 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to: a decrease of $22.0 million in transportation margins, net of hedging activities, associated with changes in the unrealized fair value of derivative instruments and the impact of a force majeure event on the Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline, as more fully described below, a decrease of $5.0 million in retail activities from lower physical margins due to market conditions and increased competition, a decrease of $4.3 million in financial trading margins, that was partially offset by an increase of $4.9 million in storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, related to: o an increase in physical storage margins, net of hedging activity, due to higher realized seasonal storage spreads and optimization activities, partially offset by o a decrease in marketing margins, and o a net increase in the cost associated with managing our peaking and load following services, slightly offset by higher demand fees collected for these services. In September 2007, a portion of the volume contracted under our firm transportation agreement with Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline Company was curtailed due to a fire at a Cheyenne Plains pipeline compressor station. The fire damaged a significant amount of instrumentation and electrical wiring, causing Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline Company to declare a force majeure event on the pipeline. This firm commitment was hedged in accordance with Statement 133. The discontinuance of fair value hedge accounting on the portion of the firm commitment that was impacted by the force majeure event, resulted in a loss of approximately $5.5 million that was recognized in the third quarter. In addition, we incurred a margin loss of approximately $2.4 million in late 2007 on our actual physical transportation. We have filed a claim with our insurance carriers under our business interruption policy for reimbursement of losses incurred during the Cheyenne Plains pipeline capacity curtailments, which is currently being processed. Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline Company resumed full operations in November 2007. Operating costs decreased $2.5 million in 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to decreased legal and employee related costs, and reduced ad valorem tax expense. Net margin increased $67.5 million for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to: an increase of $58.0 million in transportation margins, net of hedging activities, primarily due to improved natural gas basis differentials between Mid Continent and Gulf Coast regions, an increase of $7.1 million in our natural gas trading operations primarily associated with favorable basis spread and fixed price movement in our basis trading and fixed price portfolios, a net increase of $0.9 million related to storage and marketing margins primarily due to: 44 Table of Contents o an increase of $7.1 million due to improved physical storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, and increased demand fees and optimization activities associated with peaking services, partially offset by, o a decrease of $6.2 million related to power margins associated with a tolling transaction that expired December 31, 2005, and an increase of $1.5 million in retail activities due to improved physical margins. Operating costs increased $3.7 million in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to increased employee related costs. Natural gas volumes marketed increased during 2007, compared with 2006, due to an increase in sales activity in the southeastern United States in the third quarter of 2007. Natural gas volumes were also impacted by a 14 percent increase in heating degree days in our service territory, compared with the same period in 2006. Natural gas volumes marketed decreased for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to higher storage injections in the second and third quarters of 2006, warmer temperatures in the majority of our service territory in the first and fourth quarters of 2006, and decreased sales in our Canadian operations. Our natural gas in storage at December 31, 2007, was 66.7 Bcf, compared with 74.1 Bcf at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007, our total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 96 Bcf, compared with 86 Bcf at December 31, 2006. The acquisition of natural gas storage capacity has become more competitive as a result of new entrants, increases in the spread between summer and winter natural gas prices, and natural gas price volatility. The increased demand for storage capacity has resulted in an increase in both the cost of leasing storage capacity and the required term of the lease. Longer terms for our storage capacity leases could result in significant increases in our contractual commitments which are shown on page 52. The following table shows the margins by activity for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Thousands of dollars) Marketing and storage, gross $ 409,051 $ 414,951 $ 350,227 Less: Storage and transportation costs (191,863 ) (180,708 ) (174,838 ) Marketing and storage, net 217,188 234,243 175,389 Retail marketing 13,990 19,006 17,526 Financial trading 16,224 20,569 13,445 Net margin $ 247,402 $ 273,818 $ 206,360 Marketing and storage activities, net, primarily include physical marketing, purchases and sales, firm storage and transportation capacity expense, including the impact of cash flow and fair value hedges, and other derivative instruments used to manage our risk associated with these activities. The combination of owning supply, controlling strategic assets and risk management services allows us to provide commodity diverse products and services to our customers such as peaking and load following services. Retail marketing includes revenues from providing physical marketing and supply services coupled with risk management services to residential and small commercial and industrial customers. Financial trading margin includes activities that are generally executed using financially settled derivatives. These activities are normally short term in nature, with a focus of capturing short term price volatility. Energy trading revenues, net, in our Consolidated Income Statements includes financial trading margins, as well as certain physical natural gas transactions with our trading counterparties. Revenues and cost of sales and fuel from such physical transactions are required to be reported on a net basis. 45 Table of Contents Contingencies Legal Proceedings We are a party to various litigation matters and claims that are normal in the course of our operations. While the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Other As a result of an internal review of a transaction that was brought to the attention of one of our affiliates by a third party, we have commenced an internal review of transactions that may have violated FERC capacity release rules or related rules. While our internal review is ongoing, we believe it is likely that a limited number of these transactions will have violated FERC capacity release rules or related rules. We have notified the FERC of this review and expect to file a report with the FERC by mid March 2008 concerning any violations. At this time, we do not believe that penalties, if any, associated with potential violations will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Overview In September 2005, we completed the sale of our former production segment to TXOK Acquisition, Inc. for $645 million, before adjustments, and recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately $240.3 million. The gain reflects the cash received less adjustments, selling expenses and the net book value of the assets sold. The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce debt. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2005, we made the decision to sell our Spring Creek power plant, located in Oklahoma, and exit the power generation business. In October 2005, we concluded that our Spring Creek power plant had been impaired and recorded an impairment expense of $52.2 million. We subsequently entered into an agreement to sell our Spring Creek power plant to Westar Energy, Inc. for $53 million. The transaction received FERC approval and the sale was completed on October 31, 2006. At the time of the sale, we retained a contract with the Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority (OMPA) that required us to provide OMPA with 75 megawatts of firm capacity per month for a monthly fixed charge of approximately $0.4 million through December 31, 2015. To fulfill our obligations under this contract, we entered into an agreement with Westar to purchase 75 megawatts of firm capacity on the same terms as our agreement with OMPA. In an arbitration ruling dated October 11, 2007, our contract with OMPA was terminated as of that date, and we were awarded payment for our services through that date. We are currently evaluating our alternatives with respect to our contract with Westar. These components of our business are accounted for as discontinued operations. Accordingly, amounts in our consolidated financial statements and related notes for all periods shown relating to our former production segment and our power generation business are reflected as discontinued operations. The sale of our former production segment and the sale of our power generation business are in line with our business strategy to sell assets when deemed to be less strategic or as other conditions warrant. Selected Financial Information The amounts of revenue, costs and income taxes reported in discontinued operations are shown in the table below for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (Thousands of dollars) Operating revenues $ 10,646 $ 135,213 Cost of sales and fuel 7,393 38,398 Net margin 3,253 96,815 Impairment expense 52,226 Operating costs 837 24,302 Depreciation and amortization 17,919 Operating income 2,416 2,368 Other income (expense), net 252 Interest expense 3,013 12,588 Income taxes (232 ) (3,788 ) Income (loss) from operations of discontinued components, net $ (365 ) $ (6,180 ) Gain on sale of discontinued components, net of tax of $90.7 million $ $ 149,577 46 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES General Part of our strategy is to grow through acquisitions and internally generated growth projects that strengthen and complement our existing assets. We have relied primarily on operating cash flow, borrowings from commercial paper and credit agreements, and issuance of debt and equity in the capital markets for our liquidity and capital resource requirements. We expect to continue to use these sources for liquidity and capital resource needs on both a short and long term basis. Beginning in 2007 and continuing in 2008, the capital markets have been impacted by macroeconomic, liquidity and other recessionary concerns. During this period, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners have continued to have access to ONEOKs commercial paper program and the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, respectively, to fund short term liquidity needs. Additionally, ONEOK Partners issued $600 million of long term debt in September 2007. We anticipate that our existing capital resources, ability to obtain financing and cash flow generated from future operations will enable us to maintain our current level of operations and our planned operations including capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. We have no material guarantees of debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated parties. During 2007 and 2006, our capital expenditures were financed through operating cash flows and short and long term debt. Capital expenditures for 2007 were $883.7 million, compared with $376.3 million in 2006, exclusive of acquisitions. Of these amounts, ONEOK Partners capital expenditures during 2007 were $709.9 million, compared with $201.7 million for the same period in 2006, exclusive of acquisitions. The increase in capital expenditures for 2007, compared with 2006, is driven primarily by ONEOK Partners capital projects, which are discussed beginning on page 31. Financing For ONEOK, financing is provided through available cash, commercial paper and long term debt. ONEOK also has a credit agreement, which is used as a back up for its commercial paper program and short term liquidity needs. Other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuance of equity, issuance of mandatory convertible debt securities, issuance of trust preferred securities, asset securitization and sale/leaseback of facilities. ONEOK Partners operations are financed through available cash or the issuance of debt or limited partner units. The total amount of short term borrowings authorized by ONEOKs Board of Directors is $2.5 billion. The total amount of short term borrowings authorized by the Board of Directors of ONEOK Partners GP, the general partner of ONEOK Partners, is $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2007, ONEOK had $102.6 million of commercial paper outstanding, $58.7 million in letters of credit issued and available cash and cash equivalents of approximately $15.9 million. At December 31, 2007, ONEOK Partners had $900 million of credit available under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, $100 million of borrowings outstanding under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, as described in Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and available cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.2 million. As of December 31, 2007, ONEOK could have issued $2.0 billion of additional debt under the most restrictive provisions contained in its various borrowing agreements. As of December 31, 2007, ONEOK Partners could have issued, under the most restrictive provisions of its agreements, $1.1 billion of additional debt. In November 2007, ONEOK Partners entered into a $15 million Senior Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility and Reimbursement Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., of which $12 million is being used, and a $12 million Standby Letter of Credit Agreement with Royal Bank of Canada. Both agreements are used to support various permits required by the KDHE for ONEOK Partners ongoing business in Kansas. In July 2007, ONEOK Partners exercised the accordion feature in the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement to increase the commitment amounts by $250 million to a total of $1.0 billion. ONEOKs $1.2 billion credit agreement (ONEOK Credit Agreement) and the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement contain typical covenants as discussed in Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. At December 31, 2007, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners were in compliance with all covenants. ONEOK Partners Debt Issuance In September 2007, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 6.85 percent Senior Notes due 2037 (the 2037 Notes). The 2037 Notes were issued under ONEOK Partners existing shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The 2037 Notes are non recourse to ONEOK. For more information regarding the 2037 Notes, refer to discussion in Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In September 2006, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of (i) $350 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90 percent Senior Notes due 2012, (ii) $450 million aggregate principal amount of 6.15 percent Senior Notes due 2016 and (iii) $600 million aggregate principal amount of 6.65 percent Senior Notes due 2036 (collectively, the Notes). ONEOK Partners registered the sale of the Notes with the SEC pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed on September 47 Table of Contents 19, 2006. The Notes are non recourse to ONEOK. For more information regarding the Notes, refer to discussion in Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalization Structure The following table sets forth our consolidated capitalization structure for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Long term debt 70 % 65 % Equity 30 % 35 % Debt (including Notes payable) 71 % 65 % Equity 29 % 35 % ONEOK does not guarantee the debt of ONEOK Partners. For purposes of determining compliance with financial covenants in ONEOKs Credit Agreement, the debt of ONEOK Partners is excluded. At December 31, 2007, ONEOKs capitalization structure, excluding the debt of ONEOK Partners, was 51 percent long term debt and 49 percent equity, compared with 48 percent long term debt and 52 percent equity at December 31, 2006. In February 2008, we repaid $402.3 million of maturing long term debt with cash from operations. Credit Ratings Our investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2007, are shown in the table below. ONEOK ONEOK Partners Rating Agency Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Moodys Baa2 Stable Baa2 Stable S&P BBB Stable BBB Stable ONEOKs commercial paper is rated P2 by Moodys and A2 by S&P. Credit ratings may be affected by a material change in financial ratios or a material event affecting the business. The most common criteria for assessment of credit ratings are the debt to capital ratio, business risk profile, pretax and after tax interest coverage, and liquidity. If our credit ratings were downgraded, the interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings would increase, resulting in an increase in our cost to borrow funds, and we could potentially lose access to the commercial paper market. In the event that we are unable to borrow funds under our commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in our business, we have access to a $1.2 billion credit agreement, which expires July 2011, and ONEOK Partners has access to a $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement that expires March 2012. ONEOK Partners $250 million and $225 million long term notes payable, due 2010 and 2011, respectively, contain provisions that require ONEOK Partners to offer to repurchase the senior notes at par value if its Moodys or S&P credit rating falls below investment grade (Baa3 for Moodys or BBB for S&P) and the investment grade rating is not reinstated within a period of 40 days. Further, the indentures governing ONEOK Partners senior notes due 2010 and 2011 include an event of default upon acceleration of other indebtedness of $25 million or more and the indentures governing the senior notes due 2012, 2016, 2036 and 2037 include an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of $100 million or more that would be triggered by such an offer to repurchase. Such an event of default would entitle the trustee or the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior notes due 2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2036 and 2037 to declare those notes immediately due and payable in full. ONEOK Partners may not have sufficient cash on hand to repurchase and repay any accelerated senior notes, which may cause it to borrow money under its credit facilities or seek alternative financing sources to finance the repurchases and repayment. ONEOK Partners could also face difficulties accessing capital or its borrowing costs could increase, impacting its ability to obtain financing for acquisitions or capital expenditures, to refinance indebtedness and to fulfill its debt obligations. A decline in ONEOK Partners credit rating below investment grade may also require ONEOK Partners to provide security to its counterparties in the form of cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments. Our Energy Services segment relies upon the investment grade rating of ONEOKs senior unsecured long term debt to satisfy credit requirements with most of our counterparties. If ONEOKs credit ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to participate in energy marketing and trading activities could be significantly limited. Without an investment grade rating, we may be required to fund margin requirements with our counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments. At December 31, 2007, we could have been required to fund approximately $56.8 million in margin 48 Table of Contents requirements upon such a downgrade. A decline in ONEOKs credit rating below investment grade may also significantly impact other business segments. Other than ONEOK Partners note repurchase obligations and the margin requirement for our Energy Services segment described above, we have determined that we do not have significant exposure to rating triggers under ONEOKs commercial paper agreement, trust indentures, building leases, equipment leases and other various contracts. Rating triggers are defined as provisions that would create an automatic default or acceleration of indebtedness based on a change in our credit rating. ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners credit agreements contain provisions that would cause the cost to borrow funds to increase if their respective credit rating is negatively adjusted. An adverse rating change is not defined as a default of ONEOKs or ONEOK Partners credit agreements. Capital Projects See the Capital Projects section beginning on page 31 for discussion of capital projects. ONEOK Partners Class B Units The units we received from ONEOK Partners were newly created Class B limited partner units. Distributions on the Class B limited partner units were prorated from the date of issuance. As of April 7, 2007, the Class B limited partner units are no longer subordinated to distributions on ONEOK Partners common units and generally have the same voting rights as the common units. At a special meeting of the ONEOK Partners common unitholders held March 29, 2007, the unitholders approved a proposal to permit the conversion of all or a portion of the Class B limited partner units issued in the acquisition and consolidation of certain companies comprising our former gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage segments in a series of transactions (collectively the ONEOK Transactions) into common units at the option of the Class B unitholder. The March 29, 2007, special meeting was adjourned to May 10, 2007, to allow unitholders additional time to vote on a proposal to approve amendments to the ONEOK Partners Partnership Agreement which, had the amendments been approved, would have granted voting rights for units held by us and our affiliates if a vote is held to remove us as the general partner and would have required fair market value compensation for our general partner interest if we are removed as general partner. While a majority of ONEOK Partners common unitholders voted in favor of the proposed amendments to the ONEOK Partners Partnership Agreement at the reconvened meeting of the common unitholders held May 10, 2007, the proposed amendments were not approved by the required two thirds affirmative vote of the outstanding units, excluding the common units and Class B units held by us and our affiliates. As a result, effective April 7, 2007, the Class B limited partner units are entitled to receive increased quarterly distributions and distributions upon liquidation equal to 110 percent of the distributions paid with respect to the common units. On June 21, 2007, we, as the sole holder of ONEOK Partners Class B limited partner units, waived our right to receive the increased quarterly distributions on the Class B units for the period April 7, 2007, through December 31, 2007, and continuing thereafter until we give ONEOK Partners no less than 90 days advance notice that we have withdrawn our waiver. Any such withdrawal of the waiver will be effective with respect to any distribution on the Class B units declared or paid on or after 90 days following delivery of the notice. In addition, since the proposed amendments to the ONEOK Partners Partnership Agreement were not approved by the common unitholders, if the common unitholders vote at any time to remove us or our affiliates as the general partner, quarterly distributions payable on Class B limited partner units would increase to 123.5 percent of the distributions payable with respect to the common units, and distributions payable upon liquidation of the Class B limited partner units would increase to 123.5 percent of the distributions payable with respect to the common units. Stock Repurchase Plan For more information regarding the Stock Repurchase Plan, refer to discussion in Note G of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price volatility. Significant fluctuations in commodity price in either physical or financial energy contracts may impact our overall liquidity due to the impact the commodity price change has on items such as the cost of NGLs and gas held in storage, increased margin requirements, the cost of transportation to various market locations, collectibility of certain energy related receivables and working capital. We believe that our current commercial paper program and ONEOK Partners lines of credit are adequate to meet liquidity requirements associated with commodity price volatility. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans Information about our pension and postretirement benefits plans, including anticipated contributions, is included under Note J of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 49 Table of Contents ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES Information about our environmental liabilities is included in Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows combine cash flows from discontinued operations with cash flows from continuing operations within each category. Discontinued operations accounted for approximately $77.2 million in operating cash inflows for the year ended December 31, 2005. Discontinued operations accounted for approximately $44.4 million in investing cash outflows for the year ended December 31, 2005, and did not account for any financing cash flows. The absence of cash flows from our discontinued operations did not have a significant impact on our future cash flows. Operating Cash Flows Operating cash flows increased by $156.4 million for 2007, compared with 2006. Working capital increased operating cash flows by $209.9 million for 2007, compared with an increase of $59.7 million for 2006. Operating cash flows increased by $1.0 billion for 2006, compared with 2005, primarily as a result of changes in components of working capital which increased operating cash flows by $59.7 million for 2006, compared with a decrease of $580.8 million for 2005, as a result of decreased accounts receivable, decreased inventories and decreased accounts payable. The impact of lower commodity prices on accounts receivable, accounts payable and natural gas inventory positively impacted operating cash flows in 2006, compared with 2005. The increase in 2006 operating cash flows, compared with 2005, was also impacted by the consolidation of ONEOK Partners as of January 1, 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we received $123.4 million in distributions, primarily from Northern Border Pipeline, compared with distributions primarily from ONEOK Partners of $11.0 million in the prior year. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion for 2007, compared with $237.2 million for 2006. The increased use of cash during 2007 was primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures of $507.4 million when compared with 2006. For further discussion of ONEOK Partners capital projects, see page 31. In October 2007, ONEOK Partners acquired an interstate natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products pipeline system and related assets from a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan for approximately $300 million, before working capital adjustments. Our ONEOK Partners segment received $297.0 million for the sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline in April 2006. Our Energy Services segment received $53.0 million for the sale of our discontinued component, Spring Creek, in October 2006. Acquisitions in 2006 primarily relate to our ONEOK Partners segment acquiring the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline not previously owned by ONEOK Partners for approximately $77 million. This purchase increased ONEOK Partners ownership interest to 100 percent. We also purchased from TransCanada its 17.5 percent general partner interest in ONEOK Partners for $40 million. This purchase resulted in our ownership of the entire 2 percent general partner interest in ONEOK Partners. Additionally, ONEOK Partners paid $11.6 million to Williams for a 99 percent interest in, and initial capital expenditures related to, the Overland Pass Pipeline Company natural gas liquids pipeline joint venture. Acquisitions in 2005 primarily represent the purchase of the natural gas liquids assets from Koch. The sale of our former production segment resulted in proceeds from the sale of a discontinued component. The proceeds from the sale of assets in 2005 primarily resulted from the sale of our natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas. Additionally, the sale of Cimarex Energy Company common stock, formerly Magnum Hunter Resources (MHR) common stock, is also included in proceeds from sale of assets. This common stock was acquired upon exercise of MHR stock purchase warrants in February 2005, resulting in our paying $22.7 million, which is included in other investing activities. We had a decrease in short term investments of $31.1 million between December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2007, compared with a total investment of $31.1 million for 2006. During 2007, we had less cash to invest following our repurchase of 7.5 million shares of our outstanding common stock in June. Investing cash flows for 2006 also include the impact of the deconsolidation of Northern Border Pipeline and consolidation of Guardian Pipeline. 50 Table of Contents Financing Cash Flows Cash provided by financing activities was $73.0 million for 2007, compared with cash used in financing activities of $618.8 million for 2006, and cash provided by financing activities of $694.9 million in 2005. In 2007, short term financing was primarily used to fund ONEOK Partners capital projects. ONEOK Partners $598 million debt issuance, net of discounts, was used to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit agreement and finance the $300 million acquisition of assets, before working capital adjustments, from a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan in October 2007. In 2006, we repaid the remaining $900 million outstanding on our $1.0 billion short term bridge financing agreement. During the second quarter of 2006, ONEOK Partners borrowed $1.05 billion under the ONEOK Partners Bridge Facility to finance a portion of the acquisition of the ONEOK Energy Assets and $77 million under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement to acquire the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline not previously owned by ONEOK Partners. During the third quarter of 2006, ONEOK Partners completed the underwritten public offering of senior notes totaling $1.4 billion in net proceeds, before offering expenses, which were used to repay all of the amounts outstanding of the $1.05 billion borrowed under ONEOK Partners Bridge Facility and to repay $335 million of indebtedness outstanding under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. On February 16, 2006, we successfully settled our 16.1 million equity units to 19.5 million shares of our common stock. With the settlement of the equity units, we received $402.4 million in cash, which we used to repay a portion of our commercial paper. We repaid a total of $641.5 million of our commercial paper during 2006. See Note G of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional discussion regarding the equity unit conversion. In March 2006, our ONEOK Partners segment borrowed $33 million under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement to redeem all of the outstanding Viking Gas Transmission Series A, B, C and D senior notes and paid a redemption premium of $3.6 million. During 2005, we borrowed $1.0 billion under our short term bridge financing agreement to assist in financing the acquisition of natural gas liquids assets from Koch. We funded the remaining acquisition cost through our commercial paper program. We reduced our indebtedness under our short term bridge financing agreement by $100.0 million as a result of a required prepayment due to the sale of our former production segment. In June 2005, we issued $800 million of long term notes and used a portion of the proceeds to repay commercial paper. The commercial paper had been issued to finance the Northern Border Partners acquisition, to repay $335 million of long term debt that matured on March 1, 2005, and to meet operating needs. This increase was partially offset by $643 million in payments on notes payable and commercial paper, which represents the cash received from the sale of our former production segment, and payments made in the normal course of operations. In December 2005, we made an early redemption of our $300.0 million long term notes. In addition to the principal payment, we were required to pay a make whole call premium of $5.7 million and accrued interest of $8.7 million, for a total payment of $314.4 million. We funded this early redemption with the proceeds from the sale of our natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas. During 2007, we paid $20.1 million for the settlement of the forward purchase contract related to our stock repurchase in February and approximately $370 million for our stock repurchase in June. We paid $281.4 million to repurchase shares in August 2006. During 2005, we paid $233.0 million to repurchase 7.5 million shares. All of these stock repurchases were pursuant to the plans approved by our Board of Directors. During 2007 and 2006, we paid $182.9 million and $165.3 million in distributions to minority interests, which primarily resulted from our consolidation of ONEOK Partners in accordance with EITF 04 5 as of January 1, 2006, and represents distributions to the unitholders of the 54.3 percent of ONEOK Partners that we do not own. 51 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table sets forth our contractual obligations related to debt, operating leases and other long term obligations as of December 31, 2007.

Interest Payments on Debt Interest expense is calculated by multiplying long term debt by the respective coupon rates, adjusted for active swaps. Operating Leases Our operating leases include a gas processing plant, storage contracts, office space, pipeline equipment, rights of way and vehicles. Operating leases for ONEOK Partners exclude intercompany payments related to the lease of a gas processing plant. In July 2007, ONEOK Leasing Company gave notice of its intent to exercise its option to purchase ONEOK Plaza on or before the end of the current lease term, set to expire on September 30, 2009. In addition, ONEOK Leasing Company has entered into a purchase agreement with the owner of ONEOK Plaza that, if certain conditions are met, would accelerate the purchase of the building to a date on or before March 31, 2008. The total purchase price of approximately $48 million would include $17.1 million for the present value of the lease payments and the $30.9 million base purchase price. These amounts are included in the 2008 column above. Firm Transportation Contracts Our ONEOK Partners, Distribution and Energy Services segments are party to fixed price transportation contracts. However, the costs associated with our Distribution segments contracts are recovered through rates as allowed by the applicable regulatory agency and are excluded from the table above. Firm transportation agreements with ONEOK Partners segments natural gas gathering and processing joint ventures require minimum monthly payments. Financial and Physical Derivatives These are obligations arising from our ONEOK Partners and Energy Services segments physical and financial derivatives, and are based on market information at December 31, 2007. Not included in these amounts are offsetting cash inflows from our Energy Services segments product sales and net positive settlements of $865 million at December 31, 2007. As market information changes daily and is potentially volatile, these values may change significantly. Additionally, product sales may require additional purchase obligations to fulfill sales obligations that are not reflected in these amounts. 52 Table of Contents Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans No payment amounts are provided for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the Thereafter column since there is no termination date for these plans. Purchase Commitments Purchase commitments include purchases related to ONEOK Partners growth capital expenditures and other right of way commitments. Purchase commitments exclude commodity purchase contracts, which are included in the Financial and physical derivatives amounts.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Policy and Oversight We control the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibilities for our risk management limits and policies. Our risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price and credit risk management, and marketing and trading activities. The committee also monitors risk metrics including value at risk (VAR) and mark to market losses. We have a corporate risk control organization led by our vice president of audit, business development and risk control, who is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies and procedures and monitoring certain risk metrics. Key risk control activities include credit review and approval, credit and performance risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics. COMMODITY PRICE RISK Our exposure to market risk discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity prices. Our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in interest rates or commodity prices and the timing of transactions. We are exposed to market risk and the impact of market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices. Market risk refers to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in commodity energy prices. To minimize the risk from market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, we use commodity derivative instruments such as futures contracts, swaps and options to manage market risk of existing or anticipated purchase and sale agreements, existing physical natural gas in storage, and basis risk. We adhere to policies and procedures that limit our exposure to market risk from open positions and that monitor our market risk exposure. ONEOK Partners ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk as its natural gas interstate and intrastate pipelines collect natural gas from its customers for operations or as part of their fee for services provided. When the amount of natural gas consumed in operations by these pipelines differs from the amount provided by its customers, the pipelines must buy or sell natural gas, store or use natural gas from inventory, and are exposed to commodity price risk. At December 31, 2007, there were no hedges in place with respect to natural gas price risk from ONEOK Partners natural gas pipeline business. In addition, ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk primarily as a result of NGLs in storage, spread risk associated with the relative values of the various components of the NGL stream and the relative value of NGL purchases at one location and sales at another location, known as basis risk. ONEOK Partners has not entered into any hedges with respect to its NGL marketing activities. ONEOK Partners is also exposed to commodity price risk, primarily NGLs, as a result of receiving commodities in exchange for its gathering and processing services. To a lesser extent, ONEOK Partners is exposed to the relative price differential between NGLs and natural gas, or the gross processing spread, with respect to its keep whole processing contracts and the risk of price fluctuations and the cost of intervening transportation at various market locations. ONEOK Partners uses commodity fixed price physical forwards and derivative contracts, including NYMEX based futures and over the counter swaps, to minimize earnings volatility in its natural gas gathering and processing business related to natural gas, NGL and condensate price fluctuations. ONEOK Partners reduces its gross processing spread exposure through a combination of physical and financial hedges. ONEOK Partners utilizes a portion of its POP equity natural gas as an offset, or natural hedge, to an equivalent portion of its keep whole shrink requirements. This has the effect of converting ONEOK Partners gross processing spread risk to NGL commodity price risk and ONEOK Partners then uses financial instruments to hedge the sale of NGLs. 55 Table of Contents The following table sets forth ONEOK Partners hedging information for the year ending December 31, 2008. Year Ending December 31, 2008 VolumesHedged Average Price Per Unit VolumesHedged Natural gas liquids (Bbl/d) (a) 8,085 $ 1.28 ($/gallon ) 70 % Condensate (Bbl/d) (a) 818 $ 2.15 ($/gallon ) 74 % Total liquid sales (Bbl/d) 8,903 $ 1.36 ($/gallon ) 71 % (a) Hedged with fixed price swaps. ONEOK Partners commodity price risk is estimated as a hypothetical change in the price of NGLs, crude oil and natural gas at December 31, 2007, excluding the effects of hedging and assuming normal operating conditions. ONEOK Partners condensate sales are based on the price of crude oil. ONEOK Partners estimates the following: a $0.01 per gallon increase in the composite price of NGLs would increase annual net margin by approximately $1.7 million, a $1.00 per barrel increase in the price of crude oil would increase annual net margin by approximately $0.5 million, and a $0.10 per MMBtu increase in the price of natural gas would increase annual net margin by approximately $0.3 million. The above estimates of commodity price risk do not include any effects on demand for its services that might be caused by, or arise in conjunction with, price changes. For example, a change in the gross processing spread may cause ethane to be sold in the natural gas stream, impacting gathering and processing margins, NGL exchange margins, natural gas deliveries and NGL volumes shipped. Distribution Our Distribution segment uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of anticipated natural gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect their customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural gas. Gains or losses associated with these derivative instruments are included in, and recoverable through, the monthly purchased gas cost mechanism. Energy Services Our Energy Services segment is exposed to commodity price risk, including basis risk, arising from natural gas in storage and index based purchases and sales of natural gas at various market locations. We minimize the volatility of our exposure to commodity price risk through the use of derivative instruments, which, under certain circumstances, are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. We are also exposed to commodity price risk from fixed price purchases and sales of natural gas, which we hedge with derivative instruments. Both the fixed price purchases and sales and related derivatives are recorded at fair value. Fair Value Component of the Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities The following table sets forth the fair value component of the energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities, excluding $3.5 million, net of derivative instruments that have been declared as either fair value or cash flow hedges, and $15.7 million, net of deferred option premiums. Fair Value Component of Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities (Thousands of dollars) Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2006 $ (13,133 ) Derivatives realized or otherwise settled during the period 27,251 Fair value of new derivatives entered into during the period 8,287 Other changes in fair value 2,766 Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2007 $ 25,171 The net fair value of derivatives outstanding includes the effect of settled energy contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of market movements on the fair value of energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities. Fair value estimates consider the market in which the transactions are executed. The market in which exchange traded and over the counter transactions are executed is a factor in determining fair 56 Table of Contents value. We utilize third party references for pricing points from NYMEX and third party over the counter brokers to establish the commodity pricing and volatility curves. We believe the reported transactions from these sources are the most reflective of current market prices. Fair values are subject to change based on valuation factors. The estimate of fair value includes an adjustment for the liquidation of the position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions. The fair value estimate also considers the risk of nonperformance based on credit considerations of the counterparty. Maturity of Derivatives The following table provides details of our Energy Services segments maturity of derivatives based on injection and withdrawal periods from April through March. This maturity schedule is consistent with our business strategy. Derivative instruments that have been declared as either fair value or cash flow hedges are not included in the following table. Fair Value of Derivatives at December 31, 2007 Source of Fair Value (a) MaturesthroughMarch 2008 MaturesthroughMarch 2011 MaturesthroughMarch 2013 Total FairValue (Thousands of dollars) Prices actively quoted (b) $ (2,602 ) $ (40 ) $ $ (2,642 ) Prices provided by other external sources (c) (15,693 ) (11,337 ) (110 ) (27,140 ) Prices derived from quotes, other external sources and other assumptions (d) 37,132 17,858 (37 ) 54,953 Total $ 18,837 $ 6,481 $ (147 ) $ 25,171 (a) Fair value is the mark to market component of forwards, futures, swaps and options, net of applicable reserves. These fair values are reflected as a component of assets and liabilities from energy marketing and risk management activities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (b) Values are derived from the energy market price quotes from national commodity trading exchanges that primarily trade futures and option commodity contracts. (c) Values are obtained through energy commodity brokers or electronic trading platforms, whose primary service is to match willing buyers and sellers of energy commodities. Energy price information by location is readily available because of the large energy broker network. (d) Values derived in this category utilize market price information from the other two categories, as well as other assumptions for liquidity and credit. For further discussion of trading activities and assumptions used in our trading activities, see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Also, see Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Value at Risk (VAR) Disclosure of Market Risk We measure market risk in the energy marketing and risk management, trading and non trading portfolios of our Energy Services segment using a VAR methodology, which estimates the expected maximum loss of the portfolio over a specified time horizon within a given confidence interval. Our VAR calculations are based on the Monte Carlo approach. The quantification of market risk using VAR provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance, to determine risk targets and set position limits. The use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions, including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation. Inputs to the calculation include prices, volatilities, positions, instrument valuations and the variance covariance matrix. Historical data is used to estimate our VAR with more weight given to recent data, which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements. We rely on VAR to determine the potential reduction in the portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period. While management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable, no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating VAR. Different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different VAR estimates. Our VAR exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized for our non regulated businesses energy marketing and risk management, non trading and trading portfolios of derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and natural gas in storage due to adverse market movements. A one day time horizon and a 95 percent confidence level were used in our VAR data. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the VAR calculation 57 Table of Contents based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices, operating exposures and timing thereof, and the changes in our derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and natural gas in storage. VAR information should be evaluated in light of these assumptions and the methodologys other limitations. The potential impact on our future earnings, as measured by the VAR, was $6.0 million and $12.5 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following table details the average, high and low VAR calculations for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Average $ 8.9 $ 18.5 High $ 23.0 $ 65.0 Low $ 3.4 $ 3.6 Our VAR calculation includes derivatives, executory storage and transportation agreements and their related hedges. The variations in the VAR data are reflective of market volatility and changes in the portfolios during the year. The decrease in VAR for 2007, compared with 2006, was due to lower commodity prices and decreased price volatility in 2007, particularly in the first quarter of 2007. To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably. As a result, we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position. INTEREST RATE RISK General We are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the normal course of business. We manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates. At December 31, 2007, the interest rate on 82.9 percent of our long term debt, exclusive of the debt of our ONEOK Partners segment, was fixed after considering the impact of interest rate swaps. ONEOK Partners terminated two floating rate swaps in 2007. The total value ONEOK Partners received for the terminated swaps was not material. At December 31, 2007, the interest rate on all of ONEOK Partners long term debt was fixed. At December 31, 2007, a 100 basis point move in the annual interest rate on all of our outstanding long term debt would change our annual interest expense by $3.4 million before taxes. This 100 basis point change assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. If interest rates changed significantly, we would take actions to manage our exposure to the change. Since a specific action and the possible effects are uncertain, no change has been assumed. Fair Value Hedges See Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for discussion of the impact of interest rate swaps and net interest expense savings from terminated swaps. Total net swap savings for 2007 were $8.2 million, compared with $7.6 million for 2006. Total swap savings for 2008 is expected to be $14.3 million. CURRENCY RATE RISK As a result of our Energy Services segments expansion into Canada, we are subject to currency exposure from our commodity purchases and sales related to our firm transportation and storage contracts. Our objective with respect to currency risk is to reduce the exposure due to exchange rate fluctuations. We use physical forward transactions, which result in an actual two way flow of currency on the settlement date since we exchange U.S. dollars for Canadian dollars with another party. We have not designated these transactions for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, the gains and losses associated with the change in fair value are recorded in net margin. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, our exposure to risk from currency translation was not material. We recognized currency translation gains of $4.1 million and $2.5 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2005, there was no material currency translation gain or loss recorded. 58 Table of Contents
