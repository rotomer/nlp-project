ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The following discussion highlights some of our achievements this past year. Please refer to the Financial Results and Operating Information, Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Capital Projects sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Operating Results Diluted earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations (EPS) increased to $2.95 in 2008, compared with $2.79 in 2007. Operating income for 2008 increased to $917.0 million from $822.5 million for 2007. This increase is primarily due to wider NGL product price differentials, higher realized commodity prices, increased NGL gathering and fractionation volumes, and incremental operating income associated with the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (Kinder Morgan), all in our ONEOK Partners segment. This increase in operating income was partially offset by decreases in storage and marketing margins and transportation margins, net of hedging activities, in our Energy Services segment. ONEOK Partners Equity Issuance In March 2008, we purchased from ONEOK Partners, in a private placement, an additional 5.4 million of ONEOK Partners common units for a total purchase price of approximately $303.2 million. In addition, ONEOK Partners completed a public offering of 2.5 million common units at $58.10 per common unit and received net proceeds of $140.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts but before offering expenses. In conjunction with ONEOK Partners private placement and public offering of common units, ONEOK Partners GP contributed $9.4 million to ONEOK Partners in order to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest. In April 2008, ONEOK Partners sold an additional 128,873 common units at $58.10 per common unit to the underwriters of the public offering upon the partial exercise of their option to purchase additional common units to cover over allotments. ONEOK Partners received net proceeds of approximately $7.2 million from the sale of these common units after deducting underwriting discounts but before offering expenses. In conjunction with the partial exercise by the underwriters, ONEOK Partners GP contributed $0.2 million to ONEOK Partners in order to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest. Following these transactions, our interest in ONEOK Partners is 47.7 percent. 35 Table of Contents ONEOK Partners used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of common units and the general partner contributions to repay borrowings under its $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement dated March 30, 2007, as amended July 31, 2007 (the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement). Dividends/Distributions During 2008, we paid dividends totaling $1.56 per share, an increase of approximately 11 percent over the $1.40 per share paid during 2007. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share ($1.60 per share on an annualized basis) in January 2009, an increase of approximately 5 percent over the $0.38 declared in January 2008. During 2008, ONEOK Partners paid cash distributions totaling $4.205 per unit, an increase of approximately 6 percent over the $3.98 per unit paid during 2007. ONEOK Partners declared a cash distribution of $1.08 per unit ($4.32 per unit on an annualized basis) in January 2009, an increase of approximately 5 percent over the $1.025 declared in January 2008. Capital Projects ONEOK Partners placed the following projects in service during 2008: January Midwestern Gas Transmissions eastern extension pipeline; July final phase of Fort Union Gas Gathering expansion project; September Woodford Shale natural gas liquids pipeline extension; October Bushton Fractionation expansion; November Overland Pass Pipeline from Opal, Wyoming to Conway, Kansas; and December partial operations of the Guardian pipeline extension with interruptible service from Ixonia, Wisconsin, to Green Bay, Wisconsin. Key Performance Indicators Key performance indicators reviewed by management include: earnings per share; return on invested capital; and shareholder appreciation. For 2008, our basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.99 and $2.95, respectively, representing a 5 percent increase in basic earnings per share and a 6 percent increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared with 2007. For 2007, our basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.84 and $2.79, respectively, representing a 4 percent increase in basic earnings per share and a 4 percent increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared with 2006. Return on invested capital was 13 percent in 2008 and 14 percent in 2007 and 2006, respectively. To evaluate shareholder appreciation, we compare the total return over a three year period of an investment in our stock with the total return of an investment in the stock of a group of peer companies. For the three year period ended December 31, 2008, we ranked fifth in this shareholder appreciation calculation when compared with 18 of our peers. Outlook for 2009 We expect continued deteriorating economic conditions in 2009, with significant downward pressures, relative to 2008, on commodity prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. We anticipate that lower commodity prices will result in reduced drilling activity, and economic conditions will reduce petrochemical demand. We also expect continued volatility and disruption in the financial markets which could result in an increased cost of capital. We expect depressed commodity prices and tighter capital markets to also result in the sale or consolidation of underperforming assets in the industry, which may present opportunities for us. SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES Acquisition of NGL Pipeline In October 2007, ONEOK Partners completed the acquisition of an interstate natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products pipeline system and related assets from a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan for approximately $300 million, before working capital adjustments. The system extends from Bushton and Conway, Kansas, to Chicago, Illinois, and transports, stores and delivers a full range of NGL products and refined petroleum products. The FERC regulated system spans 1,624 miles and has a capacity to transport up to 134 MBbl/d. The transaction also included approximately 978 MBbl of owned storage capacity, eight NGL terminals and a 50 percent ownership of Heartland. ConocoPhillips owns the other 50 percent of Heartland and is the managing partner of the Heartland joint venture, which consists primarily of a refined petroleum products terminal and pipelines with access to two other refined petroleum products terminals. ONEOK Partners investment in Heartland is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Financing for this transaction came from a portion of the proceeds of ONEOK Partners September 2007 issuance of $600 million 6.85 percent Senior Notes due 2037 (the 2037 Notes). See Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a discussion of the 2037 Notes. The working capital settlement was finalized in April 2008, with no material adjustments. 36 Table of Contents Overland Pass Pipeline Company See Capital Projects for discussion of Overland Pass Pipeline Company. ONEOK Partners In April 2006, we sold certain assets comprising our former gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage segments to ONEOK Partners for approximately $3 billion, including $1.35 billion in cash, before adjustments, and approximately 36.5 million Class B limited partner units in ONEOK Partners. The Class B limited partner units and the related general partner interest contribution were valued at approximately $1.65 billion. We also purchased, through ONEOK Partners GP, from an affiliate of TransCanada, 17.5 percent of the general partner interest in ONEOK Partners for $40 million. This purchase resulted in our ownership of the entire 2 percent general partner interest in ONEOK Partners. Following the completion of the transactions, we owned a total of approximately 37.0 million common and Class B limited partner units and the entire 2 percent general partner interest and control of the partnership. Our overall interest in ONEOK Partners, including the 2 percent general partner interest, was 45.7 percent at the date of acquisition. The sale of certain assets comprising our former gathering and processing, pipelines and storage, and natural gas liquids segments did not affect our consolidated operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income or total assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we were already required under EITF 04 5 to consolidate our investment in ONEOK Partners effective January 1, 2006. However, minority interest expense and net income were affected. See Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K beginning on page 76 for additional discussion of our consolidation of ONEOK Partners. Disposition of 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline In April 2006, in connection with the transactions described immediately above, our ONEOK Partners segment completed the sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline to TC PipeLines for approximately $297 million. Our ONEOK Partners segment recorded a gain on sale of approximately $113.9 million in the second quarter of 2006. ONEOK Partners and TC PipeLines each now own a 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline, and an affiliate of TransCanada became operator of the pipeline in April 2007. As a result of this transaction, ONEOK Partners interest in Northern Border Pipeline is accounted for as an investment under the equity method applied on a retroactive basis to January 1, 2006. Acquisition of Guardian Pipeline Interests In April 2006, our ONEOK Partners segment acquired the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline not previously owned by ONEOK Partners for approximately $77 million, increasing its ownership interest to 100 percent. ONEOK Partners used borrowings from its credit facility to fund the acquisition of the additional interest in Guardian Pipeline. Following the completion of the transaction, we consolidated Guardian Pipeline in our consolidated financial statements. This change was accounted for on a retroactive basis to January 1, 2006. CAPITAL PROJECTS All of the capital projects discussed below are in our ONEOK Partners segment. Woodford Shale Natural Gas Liquids Pipeline Extension The 78 mile natural gas liquids gathering pipeline connecting two natural gas processing plants, operated by Devon Energy Corporation and Antero Resources Corporation, was placed into service in September 2008. The cost of the project was approximately $36 million, excluding AFUDC. These two plants have the capacity to produce approximately 25 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs. The natural gas liquids production is gathered by ONEOK Partners existing Mid Continent natural gas liquids gathering pipelines. Upon completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline project, the Woodford Shale natural gas liquids production is expected to be transported through the Arbuckle Pipeline to ONEOK Partners Mont Belvieu, Texas, fractionation facility. Overland Pass Pipeline Company In May 2006, a subsidiary of ONEOK Partners entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of The Williams Companies, Inc. (Williams) to form a joint venture called Overland Pass Pipeline Company. In November 2008, Overland Pass Pipeline Company completed construction of a 760 mile natural gas liquids pipeline from Opal, Wyoming, to the Mid Continent natural gas liquids market center in Conway, Kansas. The Overland Pass Pipeline is designed to transport approximately 110 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs and can be increased to approximately 255 MBbl/d with additional pump facilities. During 2006, ONEOK Partners paid $11.6 million to Williams for the acquisition of its interest in the joint venture and for reimbursement of initial capital expenditures. A subsidiary of ONEOK Partners owns 99 percent of the joint venture, managed the construction project, advanced all costs associated with construction and is currently operating the pipeline. On or before November 17, 2010, Williams will have the option to increase its ownership up to 50 percent, with the purchase price determined in accordance with the joint ventures operating agreement. If Williams exercises its option to increase its ownership to the full 50 percent, Williams would have the option to become operator. The pipeline project cost was approximately $575 million, excluding AFUDC. As part of a long term agreement, Williams dedicated its NGL production from two of its natural gas processing plants in Wyoming, estimated to be approximately 60 MBbl/d, to the Overland Pass Pipeline. Subsidiaries of ONEOK Partners will 37 Table of Contents provide downstream fractionation, storage and transportation services to Williams. ONEOK Partners has also reached agreements with certain producers for supply commitments of up to an additional 80 MBbl/d and is negotiating agreements with other producers for supply commitments that could add an additional 60 MBbl/d of supply to this pipeline within the next three to five years. ONEOK Partners also invested approximately $239 million, excluding AFUDC, to expand its existing fractionation and storage capabilities and to increase the capacity of its natural gas liquids distribution pipelines. Part of this expansion included adding new fractionation facilities at ONEOK Partners Bushton location, increasing total fractionation capacity at Bushton to 150 MBbl/d. The addition of the new facilities and the upgrade to the existing fractionator was completed in October 2008. Additionally, portions of the natural gas liquids distribution pipeline upgrades were completed in the second and third quarters of 2008. Piceance Lateral Pipeline In March 2007, ONEOK Partners announced that Overland Pass Pipeline Company also plans to construct a 150 mile lateral pipeline with capacity to transport as much as 100 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs from the Piceance Basin in Colorado to the Overland Pass Pipeline. Williams announced that it intends to construct a new natural gas processing plant in the Piceance Basin and will dedicate its NGL production from that plant and an existing plant, with estimated volumes totaling approximately 30 MBbl/d, to be transported by the lateral pipeline. ONEOK Partners continues to negotiate with other producers for supply commitments. In October 2008, this project received approval of various state and federal regulatory authorities allowing construction to commence. Construction began during the fourth quarter of 2008 and is expected be completed during the third quarter of 2009. The project is currently estimated to cost in the range of $110 million to $140 million, excluding AFUDC. D J Basin Lateral Pipeline In September 2008, ONEOK Partners announced plans to construct a 125 mile natural gas liquids lateral pipeline from the Denver Julesburg Basin in northeastern Colorado to the Overland Pass Pipeline, with capacity to transport as much as 55 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs. The project is currently estimated to cost in the range of $70 million to $80 million, excluding AFUDC. ONEOK Partners has supply commitments for up to 33 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs with potential for an additional 10 MBbl/d of supply from new drilling and plant upgrades in the next two years. The pipeline is currently under construction and is expected to be fully completed during the first quarter of 2009. Arbuckle Pipeline Natural Gas Liquids Pipeline In March 2007, ONEOK Partners announced plans to build the 440 mile Arbuckle Pipeline, a natural gas liquids pipeline from southern Oklahoma through northern Texas and continuing on to the Texas Gulf Coast. The Arbuckle Pipeline will have the capacity to transport 160 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs, expandable to 210 MBbl/d with additional pump facilities, and will connect with ONEOK Partners existing Mid Continent infrastructure with its fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas, and other Gulf Coast region fractionators. ONEOK Partners has supply commitments from producers that it expects will be sufficient to fill the 210 MBbl/d capacity level over the next three to five years. Construction on the pipeline has been underway since the third quarter of 2008. Much of the Oklahoma and north Texas portions are either complete or nearing completion. However, right of way acquisition has been challenging, time consuming and expensive, which could affect the completion schedule and final cost of the project. Many of Arbuckle Pipelines remaining right of way tracts are being acquired through a condemnation process, which adds to the cost and time to construct the pipeline. The demand for surface easements has increased dramatically in Texas and Oklahoma in the last 12 to 18 months because of increased oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, as well as pipeline construction. Because of the delays associated with right of way acquisition, we anticipate construction on the south end of the project will be more difficult and expensive due to wet low lying areas and potential for spring rains. Accordingly, we expect the project to be operational in the second quarter of 2009. Based on the increased costs and delays associated with right of way acquisition and potential weather impacts, our project costs could increase 10 percent to 15 percent above the range of $340 million to $360 million, excluding AFUDC, as previously reported. Williston Basin Gas Processing Plant Expansion In March 2007, ONEOK Partners announced the expansion of its Grasslands natural gas processing facility in North Dakota, currently estimated to cost in the range of $40 million to $45 million, excluding AFUDC. ONEOK Partners estimated project costs increased from $30 million primarily as a result of higher contract labor and equipment costs. The Grasslands facility is ONEOK Partners largest natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin. The expansion increases processing capacity to approximately 100 MMcf/d from its current capacity of 63 MMcf/d and increases fractionation capacity to approximately 12 MBbl/d from 8 MBbl/d. The construction of the expansion project is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2009. Fort Union Gas Gathering Expansion In January 2007, Fort Union Gas Gathering announced plans to double its existing gathering pipeline capacity by adding 148 miles of new gathering lines, resulting in approximately 649 MMcf/d of additional capacity in the Powder River basin of Wyoming. The expansion occurred in two phases and cost approximately $121 million, excluding AFUDC, which was financed within the Fort Union Gas Gathering partnership. Any cost overruns are covered through escalation clauses to preserve the original economics of the project. Phase I, with more than 200 MMcf/d 38 Table of Contents capacity, was placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2007. Phase II, with approximately 450 MMcf/d capacity, was completed in July 2008. The additional capacity has been fully subscribed for 10 years. ONEOK Partners owns approximately 37 percent of Fort Union Gas Gathering, and accounts for its ownership under the equity method of accounting. Guardian Pipeline Expansion and Extension In December 2007, Guardian Pipeline received and accepted the certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the FERC for its expansion and extension project. The certificate authorizes ONEOK Partners to construct, install and operate approximately 119 miles of a 20 inch and 30 inch natural gas transportation pipeline with a capacity to transport 537 MMcf/d of natural gas north from Ixonia, Wisconsin to the Green Bay, Wisconsin, area. The project is supported by 15 year shipper commitments with We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and the capacity has been fully subscribed. The project is currently estimated to cost in the range of $277 million and $305 million, excluding AFUDC. ONEOK Partners estimated project costs increased from the initial estimate of $241 million in 2006, which excluded AFUDC, primarily due to weather delays, equipment delivery delays, construction in environmentally sensitive areas, rocky terrain, and escalating costs associated with crop damage and condemnation costs. ONEOK Partners received the notice to proceed from the FERC in May 2008. On December 22, 2008, the FERC issued a letter order granting Guardian Pipelines request for an extension of time for a phased in service. On December 29, 2008, the FERC issued a letter order granting Guardian Pipelines request to commence service. On December 31, 2008, the pipeline and seven meter stations were placed into service with the ability to transport natural gas on a limited basis. Construction on one compressor station is complete, and construction on a second compressor station is near completion. The project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter of 2009. REGULATORY Several regulatory initiatives positively impacted the earnings and future earnings potential for our Distribution segment. See discussion of our Distribution segments regulatory initiative beginning on page 49. IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Information about the impact of the following new accounting standards is included in Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K: Statement 123R, Share Based Payment; Statement 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans; FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109; Statement 157, Fair Value Measurements, and related FASB Staff Position (FSP) 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement no. 157, and FSP 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active; Statement 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities; FSP FIN 39 1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39; Statement 141R, Business Combinations; Statement 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment to ARB No. 51; Statement 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment to FASB Statement No. 133; EITF 08 6, Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations; and Statement 132R 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates. The following is a summary of our most critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those estimates most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters. We have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 39 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements General In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement 157 that establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. Beginning January 1, 2008, we partially applied Statement 157 as allowed by FSP 157 2 that delayed the effective date of Statement 157 for nonrecurring fair value measurements associated with our nonfinancial assets and liabilities. As of January 1, 2008, we applied the provisions of Statement 157 to our recurring fair value measurements, and the impact was not material upon adoption. As of January 1, 2009, we have applied the provisions of Statement 157 to our nonrecurring fair value measurements associated with our nonfinancial assets and liabilities, and the impact was not material. FSP 157 3, which clarified the application of Statement 157 in inactive markets, was issued in October 2008 and was effective for our September 30, 2008, consolidated financial statements. FSP 157 3 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement 159 that allows companies to elect to measure specified financial assets and liabilities, firm commitments, and nonfinancial warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. At January 1, 2008, we did not elect the fair value option under Statement 159, and therefore there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements. Determining Fair Value Statement 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We use the market and income approaches to determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities and consider the markets in which the transactions are executed. While many of the contracts in our portfolio are executed in liquid markets where price transparency exists, some contracts are executed in markets for which market prices may exist but the market may be relatively inactive. This results in limited price transparency that requires managements judgment and assumptions to estimate fair values. Inputs into our fair value estimates include commodity exchange prices, over the counter quotes, volatility, historical correlations of pricing data and LIBOR and other liquid money market instrument rates. We also utilize internally developed basis curves that incorporate observable and unobservable market data. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources, where available. In addition, as prescribed by the income approach, we compute the fair value of our derivative portfolio by discounting the projected future cash flows from our derivative assets and liabilities to present value. The interest rate yields used to calculate the present value discount factors are derived from LIBOR, Eurodollar futures and Treasury swaps. The projected cash flows are then multiplied by the appropriate discount factors to determine the present value or fair value of our derivative instruments. We also take into consideration the potential impact on market prices of liquidating positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions. Finally, we consider credit risk of our counterparties on the fair value of our derivative assets, as well as our own credit risk for derivative liabilities, using default probabilities and recovery rates, net of collateral. We also take into consideration current market data in our evaluation when available, such as bond prices and yields and credit default swaps. Although we use our best estimates to determine the fair value of the derivative contracts we have executed, the ultimate market prices realized could differ from our estimates, and the differences could be material. Fair Value Hierarchy Statement 157 establishes the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques based on observable and unobservable data and categorizes the inputs into three levels, with the highest priority given to Level 1 and the lowest priority given to Level 3. The levels are described below. Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Significant observable pricing inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Essentially, this represents inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data; and Level 3 Generally unobservable inputs, which are developed based on the best information available and may include our own internal data. Determining the appropriate classification of our fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy requires managements judgment regarding the degree to which market data is observable or corroborated by observable market data. Transfers in and out of Level 3 typically result from derivatives for which fair value is determined based on multiple inputs. If prices change for a particular input from the previous measurement date to the current measurement date, the impact could result in the derivative being moved between Level 2 and Level 3, depending upon management judgment of the significance of the price change of that particular input to the total fair value of the derivative. See Note C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more discussion of fair value measurements. Derivatives, Accounting for Financially Settled Transactions and Risk Management Activities We engage in wholesale energy marketing, retail marketing, trading and risk management activities. We account for derivative instruments utilized in connection with these activities and services in accordance with Statement 133, as amended. 40 Table of Contents Under Statement 133, entities are required to record derivative instruments at fair value, with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery. See previous discussion in Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Market value changes result in a change in the fair value of our derivative instruments. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the nature of the risk being hedged and how we will determine if the hedging instrument is effective. If the derivative instrument does not qualify or is not designated as part of a hedging relationship, then we account for changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings as they occur. Commodity price volatility may have a significant impact on the gain or loss in any given period. For more information on fair value sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and condensate prices, we periodically enter into futures, forwards, options or swap transactions in order to hedge anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs and condensate and fuel requirements. Interest rate swaps are also used to manage interest rate risk. Under certain conditions, we designate these derivative instruments as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values or cash flow. For hedges of exposure to changes in cash flow, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently recorded to earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness of designated hedges is reported in earnings during the period the ineffectiveness occurs. For hedges of exposure to changes in fair value, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings during the period of change together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. Upon election, many of our purchase and sale agreements that otherwise would be required to follow derivative accounting qualify as normal purchases and normal sales under Statement 133 and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment. The presentation of settled derivative instruments on either a gross or net basis in our Consolidated Statements of Income is dependent on a number of factors, including whether the derivative instrument (i) is held for trading purposes; (ii) is financially settled; (iii) results in physical delivery or services rendered; and (iv) qualifies for the normal purchase or sale exception as defined in Statement 133. In accordance with EITF 03 11, Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and not Held for Trading as Defined in EITF Issue No. 02 3, EITF 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and Statement 133, we report settled derivative instruments as follows: all financially settled derivative contracts are reported on a net basis; derivative instruments considered held for trading purposes that result in physical delivery are reported on a net basis; derivative instruments not considered held for trading purposes that result in physical delivery or services rendered are reported on a gross basis; and derivatives that qualify for the normal purchase or sale exception as defined in Statement 133 are reported on a gross basis. We apply the indicators in EITF 99 19 to determine the appropriate accounting treatment for non derivative contracts that result in physical delivery. See Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional discussion of derivatives and risk management activities. Impairment of Long Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets We assess our long lived assets for impairment based on Statement 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. A long lived asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may exceed its fair value. Fair values are based on the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. We assess our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually based on Statement 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. There were no impairment charges resulting from our July 1, 2008, impairment test. As a result of recent events in the financial markets and current economic conditions, we performed a review and determined that interim testing of goodwill as of December 31, 2008, was not necessary. As a part of our impairment test, an initial assessment is made by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the book value, an impairment is indicated, and we must perform a second test to measure the amount of the 41 Table of Contents impairment. In the second test, we calculate the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value determined in step one of the assessment. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we will record an impairment charge. We use two generally accepted valuation approaches, an income approach and a market approach, to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. Under the income approach, we use anticipated cash flows over a three year period plus a terminal value and discount these amounts to their present value using appropriate rates of return. Under the market approach, we apply multiples to forecasted EBITDA amounts. The multiples used are consistent with historical asset transactions, and the EBITDA amounts are based on average EBITDA for a reporting unit over a three year forecasted period. At December 31, 2008 we had $602.8 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as shown below. (Thousands of dollars) ONEOK Partners $ 433,537 Distribution 157,953 Energy Services 10,255 Other 1,099 Total goodwill $ 602,844 Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life, while intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized. All intangible assets are subject to impairment testing. We had $435.4 million of intangible assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008, of which $279.8 million in our ONEOK Partners segment is being amortized over an aggregate weighted average period of 40 years, while the remaining balance has an indefinite life. Our impairment tests require the use of assumptions and estimates. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an impairment charge. During 2006, we recorded a goodwill and asset impairment related to ONEOK Partners Black Mesa Pipeline of $8.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively, which was recorded as depreciation and amortization. The reduction to our net income, net of minority interests and income taxes, was $3.0 million. For the investments we account for under the equity method, the premium or excess cost over underlying fair value of net assets is referred to as equity method goodwill and under Statement 142, is not subject to amortization but rather to impairment testing pursuant to APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. The impairment test under APB Opinion No. 18 considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. Therefore, we periodically reevaluate the amount at which we carry the excess of cost over fair value of net assets accounted for under the equity method to determine whether current events or circumstances warrant adjustments to our carrying value in accordance with APB Opinion No. 18. Pension and Postretirement Employee Benefits We have defined benefit retirement plans covering certain full time employees. We sponsor welfare plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees who retire with at least five years of service. Our actuarial consultant calculates the expense and liability related to these plans and uses statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, age and employment periods. In determining the projected benefit obligations and costs, assumptions can change from period to period and result in material changes in the costs and liabilities we recognize. See Note J of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for our health care plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects. One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Thousands of dollars) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 1,989 $ (1,706 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 19,585 $ (17,171 ) 42 Table of Contents During 2008, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $19.8 million related to our defined benefit pension plans and $28.3 million related to postretirement benefits. We estimate that in 2009, we will record net periodic benefit costs of $26.6 million related to our defined benefit pension plans and $26.1 million related to postretirement benefits. In determining our estimated expenses for 2009, our actuarial consultant assumed an 8.50 percent expected return on plan assets and a discount rate of 6.25 percent. A decrease in our expected return on plan assets to 8.25 percent would increase our 2009 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $1.9 million for our defined benefit pension plans and would not have a significant impact on our postretirement benefit plan. A decrease in our assumed discount rate to 6.00 percent would increase our 2009 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $2.4 million for our defined benefit pension plans and $0.6 million for our postretirement benefit plan. For 2009, we anticipate our total contributions to our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plan to be $31.2 million and $11.4 million, respectively, and the expected benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plan are estimated to be $16.2 million. Contingencies Our accounting for contingencies covers a variety of business activities, including contingencies for legal and environmental exposures. We accrue these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with Statement 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We base our estimates on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remediation feasibility study. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. Actual results may differ from our estimates resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on earnings. See Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional discussion of contingencies. FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATING INFORMATION Consolidated Operations Selected Financial Results The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for the periods indicated. Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Financial Results 2008 2007 2006 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Revenues $ 16,157.4 $ 13,477.4 $ 11,920.3 $ 2,680.0 20 % $ 1,557.1 13 % Cost of sales and fuel 14,221.9 11,667.3 10,198.3 2,554.6 22 % 1,469.0 14 % Net margin 1,935.5 1,810.1 1,722.0 125.4 7 % 88.1 5 % Operating costs 776.9 761.5 740.8 15.4 2 % 20.7 3 % Depreciation and amortization 243.9 228.0 235.5 15.9 7 % (7.5 ) (3 %) Gain (loss) on sale of assets 2.3 1.9 116.5 0.4 21 % (114.6 ) (98 %) Operating income $ 917.0 $ 822.5 $ 862.2 $ 94.5 11 % $ (39.7 ) (5 %) Equity earnings from investments $ 101.4 $ 89.9 $ 95.9 $ 11.5 13 % $ (6.0 ) (6 %) Allowance for equity funds used during construction $ 50.9 $ 12.5 $ 2.2 $ 38.4 * $ 10.3 * Other income (expense) $ (10.6 ) $ 14.1 $ 1.9 $ (24.7 ) * $ 12.2 * Interest expense $ (264.2 ) $ (256.3 ) $ (239.7 ) $ 7.9 3 % $ 16.6 7 % Minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries $ (288.6 ) $ (193.2 ) $ (222.0 ) $ 95.4 49 % $ (28.8 ) (13 %) Capital expenditures $ 1,473.1 $ 883.7 $ 376.3 $ 589.4 67 % $ 507.4 * * Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 2008 vs. 2007 Net margin increased primarily due to wider NGL product price differentials, higher realized commodity prices, incremental net margin associated with the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan, and increased NGL gathering and fractionation volumes, all in our ONEOK Partners segment. Additionally, net margin increased due to implementation of new rate mechanisms in our Distribution segment. These increases were partially offset by decreases in storage and marketing margins and transportation margins, net of hedging activities, in our Energy Services segment. 43 Table of Contents Operating costs increased primarily due to incremental operating expenses associated with the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan, outside services primarily associated with scheduled maintenance expenses at ONEOK Partners Medford and Mont Belvieu fractionators, and chemical costs. Operating costs also increased due to costs associated with the startup of the newly expanded Bushton fractionator and Overland Pass Pipeline, both in our ONEOK Partners segment. Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan and depreciation expense associated with ONEOK Partners completed capital projects. Additionally, our Distribution segment had an increase in depreciation and amortization, primarily due to additional investment in property, plant and equipment. Equity earnings from investments increased primarily due to ONEOK Partners share of the gain on the sale of Bison Pipeline LLC by Northern Border Pipeline and ONEOK Partners earnings related to higher gathering revenues in its natural gas gathering and processing business various investments, partially offset by reduced throughput on Northern Border Pipeline. ONEOK Partners owns a 50 percent equity interest in Northern Border Pipeline. Allowance for equity funds used during construction and capital expenditures increased due to ONEOK Partners capital projects. Other income (expense) fluctuated primarily due to investment gains (losses) and fluctuations in interest income. In addition, other income (expense) was impacted by realized and unrealized gains on available for sale securities sold and transferred to trading. Our available for sale securities were reclassified to trading securities due to a reconsideration event in August 2008 when our NYMEX Holding, Inc. Class A shares held were converted to CME Group, Inc. (CME) Class A shares, due to the NYMEX Holding, Inc. and CME merger. A modification was made to the number of shares required to be maintained by NYMEX Holding, Inc. Class A Members, which resulted in our sale of certain shares and the reclassification of the remaining shares to trading. Interest expense increased primarily due to increased borrowings to fund ONEOK Partners capital projects. Minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries for 2008 and 2007 reflects the remaining 52.3 percent and 54.3 percent, respectively, of ONEOK Partners that we did not own. The increase in minority interest is due to the increase in income for our ONEOK Partners segment, partially offset by our increased equity ownership interest in ONEOK Partners. 2007 vs. 2006 Net margin increased primarily due to the implementation of new rate schedules in Kansas and Texas in our Distribution segment. Net margin was also positively impacted by our ONEOK Partners segment due to its natural gas liquids businesses, which benefited primarily from new supply connections that increased volumes gathered, transported, fractionated and sold. Net margin also increased due to ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids gathering and fractionation business benefiting from higher product price differentials and higher isomerization price differentials, as well as the incremental net margin related to the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan in October 2007. These increases were offset by decreased transportation margins in our Energy Services segment and decreased net margin in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business, primarily due to lower natural gas volumes processed as a result of contract terminations in late 2006. Gain on sale of assets decreased primarily due to the $113.9 million gain on sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline recorded in the second quarter of 2006 in our ONEOK Partners segment. Equity earnings from investments decreased primarily due to the decrease in ONEOK Partners share of Northern Border Pipelines earnings from 70 percent in the first quarter of 2006 to 50 percent beginning in the second quarter of 2006. Allowance for equity funds used during construction and capital expenditures increased due to ONEOK Partners capital projects. Other income (expense) fluctuated primarily due to increased civic donations and expenses incurred by ONEOK Partners in 2006 related to costs associated with transitioning operations from Omaha, Nebraska. Interest expense increased primarily due to the additional borrowings by ONEOK Partners to complete the April 2006 transactions with us. The additional borrowings resulted in $21.3 million in higher interest expense in the first quarter of 2007. Increased interest expense was partially offset by lower interest expense on ONEOKs short term debt of $11.8 million during 2007, as a result of the proceeds from the sale of assets to ONEOK Partners, which reduced ONEOKs short term debt. 44 Table of Contents Minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries for 2007 and 2006 reflects the remaining 54.3 percent of ONEOK Partners that we did not own. For 2007, minority interest was lower due to the $113.9 million gain on sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline recorded in the second quarter of 2006 in our ONEOK Partners segment. Additionally, minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiaries for our ONEOK Partners segment for 2006 included the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline that ONEOK Partners did not own until April 2006. ONEOK Partners owned 100 percent of Guardian Pipeline beginning in April 2006, resulting in no minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries related to Guardian Pipeline after March 31, 2006. More information regarding our results of operations is provided in the following discussion of operating results for each of our segments. ONEOK Partners Selected Financial Results and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial results and operating information for our ONEOK Partners segment for the periods indicated.

Operating costs increased primarily due to incremental operating expenses associated with the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan, outside service costs primarily associated with scheduled maintenance expenses at ONEOK Partners Medford and Mont Belvieu fractionators, and chemical costs. Operating costs also increased due to costs associated with the startup of ONEOK Partners newly expanded Bushton fractionator and Overland Pass Pipeline. Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to depreciation expense associated with ONEOK Partners completed capital projects and the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan. Equity earnings from investments increased primarily due to higher gathering revenues in ONEOK Partners various investments, as well as a $8.3 million gain on the sale of Bison Pipeline LLC by Northern Border Pipeline, partially offset by reduced throughput on Northern Border Pipeline. ONEOK Partners owns a 50 percent equity interest in Northern Border Pipeline. Allowance for equity funds used during construction and capital expenditures increased due to ONEOK Partners capital projects. 2007 vs. 2006 Net margin increased primarily due to the following: an increase of $27.3 million from increased performance of ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids businesses, which benefited primarily from new supply connections that increased volumes gathered, transported, fractionated and sold; an increase of $20.6 million from new and renegotiated contractual terms and increased volumes in ONEOK Partners natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses; an increase of $13.5 million in higher NGL product price differentials and higher isomerization price differentials in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids gathering and fractionation business; an increase of $11.5 million in incremental net margin in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids pipeline business, due to the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan in October 2007; and an increase of $5.4 million in storage margins in ONEOK Partners natural gas pipelines business; partially offset by a decrease of $32.9 million in natural gas processing and transportation margins in ONEOK Partners natural gas businesses resulting primarily from lower throughput, higher fuel costs and lower volumes processed as a result of various contract terminations. Operating costs increased primarily due to higher employee related costs and the incremental operating expenses associated with the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan, partially offset by lower litigation costs. Depreciation and amortization decreased primarily due to a goodwill and asset impairment charge of $12.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2006 related to Black Mesa Pipeline. Gain on sale of assets decreased primarily due to the $113.9 million gain on the sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline recorded in the second quarter of 2006. 46 Table of Contents Equity earnings from investments primarily include earnings from ONEOK Partners interest in Northern Border Pipeline. The decrease for 2007 was primarily due to the decrease in ONEOK Partners share of Northern Border Pipelines earnings from 70 percent in the first quarter of 2006 to 50 percent beginning in the second quarter of 2006. See page 85 for discussion of the disposition of the 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline. Allowance for equity funds used during construction and capital expenditures increased due to ONEOK Partners capital projects. Minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased primarily due to our acquisition of the remaining interest in Guardian Pipeline. Minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiaries for our ONEOK Partners segment for 2006 included the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline that ONEOK Partners did not own until April 2006. ONEOK Partners owned 100 percent of Guardian Pipeline beginning in April 2006, resulting in no minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries related to Guardian Pipeline after March 31, 2006. Commodity Price Risk ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk, primarily from NGLs, as a result of its contractual obligations for services provided. A small percentage of its services, based on volume, is provided through keep whole arrangements. See discussion regarding ONEOK Partners commodity price risk beginning on page 63 under Commodity Price Risk in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Distribution Selected Financial Results The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for our Distribution segment for the periods indicated. Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Financial Results 2008 2007 2006 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Gas sales $ 2,049.0 $ 1,976.3 $ 1,836.9 $ 72.7 4 % $ 139.4 8 % Transportation revenues 87.3 87.3 88.3 0 % (1.0 ) (1 %) Cost of gas 1,496.7 1,435.4 1,358.4 61.3 4 % 77.0 6 % Net margin, excluding other 639.6 628.2 566.8 11.4 2 % 61.4 11 % Other revenues 41.3 35.4 33.0 5.9 17 % 2.4 7 % Net margin 680.9 663.6 599.8 17.3 3 % 63.8 11 % Operating costs 375.3 377.8 371.5 (2.5 ) (1 %) 6.3 2 % Depreciation and amortization 116.8 111.6 110.9 5.2 5 % 0.7 1 % Gain (loss) on sale of assets (0.1 ) 0.1 100 % (0.1 ) (100 %) Operating income $ 188.8 $ 174.1 $ 117.4 $ 14.7 8 % $ 56.7 48 % Capital expenditures $ 169.0 $ 162.0 $ 159.0 $ 7.0 4 % $ 3.0 2 % 2008 vs. 2007 Net margin increased primarily due to: an increase of $15.7 million resulting from the implementation of new rate mechanisms, which includes a $12.4 million increase in Oklahoma and a $3.3 million increase in Texas; and an increase of $2.2 million related to recovery of carrying costs for natural gas in storage. Operating costs decreased primarily due to: a decrease of $4.3 million in employee related costs; and a decrease of $1.0 million in bad debt expense; partially offset by an increase of $2.4 million in fuel related vehicle costs. Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to: an increase of $4.0 million in depreciation expense related to our investment in property, plant and equipment; and an increase of $1.2 million of regulatory amortization associated with revenue rider recoveries. 2007 vs. 2006 Net margin increased primarily due to: an increase of $55.2 million resulting from the implementation of new rate schedules, which includes $51.1 million in Kansas and $4.1 million in Texas; and an increase of $8.0 million from higher customer sales volumes as a result of a return to more normal weather in our entire service territory. 47 Table of Contents Operating costs increased primarily due to: an increase of $4.8 million in bad debt expense, primarily in Oklahoma; and an increase of $5.3 million due to higher property taxes in Kansas; partially offset by a decrease of $4.0 million in labor and employee benefit costs. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditure program includes expenditures for extending service to new areas, modifying customer service lines, increasing system capabilities, general replacements and improvements. It is our practice to maintain and upgrade facilities to ensure safe, reliable and efficient operations. Our capital expenditure program included $51.8 million, $50.6 million and $54.9 million for new business development in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Selected Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected operating information for our Distribution segment for the periods indicated.

Wholesale sales represent contracted gas volumes that exceed the needs of our residential, commercial and industrial customer base and are available for sale to other parties. Wholesale volumes decreased during 2008, compared with 2007 and 2006, due to reduced volumes available for sale. Public authority natural gas volumes reflect volumes used by state agencies and school districts served by Texas Gas Service. Transportation margins increased during 2008, compared with 2007, primarily due to increased transportation volumes in Oklahoma and Kansas. Regulatory Initiatives Oklahoma In August 2007, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed an application for authorization of a capital investment recovery mechanism. In February 2008, the OCC approved a joint stipulation, which allows Oklahoma Natural Gas to collect a rate of return, depreciation and 50 percent of the property tax expense associated with non revenue producing incremental capital investments since its 2005 rate case. The rates, which were effective in March 2008, generated margins of approximately $7.7 million in 2008. In July 2008, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed to increase the capital investment recovery mechanism from $7.6 million to $12.6 million annually. In October 2008, the parties signed a joint stipulation approving the request, and an administrative law judge of the OCC subsequently recommended approval of the joint stipulation. The final order was approved by the OCC in December 2008, and the increased recovery level was effective in January 2009. The OCC has authorized Oklahoma Natural Gas to defer transmission pipeline Integrity Management Program (IMP) costs incurred (inclusive of operations and maintenance expense, depreciation, property taxes and a rate of return) in compliance with the Federal Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. On January 31, 2007, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed the first application with the OCC seeking recovery of these costs. On August 31, 2007, the OCC issued an order approving a stipulation of the parties, which provided for recovery of $7.2 million in IMP deferrals incurred as of July 31, 2007, and these deferrals were recovered during the months of October 2007 through June 2008. The second IMP application was made at the OCC on January 31, 2008, and covered the IMP deferrals for the months of August through December 2007 and the true ups associated with the prior recovery period. This filing also requested $7.2 million to be recovered with a new IMP billing rate to be put in place in July 2008. The OCC approved this request, and billings under the 2008 IMP application began in July 2008. The third IMP application was made at the OCC on January 30, 2009, and covered the IMP deferrals for 2008, and the true ups associated with the prior recovery period. This filing requests a total of $10.8 million with a new IMP billing rate to be put in place in July 2009. Oklahoma Natural Gas will continue to defer IMP costs as they are incurred and will make future filings to recover those costs. In August 2008, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed with the OCC for approval to include the fuel related portion of bad debts in the Purchased Gas Adjustment mechanism for cost recovery. In October 2008, all parties signed the joint stipulation approving the request, and an administrative law judge of the OCC subsequently recommended approval of the joint stipulation. The joint stipulation allows Oklahoma Natural Gas to begin deferring its fuel related bad debts beginning in January 2009 and to collect those amounts above the levels in base rates through the Purchased Gas Adjustment beginning in January 2010. The final order was issued by the OCC in December 2008. The associated deferrals began in January 2009. In October 2008, a joint application for incentive based rates was filed by the OCC staff and Oklahoma Natural Gas. This application proposes that the OCC adopt an incentive based rate design and more streamlined regulatory process. If approved, this will provide for more timely rate changes. Kansas In October 2006, Kansas Gas Service reached a settlement with the KCC staff and all other parties to increase annual revenues by approximately $52 million. The terms of the settlement were approved by the KCC in November 2006. The rate increase is effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2007. In August 2008, Kansas Gas Service filed an application with the KCC to impose a surcharge designed to annually collect approximately $2.9 million in costs associated with its Gas System Reliability Surcharge (GSRS) mechanism. The GSRS mechanism allows natural gas utilities to earn a return and recover carrying costs associated with investments made to comply with state and federal pipeline safety requirements or costs to relocate existing facilities pursuant to requests made by a government entity. The KCC approved the request in December 2008, with authorized GSRS collections effective with customer billings on January 1, 2009. 49 Table of Contents Texas Texas Gas Service has received several regulatory approvals to implement rate increases in various municipalities in Texas. A total of $1.7 million in annual rate increases were approved and implemented in 2007. A total of $5.5 million in annual rate increases were approved and implemented in 2006. In August 2007, Texas Gas Service filed for a rate adjustment with the city of El Paso, Texas, and the municipalities of Anthony, Clint, Horizon City, Socorro and Vinton. Texas Gas Service requested a total annual increase of $5.5 million. In February 2008, the El Paso City Council approved an annual rate increase of approximately $3.1 million. The increase was effective in February 2008. In April 2008, the RRC approved a rate increase in our South Texas jurisdiction. The rate increase was effective May 2008 and will increase revenues by $1.1 million annually. In May 2008, Texas Gas Service filed for interim rate relief under the Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program with the city of El Paso, Texas, and surrounding communities for approximately $1.1 million. This program is a capital recovery mechanism that allows for an interim rate adjustment providing recovery and a return on incremental capital investments made between rate cases. In August 2008, an annual rate increase of approximately $1.0 million was approved; the new rates were effective in September 2008. In February 2009, Texas Gas Service filed a statement of intent to increase rates in its central Texas service area for approximately $3.6 million. If approved, new rates are expected to become effective in June 2009. General Certain costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process have been recorded as regulatory assets in accordance with Statement 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Should recovery cease due to regulatory actions, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria of Statement 71, and accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. Energy Services Selected Financial Results The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for our Energy Services segment for the periods indicated. Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Financial Results 2008 2007 2006 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Revenues $ 7,585.8 $ 6,629.4 $ 6,335.8 $ 956.4 14 % $ 293.6 5 % Cost of sales and fuel 7,475.1 6,382.0 6,062.0 1,093.1 17 % 320.0 5 % Net margin 110.7 247.4 273.8 (136.7 ) (55 %) (26.4 ) (10 %) Operating costs 35.6 39.9 42.5 (4.3 ) (11 %) (2.6 ) (6 %) Depreciation and amortization 0.9 2.1 2.1 (1.2 ) (57 %) 0 % Gain on sale of assets 1.5 1.5 100 % 0 % Operating income $ 75.7 $ 205.4 $ 229.2 $ (129.7 ) (63 %) $ (23.8 ) (10 %) Capital expenditures $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ $ (0.1 ) (50 %) $ 0.2 100 % Energy markets were affected by higher commodity prices during 2008, compared with 2007. The increase in commodity prices had a direct impact on our revenues and the cost of sales and fuel. 2008 vs. 2007 Net margin decreased primarily due to the following: a net decrease of $40.3 million in transportation margins, net of hedging activities, primarily due to decreased basis differentials between the Rocky Mountain and Mid Continent regions, and increased transportation related costs in 2008; a decrease of $13.9 million in financial trading margins; and a net decrease of $83.3 million in storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, primarily due to: o a net decrease of $87.3 million in physical storage margins net of hedging activities, as a result of: hedging opportunities associated with weather related events that led to higher storage margins in 2007 compared with 2008; 50 Table of Contents lower 2008 storage margins related to storage risk management positions and the impact of changes in natural gas prices on these positions; and fewer opportunities to optimize storage capacity due to the significant decline in natural gas prices in the second half of 2008; o a decrease of $9.7 million in physical storage margins due to a lower of cost or market write down on natural gas inventory; and o a decrease of $2.1 million due to colder than anticipated weather and market conditions that increased the supply cost of managing our peaking and load following services and provided fewer opportunities to increase margins through optimization activities, primarily in the first quarter of 2008; partially offset by o an increase of $15.8 million from changes in the unrealized fair value of derivative instruments associated with storage and marketing activities and improved marketing margins, which benefited from price movements and optimization activities. Operating costs decreased primarily due to lower employee related costs and depreciation expense. 2007 vs. 2006 Net margin decreased primarily due to: a decrease of $22.0 million in transportation margins, net of hedging activities, associated with changes in the unrealized fair value of derivative instruments and the impact of a force majeure event on the Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline, as more fully described below; a decrease of $5.0 million in retail activities from lower physical margins due to market conditions and increased competition; a decrease of $4.3 million in financial trading margins that was partially offset by an increase of $4.9 million in storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, related to: o an increase in physical storage margins, net of hedging activity, due to higher realized seasonal storage spreads and optimization activities; partially offset by o a decrease in marketing margins; and o a net increase in the cost associated with managing our peaking and load following services, slightly offset by higher demand fees collected for these services. In September 2007, a portion of the volume contracted under our firm transportation agreement with Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline Company was curtailed due to a fire at a Cheyenne Plains pipeline compressor station. The fire damaged a significant amount of instrumentation and electrical wiring, causing Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline Company to declare a force majeure event on the pipeline. This firm commitment was hedged in accordance with Statement 133. The discontinuance of fair value hedge accounting on the portion of the firm commitment that was impacted by the force majeure event resulted in a loss of approximately $5.5 million that was recognized in the third quarter of 2007, of which $2.4 million of insurance proceeds were recovered and recognized in the first quarter of 2008. Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline Company resumed full operations in November 2007. Operating costs decreased primarily due to decreased legal and employee related costs, and reduced ad valorem tax expense. Selected Operating Information The following table sets forth certain selected operating information for our Energy Services segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2008 2007 2006 Natural gas marketed (Bcf) 1,160 1,191 1,132 Natural gas gross margin ($/Mcf) $ 0.07 $ 0.19 $ 0.22 Physically settled volumes (Bcf) 2,359 2,370 2,288 Our natural gas in storage at December 31, 2008, was 81.9 Bcf, compared with 66.7 Bcf at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, our total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 91 Bcf, compared with 96 Bcf at December 31, 2007. Natural gas volumes marketed decreased slightly during 2008, compared with 2007, due to increased injections in the third quarter of 2008. In addition, demand for natural gas was impacted by weather related events in the third quarter of 2008, including a 15 percent decrease in cooling degree days and demand disruption caused by Hurricane Ike. 51 Table of Contents Natural gas volumes marketed increased during 2007, compared with 2006, due to an increase in sales activity in the southeastern United States in the third quarter of 2007. Natural gas volumes were also impacted by a 14 percent increase in heating degree days in our service territory, compared with the same period in 2006. The acquisition of natural gas storage capacity is more competitive as a result of new market entrants. The increased demand for storage capacity has resulted in an increase in both the cost of leasing storage capacity and the required term of the lease. Longer terms and increased costs for storage capacity leases could result in significant increases in the cost of our contractual commitments. The following table shows our margins by activity for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Marketing, storage and transportation, gross $ 313.4 $ 409.1 $ 414.9 Less: Storage and transportation costs (219.8 ) (191.9 ) (180.7 ) Marketing, storage and transportation, net 93.6 217.2 234.2 Retail marketing 14.8 14.0 19.0 Financial trading 2.3 16.2 20.6 Net margin $ 110.7 $ 247.4 $ 273.8 Marketing, storage and transportation, net, primarily includes physical marketing, purchases and sales, firm storage and transportation capacity expense, including the impact of cash flow and fair value hedges, and other derivative instruments used to manage our risk associated with these activities. Risk management and operational decisions have a significant impact on the net result of our marketing and storage activities. Origination gains are also a component of marketing activity, which is the fair value recognition of contracts that our wholesale marketing department structures to meet the risk management needs of our customers. Retail marketing includes revenues from providing physical marketing and supply services, coupled with risk management services, to residential, municipal, and small commercial and industrial customers. Financial trading margin includes activities that are generally executed using financially settled derivatives. These activities are normally short term in nature, with a focus on capturing short term price volatility. Revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income include financial trading margins, as well as certain physical natural gas transactions with our trading counterparties. Revenues and cost of sales and fuel from such physical transactions are required to be reported on a net basis. Contingencies Legal Proceedings We are a party to various litigation matters and claims that are normal in the course of our operations. While the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. FERC Matter As a result of a transaction that was brought to the attention of one of our affiliates by a third party, we conducted an internal review of transactions that may have violated FERC natural gas capacity release rules or related rules and determined that there were transactions that should be disclosed to the FERC. We notified the FERC of this review and filed a report with the FERC regarding these transactions in March 2008. We cooperated fully with the FERC in its investigation of this matter and have taken steps to better ensure that current and future transactions comply with applicable FERC regulations by implementing a compliance plan dealing with capacity release. We entered into a global settlement with the FERC to resolve this matter and other FERC enforcement matters, which was approved by the FERC on January 15, 2009. The global settlement provides for a total civil penalty of $4.5 million and approximately $2.2 million in disgorgement of profits and interest, of which $1.7 million of the civil penalty was allocated to ONEOK Partners. The amounts were recorded as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008. We made the required payments in January 2009. 52 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES General Part of our strategy is to grow through acquisitions and internally generated growth projects that strengthen and complement our existing assets. We have relied primarily on operating cash flow, borrowings from commercial paper and credit agreements, and issuance of debt and equity in the capital markets for our liquidity and capital resource requirements. We expect to continue to use these sources for liquidity and capital resource needs on both a short and long term basis. We have no material guarantees of debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated parties. During 2008 and continuing into 2009, the capital markets experienced volatility and disruption, which could limit our access to those markets or increase the cost of issuing new securities in the future. Higher commodity prices and wider basis differentials, particularly in 2008, have also resulted in higher collateral requirements and natural gas inventory costs in our Energy Services segment. Throughout this period, ONEOK has continued to have access to its $1.2 billion revolving credit agreement (ONEOK Credit Agreement); also, ONEOK Partners has continued to have access to the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, which has been adequate to fund short term liquidity needs. In addition, beginning in August 2008, ONEOK had access to its new short term credit agreement. In the third quarter of 2008, ONEOK began to utilize both of its credit agreements and lessened its use of commercial paper due to decreased liquidity and rising costs in the commercial paper market. See discussion below under Short term Liquidity. Also in 2008, ONEOK Partners issued common units and received additional contributions from ONEOK Partners GP. See discussion below under Long term Financing. We expect continued deteriorating economic conditions in 2009, with downward pressures, relative to 2008, on commodity prices. We also expect continued volatility and disruption in the financial markets, which could result in an increased cost of capital. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners ability to continue to access capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on the Companys and Partnerships respective financial condition, credit ratings and market conditions. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners anticipate that cash flow generated from operations, existing capital resources and ability to obtain financing will enable both to maintain current levels of operations and planned operations, collateral requirements and capital expenditures. Capitalization Structure The following table sets forth our capitalization structure for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Long term debt 67% 70% Equity 33% 30% Debt (including notes payable) 76% 71% Equity 24% 29% ONEOK does not guarantee the debt of ONEOK Partners. For purposes of determining compliance with financial covenants in the ONEOK Credit Agreement and ONEOKs $400 million 364 day revolving credit facility dated August 6, 2008 (the 364 Day Facility), the debt of ONEOK Partners is excluded. At December 31, 2008, ONEOKs capitalization structure, excluding the debt of ONEOK Partners, was 44 percent long term debt and 56 percent equity, compared with 51 percent long term debt and 49 percent equity at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, ONEOKs capitalization structure, including notes payable and excluding the debt of ONEOK Partners, was 59 percent debt and 41 percent equity, compared with 52 percent debt and 48 percent equity at December 31, 2007. In February 2008, ONEOK repaid $402.3 million of maturing long term debt with cash from operations and short term borrowings. In February 2009, ONEOK repaid $100 million of maturing long term debt with cash from operations and short term borrowings. Cash Management ONEOK and ONEOK Partners each use similar centralized cash management programs that concentrate the cash assets of their operating subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing, transaction costs and bank fees. Both centralized cash management programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of the operating subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the respective consolidated groups. ONEOK Partners operating subsidiaries participate in these programs to the extent they are permitted under FERC regulations. Under these cash management programs, depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short term cash surpluses or cash requirements, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners provide cash to their subsidiary or the subsidiary provides cash to them. 53 Table of Contents Short term Liquidity ONEOKs principal sources of short term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities, quarterly distributions from ONEOK Partners, the ONEOK Credit Agreement and the 364 Day Facility, as discussed below. ONEOK also has a commercial paper program that can be utilized for short term liquidity needs, to the extent funds are available under the ONEOK Credit Agreement and the 364 Day Facility. ONEOK Partners principal sources of short term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities and the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. During late 2008, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners decided to borrow under their available credit facilities to fund their respective anticipated working capital requirements for the remainder of 2008 and into 2009. In August 2008, ONEOK entered into the 364 Day Facility. The interest rate is based, at ONEOKs election, on either (i) the higher of prime or one half of one percent above the Federal Funds Rate or (ii) the Eurodollar rate plus a set number of basis points based on ONEOKs current long term unsecured debt ratings by Moodys and S&P. The 364 Day Facility is being used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. In September 2008, ONEOK entered into an amendment to the ONEOK Credit Agreement. The amendment changed certain sublimits but did not change the lenders aggregate commitment to lend up to $1.2 billion under the ONEOK Credit Agreement. The total amount of short term borrowings authorized by ONEOKs Board of Directors is $2.5 billion. At December 31, 2008, ONEOK had no commercial paper outstanding, $1.4 billion in borrowings outstanding, $64.9 million in letters of credit issued, which includes $64.6 million under the ONEOK Credit Agreement and an additional $0.3 million in other letters of credit, and available cash and cash equivalents of approximately $332.4 million. Considering outstanding borrowings, commercial paper and letters of credit under the ONEOK Credit Agreement, ONEOK had $135.4 million of credit available at December 31, 2008, under the ONEOK Credit Agreement and the 364 Day Facility. As of December 31, 2008, ONEOK could have issued $1.5 billion of additional short and long term debt under the most restrictive provisions contained in its various borrowing agreements. The total amount of short term borrowings authorized by the Board of Directors of ONEOK Partners GP, the general partner of ONEOK Partners, is $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2008, ONEOK Partners had $870 million in borrowings outstanding and $130 million of credit available under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and available cash and cash equivalents of approximately $177.6 million. As of December 31, 2008, ONEOK Partners could have issued a $772.6 million of additional short and long term debt under the most restrictive provisions of its agreements. ONEOK Partners has an outstanding $25 million letter of credit issued by Royal Bank of Canada, which is used for counterparty credit support. ONEOK Partners also has a $15 million Senior Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility and Reimbursement Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., of which $12 million is currently being used, and an agreement with Royal Bank of Canada, pursuant to which a $12 million letter of credit was issued. Both agreements are used to support various permits required by the KDHE for ONEOK Partners ongoing business in Kansas. The ONEOK Credit Agreement and the 364 Day Facility contain certain financial, operational and legal covenants. These requirements include, among others: a $400 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit; a limitation on ONEOKs stand alone debt to capital ratio, which may not exceed 67.5 percent at the end of any calendar quarter; a requirement that ONEOK maintains the power to control the management and policies of ONEOK Partners, a limit on new investments in master limited partnerships; and other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants relating to liens, investments, fundamental changes in ONEOKs businesses, changes in the nature of ONEOKs businesses, transactions with affiliates, the use of proceeds and a covenant that prevents ONEOK from restricting its subsidiaries ability to pay dividends. The debt covenant calculations in the ONEOK Credit Agreement and the 364 Day Facility exclude the debt of ONEOK Partners. Upon breach of any covenant by ONEOK, amounts outstanding under the ONEOK Credit Agreement or the 364 Day Facility may become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2008, ONEOKs stand alone debt to capital ratio was 58.2 percent, and ONEOK was in compliance with all covenants under the ONEOK Credit Agreement and the ONEOK 364 Day Facility. 54 Table of Contents Under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, ONEOK Partners is required to comply with certain financial, operational and legal covenants. Among other things, these requirements include maintaining a ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA plus minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries, distributions received from investments and EBITDA related to any approved capital projects less equity earnings from investments and the equity portion of AFUDC) of no more than 5 to 1. If ONEOK Partners consummates one or more acquisitions in which the aggregate purchase price is $25 million or more, the allowable ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA will be increased to 5.5 to 1 for the three calendar quarters following the acquisition. Upon any breach of any covenant by ONEOK Partners in its ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2008, ONEOK Partners ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA was 4.1 to 1, and ONEOK Partners was in compliance with all covenants under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. The average interest rate on ONEOK and ONEOK Partners short term debt outstanding at December 31, 2008, was 4.51 percent and 4.22 percent, respectively, compared with a weighted average rate of 3.88 percent and 3.94 percent, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2008. Based on the forward LIBOR curve, we expect the interest rate on ONEOK and ONEOK Partners short term borrowings to decrease in 2009, compared with 2008. Long term Financing In addition to the principal sources of short term liquidity discussed above, options available to ONEOK to meet its longer term cash requirements include the issuance of equity, issuance of long term notes, issuance of convertible debt securities, asset securitization and sale/leaseback of facilities. Options available to ONEOK Partners to meet its longer term cash requirements include the issuance of common units, issuance of long term notes, issuance of convertible debt securities, and asset securitization and sale/leaseback of facilities. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners are subject, however, to changes in the equity and debt markets, and there is no assurance they will be able or willing to access the public or private markets in the future. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners may choose to meet their cash requirements by utilizing some combination of cash flows from operations, altering the timing of controllable expenditures, restricting future acquisitions and capital projects, borrowing under existing credit facilities or pursuing other debt or equity financing alternatives. Some of these alternatives could involve higher costs or negatively affect their respective credit ratings. Based on ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners investment grade credit ratings, general financial condition and market expectations regarding their future earnings and projected cash flows, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners believe that they will be able to meet their respective cash requirements and maintain their investment grade credit ratings. ONEOK Partners Debt Issuance In September 2007, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 6.85 percent Senior Notes due 2037 (the 2037 Notes). The 2037 Notes were issued under ONEOK Partners existing shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. ONEOK Partners may redeem the 2037 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2037 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make whole premium. The redemption price will never be less than 100 percent of the principal amount of the 2037 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2037 Notes are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with all of ONEOK Partners existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, and effectively junior to all of the existing debt and other liabilities of its non guarantor subsidiaries. The 2037 Notes are non recourse to ONEOK. Debt Covenants The terms of ONEOKs long term notes are governed by indentures containing covenants that include, among other provisions, limitations on ONEOKs ability to place liens on its property or assets and its ability to sell and lease back its property. We filed a new form of indenture in 2008. The new indenture includes covenants that are similar to those contained in our prior indentures. The new indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of debt securities that may be issued and provides that debt securities may be issued from time to time in one or more additional series. The indenture governing ONEOK Partners 2037 Notes does not limit the aggregate principal amount of debt securities that may be issued and provides that debt securities may be issued from time to time in one or more additional series. The indenture contains covenants including, among other provisions, limitations on ONEOK Partners ability to place liens on its property or assets and its ability to sell and lease back its property. ONEOK Partners $250 million and $225 million senior notes, due 2010 and 2011, respectively, contain provisions that require ONEOK Partners to offer to repurchase the senior notes at par value if its Moodys or S&P credit rating falls below investment grade (Baa3 for Moodys or BBB for S&P) and the investment grade rating is not reinstated within a period of 40 days. Further, the indentures governing ONEOK Partners senior notes due 2010 and 2011 include an event of default 55 Table of Contents upon acceleration of other indebtedness of $25 million or more and the indentures governing the senior notes due 2012, 2016, 2036 and 2037 include an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of $100 million or more that would be triggered by such an offer to repurchase. Such an event of default would entitle the trustee or the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior notes due 2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2036 and 2037 to declare those notes immediately due and payable in full. ONEOK Partners Equity Issuance In March 2008, ONEOK purchased from ONEOK Partners, in a private placement, an additional 5.4 million of ONEOK Partners common units for a total purchase price of approximately $303.2 million. In addition, ONEOK Partners completed a public offering of 2.5 million common units at $58.10 per common unit and received net proceeds of $140.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts but before offering expenses. In conjunction with ONEOK Partners private placement and the public offering of common units, ONEOK Partners GP contributed $9.4 million to ONEOK Partners in order to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners GP funded these amounts with available cash and short term borrowings. In April 2008, ONEOK Partners sold an additional 128,873 common units at $58.10 per common unit to the underwriters of the public offering upon the partial exercise of their option to purchase additional common units to cover over allotments. ONEOK Partners received net proceeds of approximately $7.2 million from the sale of these common units after deducting underwriting discounts but before offering expenses. In conjunction with the partial exercise by the underwriters, ONEOK Partners GP contributed $0.2 million to ONEOK Partners in order to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest. Following these transactions, our interest in ONEOK Partners is 47.7 percent. ONEOK Partners used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of common units and the general partner contributions to repay borrowings under its existing ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. Capital Expenditures ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners capital expenditures are typically financed through operating cash flows, short and long term debt and the issuance of equity. Total capital expenditures for 2008 were $1,473.1 million, compared with $883.7 million in 2007, exclusive of acquisitions. Of these amounts, ONEOK Partners capital expenditures for 2008 were $1,253.9 million, compared with $709.9 million in 2007, exclusive of acquisitions. The increase in capital expenditures for 2008, compared with 2007, is driven primarily by ONEOK Partners internal capital projects discussed beginning on page 37, and ONEOKs purchase of ONEOK Plaza. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners expect to continue to finance future capital expenditures with a combination of operating cash flows, short and long term debt, and the issuance of common units by ONEOK Partners. The following table summarizes our 2009 projected capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC. 2009 Projected Capital Expenditures (Millions of dollars) ONEOK Partners $ 425 Distribution 137 Energy Services Other 19 Total projected capital expenditures $ 581 Projected 2009 capital expenditures are significantly less than 2008 capital expenditures, primarily due to the completion of the Overland Pass Pipeline and related projects and the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension. Additional information about our capital expenditures is included under Capital Projects on page 37. ONEOK Partners anticipates spending $300 million to $500 million per year on growth capital expenditures for the years 2010 through 2015. Investment in Northern Border Pipeline Northern Border Pipeline anticipates an equity contribution of approximately $85 million that will be required of its partners in 2009, of which ONEOK Partners share will be approximately $43 million for its 50 percent equity interest. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2008, are shown in the table below. ONEOK ONEOK Partners Rating Agency Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Moodys Baa2 Stable Baa2 Stable S&P BBB Stable BBB Stable 56 Table of Contents ONEOKs commercial paper is rated P2 by Moodys and A2 by S&P. ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners credit ratings, which are currently investment grade, may be affected by a material change in financial ratios or a material event affecting the business. The most common criteria for assessment of credit ratings are the debt to capital ratio, business risk profile, pretax and after tax interest coverage, and liquidity. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners do not anticipate their respective credit ratings to be downgraded. However, if our credit ratings were downgraded, the interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings, the ONEOK Credit Agreement and the 364 Day Facility would increase, resulting in an increase in our cost to borrow funds, and we could potentially lose access to the commercial paper market. Likewise, ONEOK Partners would see increased borrowing costs under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. In the event that ONEOK is unable to borrow funds under its commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in its business, ONEOK would continue to have access to the ONEOK Credit Agreement, which expires in July 2011, and the 364 Day Facility, which expires in August 2009. An adverse rating change alone is not a default under the ONEOK Credit Agreement, the 364 Day Facility or the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement but could trigger repurchase obligations with respect to certain long term debt. See additional discussion about our credit ratings under Debt Covenants. If ONEOK Partners repurchase obligations are triggered, it may not have sufficient cash on hand to repurchase and repay any accelerated senior notes, which may cause it to borrow money under its credit facilities or seek alternative financing sources to finance the repurchases and repayment. ONEOK Partners could also face difficulties accessing capital or its borrowing costs could increase, impacting its ability to obtain financing for acquisitions or capital expenditures, to refinance indebtedness and to fulfill its debt obligations. Our Energy Services segment relies upon the investment grade rating of ONEOKs senior unsecured long term debt to reduce its collateral requirements. If ONEOKs credit ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to participate in energy marketing and trading activities could be significantly limited. Without an investment grade rating, we may be required to fund margin requirements with our counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments. At December 31, 2008, we could have been required to fund approximately $36.2 million in margin requirements related to financial contracts upon such a downgrade. A decline in ONEOKs credit rating below investment grade may also significantly impact other business segments. Other than ONEOK Partners note repurchase obligations and the margin requirements for our Energy Services segment described above, we have determined that we do not have significant exposure to rating triggers under ONEOKs trust indentures, building leases, equipment leases and other various contracts. Rating triggers are defined as provisions that would create an automatic default or acceleration of indebtedness based on a change in our credit rating. In the normal course of business, ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners counterparties provide secured and unsecured credit. In the event of a downgrade in ONEOKs or ONEOK Partners credit rating or a significant change in ONEOKs or ONEOK Partners counterparties evaluation of our creditworthiness, ONEOK or ONEOK Partners could be asked to provide additional collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments. ONEOK Partners Class B Units The units we received from ONEOK Partners were newly created Class B limited partner units. Distributions on the Class B limited partner units were prorated from the date of issuance. As of April 7, 2007, the Class B limited partner units are no longer subordinated to distributions on ONEOK Partners common units and generally have the same voting rights as the common units. At a special meeting of the ONEOK Partners common unitholders held March 29, 2007, the unitholders approved a proposal to permit the conversion of all or a portion of the Class B limited partner units issued in the acquisition and consolidation of certain companies comprising our former gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage segments in a series of transactions (collectively the ONEOK Transactions) into common units at the option of the Class B unitholder. The March 29, 2007, special meeting was adjourned to May 10, 2007, to allow unitholders additional time to vote on a proposal to approve amendments to the ONEOK Partners Partnership Agreement, which had the amendments been approved, would have granted voting rights for units held by us and our affiliates if a vote is held to remove us as the general partner and would have required fair market value compensation for our general partner interest if we are removed as general partner. While a majority of ONEOK Partners common unitholders voted in favor of the proposed amendments to the ONEOK Partners Partnership Agreement at the reconvened meeting of the common unitholders held May 10, 2007, the proposed amendments were not approved by the required two thirds affirmative vote of the outstanding units, excluding the common units and Class B units held by us and our affiliates. As a result, effective April 7, 2007, the Class B limited partner units are entitled to receive increased quarterly distributions and distributions upon liquidation equal to 110 percent of the distributions paid with respect to the common units. On June 21, 2007, we, as the sole holder of ONEOK Partners Class B limited partner units, waived our right to receive the increased quarterly distributions on the Class B units for the period April 7, 2007, through December 31, 2007, and 57 Table of Contents continuing thereafter until we give ONEOK Partners no less than 90 days advance notice that we have withdrawn our waiver. Any such withdrawal of the waiver will be effective with respect to any distribution on the Class B units declared or paid on or after 90 days following delivery of the notice. In addition, since the proposed amendments to the ONEOK Partners Partnership Agreement were not approved by the common unitholders, if the common unitholders vote at any time to remove us or our affiliates as the general partner, quarterly distributions payable on Class B limited partner units would increase to 123.5 percent of the distributions payable with respect to the common units, and distributions payable upon liquidation of the Class B limited partner units would increase to 123.5 percent of the distributions payable with respect to the common units. Stock Repurchase Plan For more information regarding the Stock Repurchase Plan, refer to discussion in Note G of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price volatility. Significant fluctuations in commodity price in either physical or financial energy contracts may impact our overall liquidity due to the impact the commodity price changes have on our cash flows from operating activities, including the impact on working capital for NGLs and natural gas held in storage, margin requirements and certain energy related receivables. We believe that ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners available credit and cash and cash equivalents are adequate to meet liquidity requirements associated with commodity price volatility. See discussion beginning on page 63 under Commodity Price Risk in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for information on our hedging activities. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans Information about our pension and postretirement benefits plans, including anticipated contributions, is included under Note J of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. At December 31, 2007, the funded status of our pension plans exceeded 94 percent as required by federal regulations. General market factors in 2008 negatively impacted the fair value of our plan assets, and as a result, we made a voluntary contribution to our pension plans of $112 million on December 31, 2008. We do not expect that our funding requirements in 2009 will have a material impact on our liquidity. ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES Information about our environmental liabilities is included in Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS We use the indirect method to prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period. These reconciling items include depreciation and amortization, allowance for equity funds used during construction, gain on sale of assets, minority interests in income of consolidated affiliates, undistributed earnings from equity investments in excess of distributions received, deferred income taxes, stock based compensation expense, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory adjustments and investment securities gains. The following table sets forth the changes in cash flows by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated. Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 2008 2007 2006 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 475.7 $ 1,029.7 $ 873.3 $ (554.0 ) (54 %) $ 156.4 18 % Investing activities (1,454.3 ) (1,151.8 ) (237.2 ) (302.5 ) (26 %) (914.6 ) * Financing activities 1,469.6 72.9 (618.8 ) 1,396.7 * 691.7 * Change in cash and cash equivalents 491.0 (49.2 ) 17.3 540.2 * (66.5 ) * Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 19.1 68.3 7.9 (49.2 ) (72 %) 60.4 * Effect of Accounting Change on Cash and Cash Equivalents 43.1 0 % (43.1 ) (100 %) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 510.1 $ 19.1 $ 68.3 $ 491.0 * $ (49.2 ) (72 %) * Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 58 Table of Contents Operating Cash Flows Operating cash flows decreased by $554.0 million for 2008, compared with 2007, primarily due to changes in working capital. These changes decreased operating cash flows by $515.3 million for 2008, compared with an increase of $203.6 million for 2007, primarily due to decreases in accounts payable and increased funding for our pension plans, partially offset by decreases in accounts and notes receivable. The decrease in operating cash flows due to increases in working capital for 2008 was partially offset by higher net income. Operating cash flows increased by $156.4 million for 2007, compared with 2006. Working capital increased operating cash flows by $203.6 million for 2007, compared with an increase of $59.7 million for 2006. Investing Cash Flows The increased use of cash during 2008 was primarily related to a $589.4 million increase in capital expenditures, compared with 2007. Capital expenditures increased $507.4 for 2007, compared with 2006. These increases are primarily related to ONEOK Partners capital projects. In October 2007, ONEOK Partners acquired an interstate natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products pipeline system and related assets from a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan for approximately $300 million, before working capital adjustments. In April 2006, our ONEOK Partners segment received $297.0 million for the sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline. Our Energy Services segment received $53.0 million for the sale of our discontinued component, Spring Creek, in October 2006. Acquisitions in 2006 primarily relate to our ONEOK Partners segment acquiring the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline not previously owned by ONEOK Partners for approximately $77 million. We also purchased from TransCanada its 17.5 percent general partner interest in ONEOK Partners for $40 million. Additionally, ONEOK Partners paid $11.6 million to Williams for a 99 percent interest in, and initial capital expenditures related to, the Overland Pass Pipeline Company natural gas liquids pipeline joint venture. We had a decrease in short term investments of $31.1 million for 2007, compared with a total investment of $31.1 million for 2006. During 2007, we had less cash to invest following our repurchase of 7.5 million shares of our outstanding common stock in June. Investing cash flows for 2006 also include the impact of the deconsolidation of Northern Border Pipeline and consolidation of Guardian Pipeline. Financing Cash Flows Net short term borrowings were $2.1 billion for 2008, compared with $196.6 million for 2007. The increased short term borrowings during 2008 were used to repay a portion of $402.3 million of maturing long term debt. Short term borrowings also increased as the result ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners decision in late 2008 to borrow under their available credit facilities to fund their respective anticipated working capital requirements for the remainder of 2008 and into 2009, and ONEOK Partners capital projects. During 2008, ONEOK Partners public sale of 2.6 million common units generated approximately $147 million, after deducting underwriting discounts but before offering expenses. In 2007, short term financing was primarily used to fund ONEOK Partners capital projects. ONEOK Partners $598 million debt issuance, net of discounts, was used to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit agreement and finance the $300 million acquisition of assets, before working capital adjustments, from a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan in October 2007. In 2006, we repaid the remaining $900 million outstanding on our $1.0 billion short term bridge financing agreement. During the second quarter of 2006, ONEOK Partners borrowed $1.05 billion under its $1.1 billion 364 day credit facility dated April 6, 2006, (Bridge Facility) to finance a portion of the acquisition of the ONEOK Energy Assets and $77 million under its then existing credit agreement to acquire the 66 2/3 percent interest in Guardian Pipeline not previously owned by ONEOK Partners. During the third quarter of 2006, ONEOK Partners completed the underwritten public offering of senior notes totaling $1.4 billion in net proceeds, before offering expenses, which were used to repay all of the amounts outstanding of the $1.05 billion borrowed under the ONEOK Partners Bridge Facility and to repay $335 million of indebtedness outstanding under its then existing credit agreement. On February 16, 2006, we successfully settled our 16.1 million equity units to 19.5 million shares of our common stock. With the settlement of the equity units, we received $402.4 million in cash, which we used to repay a portion of our commercial paper. We repaid a total of $641.5 million of our commercial paper during 2006. See Note G of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional discussion regarding the equity unit conversion. 59 Table of Contents In March 2006, our ONEOK Partners segment borrowed $33 million under its then existing credit agreement to redeem all of the outstanding Viking Gas Transmission Series A, B, C and D senior notes and paid a redemption premium of $3.6 million. During 2007, we paid $20.1 million for the settlement of the forward purchase contract related to our stock repurchase in February and approximately $370 million for our stock repurchase in June. We paid $281.4 million to repurchase shares in August 2006.

Interest Payments on Debt Interest expense is calculated by multiplying long term debt by the respective coupon rates, adjusted for active swaps. Operating Leases Our operating leases include a natural gas processing plant, storage contracts, office space, pipeline equipment, rights of way and vehicles. Operating lease obligations for ONEOK exclude intercompany payments related to the lease of a gas processing plant. Firm Transportation Contracts Our ONEOK Partners, Distribution and Energy Services segments are party to fixed price transportation contracts. However, the costs associated with our Distribution segments contracts are recovered through rates as allowed by the applicable regulatory agency and are excluded from the table above. Firm transportation agreements with our ONEOK Partners segments natural gas gathering and processing joint ventures require minimum monthly payments. Financial and Physical Derivatives These are obligations arising from our ONEOK Partners and Energy Services segments physical and financial derivatives for fixed price purchase commitments and are based on market information at December 31, 2008. Not included in these amounts are offsetting cash inflows from our Energy Services segments product sales and net positive settlements. As market information changes daily and is potentially volatile, these values may change significantly. Additionally, product sales may require additional purchase obligations to fulfill sales obligations that are not reflected in these amounts. 60 Table of Contents Employee Benefit Plans Employee benefit plans include our minimum required contribution to our pension and postretirement benefit plans for 2009. See Note J of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for discussion of our employee benefit plans. Purchase Commitments Purchase commitments include commitments related to ONEOK Partners growth capital expenditures and other rights of way commitments. Purchase commitments exclude commodity purchase contracts, which are included in the Financial and physical derivatives amounts.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Policy and Oversight We control the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibilities for our risk management limits and policies. Our risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price and credit risk management, and marketing and trading activities. The committee also monitors risk metrics including value at risk (VAR) and mark to market losses. We have a risk control group that is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies and procedures and monitoring certain risk metrics. Key risk control activities include risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics. Our exposure to market risk discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity prices. Our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in interest rates or commodity prices and the timing of transactions. COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to commodity price risk and the impact of market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices. Commodity price risk refers to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in commodity energy prices. To minimize the risk from market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, we use commodity derivative instruments such as futures, physical forward contracts, swaps and options to manage commodity price risk associated with existing or anticipated purchase and sale agreements, existing physical natural gas in storage, and basis risk. ONEOK Partners ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk, primarily with respect to NGLs, as a result of receiving commodities in exchange for its gathering and processing services. To a lesser extent, ONEOK Partners is exposed to the relative price differential between NGLs and natural gas, or the gross processing spread, with respect to its keep whole processing contracts. ONEOK Partners is also exposed to the risk of price fluctuations and the cost of intervening transportation at various market locations. As part of ONEOK Partners hedging strategy, ONEOK Partners uses commodity fixed price physical forwards and derivative contracts, including NYMEX based futures and over the counter swaps, to minimize earnings volatility in its natural gas gathering and processing business related to natural gas, NGL and condensate price fluctuations. ONEOK Partners reduces its gross processing spread exposure through a combination of physical and financial hedges. ONEOK Partners utilizes a portion of its percent of proceeds equity natural gas as an offset, or natural hedge, to an equivalent portion of its keep whole shrink requirements. This has the effect of converting ONEOK Partners gross processing spread risk to NGL commodity price risk, and ONEOK Partners then uses financial instruments to hedge the sale of NGLs. The following table sets forth ONEOK Partners hedging information for the year ending December 31, 2009. Year Ending December 31, 2009 Volumes Hedged Average Price Percentage Hedged NGLs (Bbl/d) (a) 5,010 $ 1.18 / gallon 57% Condensate (Bbl/d) (a) 666 $ 3.23 / gallon 32% Total liquid sales (Bbl/d) 5,676 $ 1.42 / gallon 52% (a) Hedged with fixed price swaps. 63 Table of Contents ONEOK Partners commodity price risk is estimated as a hypothetical change in the price of NGLs, crude oil and natural gas at December 31, 2008, excluding the effects of hedging and assuming normal operating conditions. ONEOK Partners condensate sales are based on the price of crude oil. ONEOK Partners estimates the following: a $0.01 per gallon decrease in the composite price of NGLs would decrease annual net margin by approximately $1.2 million; a $1.00 per barrel decrease in the price of crude oil would decrease annual net margin by approximately $1.0 million; and a $0.10 per MMBtu decrease in the price of natural gas would decrease annual net margin by approximately $0.6 million. The above estimates of commodity price risk do not include any effects on demand for its services that might be caused by, or arise in conjunction with, price changes. For example, a change in the gross processing spread may cause a change in the amount of ethane extracted from the natural gas stream, impacting gathering and processing margins, NGL exchange revenues, natural gas deliveries, and NGL volumes shipped and fractionated. ONEOK Partners is also exposed to commodity price risk primarily as a result of NGLs in storage, the relative values of the various NGL products to each other, the relative value of NGLs to natural gas and the relative value of NGL purchases at one location and sales at another location, known as basis risk. ONEOK Partners utilizes fixed price physical forward contracts to reduce earnings volatility related to NGL price fluctuations. ONEOK Partners has not entered into any financial instruments with respect to its NGL marketing activities. In addition, ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk as its natural gas interstate and intrastate pipelines collect natural gas from its customers for operations or as part of its fee for services provided. When the amount of natural gas consumed in operations by these pipelines differs from the amount provided by its customers, the pipelines must buy or sell natural gas, or store or use natural gas from inventory, which exposes ONEOK Partners to commodity price risk. At December 31, 2008, there were no hedges in place with respect to natural gas price risk from ONEOK Partners natural gas pipeline business. Distribution Our Distribution segment uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of anticipated natural gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect their customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural gas. Gains or losses associated with these derivative instruments are included in, and recoverable through, the monthly purchased gas cost mechanism. Energy Services Our Energy Services segment is exposed to commodity price risk, basis risk and price volatility arising from natural gas in storage, requirement contracts, asset management contracts and index based purchases and sales of natural gas at various market locations. We minimize the volatility of our exposure to commodity price risk through the use of derivative instruments, which, under certain circumstances, are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. We are also exposed to commodity price risk from fixed price purchases and sales of natural gas, which we hedge with derivative instruments. Both the fixed price purchases and sales and related derivatives are recorded at fair value. Fair Value Component of the Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities The following table sets forth the fair value component of the energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities, excluding $21.0 million of net liabilities from derivative instruments declared as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair Value Component of Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities (Thousands of dollars) Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2007 $ 25,171 Derivatives reclassified or otherwise settled during the period (55,874 ) Fair value of new derivatives entered into during the period 236,772 Other changes in fair value 52,731 Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2008 (a) $ 258,800 (a) The maturities of derivatives are based on injection and withdrawal periods from April through March, which is consistent with our business strategy. The maturities are as follows: $225.0 million matures through March 2009, $33.9 million matures through March 2012 and $(0.1) million matures through March 2014. 64 Table of Contents The change in the net fair value of derivatives outstanding includes the effect of settled energy contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of market movements on the fair value of energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities. Fair value of new derivatives entered into during the period includes $298.8 million of cash flow hedges reclassified into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the write down of our natural gas in storage to its lower of weighted average cost or market. For further discussion of fair value measurements and trading activities and assumptions used in our trading activities, see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Also, see Notes C and D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Value at Risk (VAR) Disclosure of Commodity Price Risk We measure commodity price risk in our Energy Services segment using a VAR methodology, which estimates the expected maximum loss of our portfolio over a specified time horizon within a given confidence interval. Our VAR calculations are based on the Monte Carlo approach. The quantification of commodity price risk using VAR provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance and to determine risk thresholds. The use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions, including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation. Inputs to the calculation include prices, volatilities, positions, instrument valuations and the variance covariance matrix. Historical data is used to estimate our VAR with more weight given to recent data, which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements. We rely on VAR to determine the potential reduction in the portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period. While management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable, no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating VAR. Different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different VAR estimates. Our VAR exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized due to adverse commodity price movements in our Energy Services segments portfolio of derivative financial instruments, physical commodity contracts, leased transport, storage capacity contracts and natural gas in storage. A one day time horizon and a 95 percent confidence level are used in our VAR data. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the VAR calculation based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices, operating exposures and timing thereof, and the changes in our derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and natural gas in storage. VAR information should be evaluated in light of these assumptions and the methodologys other limitations. The potential impact on our future earnings, as measured by VAR, was $7.9 million and $6.0 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The following table details the average, high and low VAR calculations for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Value at Risk 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Average $ 12.3 $ 8.9 High $ 24.9 $ 23.0 Low $ 4.0 $ 3.4 Our VAR calculation includes derivatives, executory storage and transportation agreements and their related hedges. The variations in the VAR data are reflective of market volatility and changes in our portfolio during the year. The increase in average VAR for 2008, compared with 2007, was primarily due to a significant increase in natural gas prices during the second quarter of 2008. Our VAR calculation uses historical prices, placing more emphasis on the most recent price movements. We revised our assumptions in the third quarter of 2008 to decrease the weight given to the most recent price changes and spread the relative weighting over more historical data. This methodology reduces the effects of the market anomalies and better reflects an efficient market. We believe this methodology is more reflective of portfolio risk and have applied the change on a prospective basis. During 2008, we also began calculating the VAR on our mark to market derivative positions, which reflects the risk associated with derivatives whose change in fair value will impact current period earnings. These transactions are subject to mark to market accounting treatment because they are not part of a hedging relationship under Statement 133. VAR associated with these derivative positions was not material during 2008. To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably. As a result, we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position. 65 Table of Contents INTEREST RATE RISK General We are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the normal course of business. We manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates. At December 31, 2008, the interest rate on 89.3 percent of our long term debt, exclusive of the debt of our ONEOK Partners segment, was fixed after considering the impact of interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2008, the interest rate on all of ONEOK Partners long term debt was fixed. We terminated a $100 million interest rate swap in the fourth quarter of 2008. The total value we received was $19.2 million, which includes $0.3 million of swap savings previously recorded. The remaining savings of $18.9 million will be recognized in interest expense over the remaining term of the debt instrument originally hedged. In the fourth quarter of 2008, our counterparties exercised the option to terminate two additional interest rate swap agreements totaling $140 million. The swap terminations were effective in December 2008 and January 2009. The total value we received for the terminated swaps was not material. At December 31, 2008, a 100 basis point move in the annual interest rate on all of our swapped long term debt would change our annual interest expense by $1.7 million before taxes. This 100 basis point change assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. If interest rates changed significantly, we would take actions to manage our exposure to the change. Since a specific action and the possible effects are uncertain, no change has been assumed. Fair Value Hedges See Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for discussion of the impact of interest rate swaps and net interest expense savings from terminated swaps. Total net swap savings for 2008 were $17.4 million, compared with $8.2 million for 2007. Total swap savings for 2009 are expected to be $10.5 million. CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK As a result of our Energy Services segments operations in Canada, we are exposed to currency exchange rate risk from our commodity purchases and sales related to our firm transportation and storage contracts. To reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, we use physical forward transactions, which result in an actual two way flow of currency on the settlement date since we exchange U.S. dollars for Canadian dollars with another party. We have not designated these transactions for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, the gains and losses associated with the change in fair value are recorded in net margin. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our exposure to risk from currency translation was not material. We recognized a currency translation loss of $3.1 million during 2008 and currency translation gains of $4.1 million and $2.5 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK ONEOK and ONEOK Partners assess the creditworthiness of their counterparties on an on going basis and require security, including prepayments and other forms of cash collateral, when appropriate. 66 Table of Contents
