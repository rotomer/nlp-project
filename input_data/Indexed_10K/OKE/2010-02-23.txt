ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The following discussion highlights some of our achievements and significant issues affecting us during the past year. Please refer to the Capital Projects, Financial Results and Operating Information, and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and our consolidated financial statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Outlook We expect a moderate economic recovery in 2010, with inflationary pressures beginning in 2011. Although recent volatility in the financial markets could limit our access to financial markets on a timely basis or increase our cost of capital in the future, we anticipate improved credit markets during 2010, compared with 2009; however, inflation risks may increase the cost of capital. We anticipate the consolidation of underperforming assets in the industry, particularly those with high commodity price exposure and or high levels of debt. Additionally, we anticipate an improving commodity price environment during 2010, compared with 2009. Operating Results Diluted earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations (EPS) decreased to $2.87 in 2009, compared with $2.95 in 2008. Operating income for 2009 decreased to $894.6 million from $917.0 million for 2008. This decrease in operating income is due primarily to the following: lower realized commodity prices and narrower NGL product price differentials, offset partially by increased natural gas volumes processed and NGL volumes gathered, fractionated and transported in our ONEOK Partners segment; increased operating expenses in our ONEOK Partners segment, due primarily to higher employee related costs, the operation of the Overland Pass Pipeline and the Arbuckle Pipeline and increased costs at ONEOK Partners fractionation facilities, which includes the expanded Bushton Plant fractionator; and increased depreciation and amortization in our ONEOK Partners segment, due primarily to ONEOK Partners completed capital projects; offset partially by increased net margin in our Energy Services segment, due primarily to increased transportation margins, net of hedging activities, and increased premium services margins; and increased net margin in our Distribution segment, due primarily to capital recovery mechanisms. 37 Table of Contents ONEOK Partners Equity Issuances In July 2009, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of 5,486,690 common units, including the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option, at $45.81 per common unit, generating net proceeds of approximately $241.6 million. In conjunction with the offering, ONEOK Partners GP contributed an aggregate of $5.1 million to ONEOK Partners in order to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest. ONEOK Partners used the proceeds from the sale of common units and the general partner contributions to repay borrowings under the existing ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and for general partnership purposes. In February 2010, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of 5,500,900 common units, including the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option, at $60.75 per common unit, generating net proceeds of approximately $322.6 million. In conjunction with the offering, ONEOK Partners GP contributed $6.8 million in order to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest. ONEOK Partners used the proceeds from the sale of common units and the general partner contribution to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and for general partnership purposes. As a result of these transactions, we hold a 42.8 percent aggregate equity interest in ONEOK Partners. ONEOK Partners Debt Issuance In March 2009, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625 percent Senior Notes due 2019. ONEOK Partners used the net proceeds of approximately $494.3 million from the offering to repay indebtedness outstanding under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. Dividends/Distributions During 2009, we paid dividends totaling $1.64 per share, an increase of approximately 5 percent over the $1.56 per share paid during 2008. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share ($1.76 per share on an annualized basis) in January 2010, an increase of approximately 10 percent over the $0.40 declared in January 2009. During 2009, ONEOK Partners paid cash distributions totaling $4.33 per unit, an increase of approximately 3 percent over the $4.205 per unit paid during 2008. A cash distribution from ONEOK Partners of $1.10 per unit ($4.40 per unit on an annualized basis) was declared in January 2010, an increase of approximately 2 percent over the $1.08 declared in January 2009. Capital Projects ONEOK Partners placed the following projects in service during 2009: Guardian Pipelines natural gas pipeline expansion and extension project; Williston Basin natural gas processing plant expansion; Arbuckle natural gas liquids pipeline; D J Basin lateral natural gas liquids pipeline; and Piceance lateral natural gas liquids pipeline. SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES Acquisition of NGL Pipeline In October 2007, ONEOK Partners completed the acquisition of an interstate natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products pipeline system and related assets from a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (Kinder Morgan) for approximately $300 million, before working capital adjustments. The FERC regulated system extends from Bushton and Conway, Kansas, to Chicago, Illinois, and transports, stores and delivers a full range of NGL products and refined petroleum products. The transaction also included a 50 percent ownership interest in Heartland. ConocoPhillips owns the other 50 percent of Heartland and is the managing partner of the Heartland joint venture, which consists primarily of a refined petroleum products terminal and pipelines with access to two other refined petroleum products terminals. ONEOK Partners investment in Heartland is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Financing for this transaction came from a portion of the proceeds of ONEOK Partners September 2007 issuance of $600 million 6.85 percent Senior Notes due 2037. The working capital settlement was finalized in April 2008, with no material adjustments. CAPITAL PROJECTS All of the capital projects discussed below are in our ONEOK Partners segment. Overland Pass Pipeline In November 2008, Overland Pass Pipeline Company completed construction of a 760 mile natural gas liquids pipeline from Opal, Wyoming, to the Mid Continent natural gas liquids market center in Conway, Kansas. The Overland Pass Pipeline is designed to transport approximately 110 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs and can be increased to approximately 255 MBbl/d with additional pump facilities. Overland Pass Pipeline Company is a joint venture between ONEOK Partners and a subsidiary of The Williams Companies, Inc. (Williams). A subsidiary of ONEOK Partners owns 99 percent of the joint venture and operates the pipeline. On or before November 17, 2010, Williams has the option to increase its ownership in Overland Pass Pipeline Company, which includes the Piceance Lateral and D J Basin Lateral pipeline projects, up to 50 percent, with the purchase price being determined in accordance with the joint ventures operating agreement. If Williams exercises its option to increase its ownership to the full 50 percent, Williams would have the option 38 Table of Contents to become operator. If Williams does not elect to increase its ownership to at least 10 percent, ONEOK Partners will have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase Williams entire ownership interest, with the purchase price being determined in accordance with the joint ventures operating agreement. The project costs for the Overland Pass Pipeline, the Piceance Lateral Pipeline and the DJ Basin Lateral Pipeline in total are approximately $780 million, excluding AFUDC. As part of a long term agreement, Williams dedicated its NGL production from two of its natural gas processing plants in Wyoming, capable of delivering over 70 MBbl/d to the Overland Pass Pipeline. Subsidiaries of ONEOK Partners are providing downstream fractionation, storage and transportation services to Williams. ONEOK Partners has also reached agreements with certain producers for supply commitments to the D J Basin and Piceance Lateral pipelines. ONEOK Partners has NGL production dedicated from new and existing plants that it expects to provide throughput of more than 200 MBbl/d to the Overland Pass Pipeline over the next three to five years. ONEOK Partners also invested approximately $239 million, excluding AFUDC, to expand its existing fractionation and storage capabilities and to increase the capacity of its natural gas liquids distribution pipelines. Part of this expansion included adding new fractionation facilities at ONEOK Partners Bushton, Kansas, location, which increased the total fractionation capacity at the Bushton facility to 150 MBbl/d from 80 MBbl/d. The addition of the new facilities and the upgrade to the existing fractionator were completed in October 2008. Additionally, portions of the natural gas liquids distribution pipeline upgrades were completed in the second and third quarters of 2008. Piceance Lateral Pipeline In October 2009, Overland Pass Pipeline Company placed in service the 150 mile natural gas liquids lateral pipeline from the Piceance Basin in Colorado to the Overland Pass Pipeline. The pipeline has capacity to transport as much as 100 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs. Williams has dedicated its NGL production from its new Willow Creek natural gas processing plant, and will dedicate NGL production from an additional existing natural gas processing plant. Another plant owned by a third party has also been dedicated. ONEOK Partners continues to negotiate with other producers for supply commitments. D J Basin Lateral Pipeline In March 2009, Overland Pass Pipeline Company placed in service the 125 mile natural gas liquids lateral pipeline from the Denver Julesburg Basin in northeastern Colorado to the Overland Pass Pipeline. The pipeline has capacity to transport as much as 55 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs. ONEOK Partners continues to discuss with its producers opportunities from new drilling and plant upgrades over the next two years. Arbuckle Natural Gas Liquids Pipeline In August 2009, the 440 mile Arbuckle pipeline project, a natural gas liquids pipeline system that delivers unfractionated NGLs from points in southern Oklahoma and Texas to the Texas Gulf Coast was placed in service. The Arbuckle pipeline system has the capacity to transport 160 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs, expandable to 240 MBbl/d with additional pump facilities, and connects ONEOK Partners existing Mid Continent infrastructure with its fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas, and other Gulf Coast region fractionators. ONEOK Partners has NGL production dedicated from existing and new natural gas processing plants that it expects to provide throughput of more than 210 MBbl/d over the next three to five years. The demand for surface easements increased dramatically in Texas and Oklahoma over the last two years because of increased oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, as well as pipeline construction. As previously reported, project costs have been more expensive than originally estimated due to delays associated with right of way acquisition, increased materials costs and difficult construction conditions associated with several weeks of heavy spring rains in 2009, resulting in greatly reduced construction productivity. ONEOK Partners also experienced increased costs due to a number of scope changes, arising primarily from additional supply development opportunities. ONEOK Partners estimates project costs will be approximately $490 million, excluding AFUDC, for the current capacity. Williston Basin Gas Processing Plant Expansion The expansion of ONEOK Partners Grasslands natural gas processing facility in North Dakota was placed in service in March 2009. The expansion increased processing capacity to approximately 100 MMcf/d from its previous capacity of 63 MMcf/d and increased fractionation capacity to approximately 12 MBbl/d from 8 MBbl/d. The cost of the project was approximately $46 million, excluding AFUDC. Guardian Pipeline Expansion and Extension In February 2009, ONEOK Partners completed the 119 mile extension of its Guardian Pipeline. The pipeline has capacity to transport 537 MMcf/d of natural gas north from Ixonia, Wisconsin, to the Green Bay, Wisconsin, area. The project is supported by 15 year shipper commitments with We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, and the capacity is close to fully subscribed. The project cost approximately $320 million, excluding AFUDC. 39 Table of Contents REGULATORY It is unclear how Congress and the current Administrations efforts to improve market transparency and stabilize the over the counter (OTC) derivative markets will impact our ability to access OTC energy derivatives products and markets, which are critical to our business. We currently use the OTC markets to manage business risks including fluctuating commodity prices, interest rates, currency rates and for the hedging of inventory and capacity contracts. Most of the current proposals before Congress contain exemptions for these activities that would limit the impact on our operations. Additional matters associated with these proposals that are not yet defined include the potential for increased capital requirements and a reduction in the overall liquidity of the markets. There may also be an administrative burden of new reporting and record keeping required by one or more of the federal agencies providing market oversight. In addition, the EPA has issued a proposed rule on air quality standards, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines, also known as RICE NESHAP, scheduled to be adopted in early 2013. The proposed rule will require capital expenditures over the next three years for the purchase and installation of new emissions control equipment. We do not expect these expenditures to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Several regulatory initiatives positively impacted the earnings and future earnings potential for our Distribution segment. See discussion of our Distribution segments regulatory initiative beginning on page 49. IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Information about the impact of new accounting standards is included in Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report: references to accounting standards literature under the FASB Accounting Standards Codification; presentation and disclosure requirements for noncontrolling interests; enhanced disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities; ASU 2010 06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements; enhanced disclosures about our postretirement benefit plan assets; and disclosure of subsequent events review. The above accounting standards did not or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, results of operations or cash flows. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates. The following is a summary of our most critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those estimates most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters. We have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Fair Value Measurements Determining Fair Value We define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We use the market and income approaches to determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities and consider the markets in which the transactions are executed. While many of the contracts in our portfolio are executed in liquid markets where price transparency exists, some contracts are executed in markets for which market prices may exist but the market may be relatively inactive. This results in limited price transparency that requires managements judgment and assumptions to estimate fair values. Inputs into our fair value estimates include commodity exchange prices, over the counter quotes, volatility, historical correlations of pricing data and LIBOR and other liquid money market instrument rates. We also utilize internally developed basis curves that incorporate observable and unobservable market data. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources, where available. In addition, as prescribed by the income approach, we compute the fair value of our derivative portfolio by discounting the projected future cash flows 40 Table of Contents from our derivative assets and liabilities to present value. The interest rate yields used to calculate the present value discount factors are derived from LIBOR, Eurodollar futures and Treasury swaps. The projected cash flows are then multiplied by the appropriate discount factors to determine the present value or fair value of our derivative instruments. We also take into consideration the potential impact on market prices of liquidating positions in an orderly manner and over a reasonable period of time using current market conditions. We consider current market data in evaluating counterparties nonperformance risk by using specific and sector bond yields and also monitor the credit default swap markets, net of collateral, as well as our own risk of nonperformance. Although we use our best estimates to determine the fair value of the derivative contracts we have executed, the ultimate market prices realized could differ from our estimates, and the differences could be material. Fair Value Hierarchy We utilize a fair value hierarchy to prioritize inputs to valuation techniques based on observable and unobservable data and categorize the inputs into three levels, with the highest priority given to Level 1 and the lowest priority given to Level 3. The levels are described below: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Significant observable pricing inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Essentially, this represents inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data; and Level 3 May include one or more unobservable inputs that are significant in establishing a fair value estimate. These unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available and may include our own internal data. Determining the appropriate classification of our fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy requires managements judgment regarding the degree to which market data is observable or corroborated by observable market data. Transfers in and out of Level 3 typically result from derivatives for which fair value is determined based on multiple inputs. If prices change for a particular input from the previous measurement date to the current measurement date, the impact could result in the derivative being moved between Level 2 and Level 3, depending upon managements judgment of the significance of the price change of that particular input to the total fair value of the derivative. See Note C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more discussion of fair value measurements. Derivatives, Accounting for Financially Settled Transactions and Risk Management Activities We engage in wholesale energy marketing, retail marketing, trading and risk management activities. We record all derivative instruments at fair value, with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery. Market value changes result in a change in the fair value of our derivative instruments. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effective the hedging instrument is. If the derivative instrument does not qualify or is not designated as part of a hedging relationship, then we account for changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings as they occur. Commodity price volatility may have a significant impact on the gain or loss in any given period. For more information on fair value sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and condensate prices, we periodically enter into futures, forwards, options or swap transactions in order to hedge anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs and condensate and fuel requirements. Interest rate swaps are also used to manage interest rate risk. Under certain conditions, we designate these derivative instruments as a hedge against our exposure to changes in fair values or cash flow. For hedges of exposure to changes in cash flow, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently recorded to earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness of designated hedges is reported in earnings during the period the ineffectiveness occurs. For hedges against our exposure in changes in fair value, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings during the period of change together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. We do not believe that changes in our fair value estimates of our derivative instruments have a material impact on our results of operations as the majority of our derivatives are accounted for as hedges for which ineffectiveness is not material. Upon election, many of our purchase and sale agreements that otherwise would be required to follow the accounting for derivative instruments qualify as normal purchases and normal sales that result in physical delivery and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment. 41 Table of Contents See Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of derivatives and risk management activities. Impairment of Goodwill, Long lived Assets and Intangible Assets We assess our goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life for impairment at least annually as of July 1. There were no impairment charges resulting from our July 1, 2009, 2008 or 2007, impairment tests. As part of our impairment test, an initial assessment is made by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use two generally accepted valuation approaches, an income approach and a market approach. Under the income approach, we use anticipated cash flows over a period of years plus a terminal value and discount these amounts to their present value using appropriate rates of return that are consistent with a market participants perspective. Under the market approach, we apply multiples to forecasted cash flows. The multiples used are consistent with a market participants perspective of historical asset transactions. The forecasted cash flows are consistent with a market participants perspective of average forecasted cash flows for a reporting unit over a period of years. Our estimates of fair value significantly exceeded the book value of our reporting units and our indefinite lived intangible assets in our July 1, 2009, impairment test. Even if the estimated fair values used in our July 1, 2009, impairment test were reduced by 10 percent, no impairment charges would have resulted. The following table sets forth our goodwill, by segment, at both December 31, 2009 and 2008: (Thousands of dollars) ONEOK Partners $ 433,537 Distribution 157,953 Energy Services 10,255 Other 1,099 Total goodwill $ 602,844 See Notes A and F of the Note to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of goodwill and related disclosures. As part of our indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test, we compare the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets with their book values. The fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets is estimated using the market approach. Under the market approach, we apply multiples to forecasted cash flows of the assets associated with our indefinite lived intangible assets. The multiples used are consistent with a market participants perspective of historical asset transactions. We determined that there were no impairments to our indefinite lived intangible assets in 2009 or 2008. We had $427.7 million and $435.4 million of intangible assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of which $272.2 million and $279.8 million, respectively, was recorded in our ONEOK Partners segment. We assess our long lived assets, including intangible assets with a finite useful life, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. In step one of the impairment test, the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long lived asset. This type of analysis requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. We determined that there were no asset impairments in 2009, 2008 or 2007. For the investments we account for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. Therefore, we periodically re evaluate the amount at which we carry our equity method investments to determine whether current events or circumstances warrant adjustments to our carrying value. We determined that there were no impairments to our investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2009, 2008 or 2007. Our impairment tests require the use of assumptions and estimates. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an impairment charge. 42 Table of Contents Pension and Postretirement Employee Benefits We have defined benefit retirement plans covering certain full time employees. We sponsor welfare plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees who retire with at least five years of service. Our actuarial consultant calculates the expense and liability related to these plans and uses statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, age and employment periods. In determining the projected benefit obligations and costs, assumptions can change from period to period and result in material changes in the costs and liabilities we recognize. See Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional information. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for our health care plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects. One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Thousands of dollars) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 1,836 $ (1,586 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 20,518 $ (17,803 ) During 2009, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $31.7 million related to our defined benefit pension plans and $26.1 million related to postretirement benefits. We estimate that in 2010, we will record net periodic benefit costs of $32.6 million related to our defined benefit pension plans and $20.9 million related to postretirement benefits. In determining our estimated expenses for 2010, we assumed an 8.50 percent expected return on plan assets and a discount rate of 6.00 percent. A decrease in our expected return on plan assets to 8.25 percent would increase our 2010 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $2.1 million for our defined benefit pension plans and would not have a significant impact on our postretirement benefit plan. A decrease in our assumed discount rate to 5.75 percent would increase our 2010 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $2.9 million for our defined benefit pension plans and would not have a significant impact on our postretirement benefit plan. For 2010, we anticipate our total contributions to our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plan to be $43.3 million and $12.4 million, respectively, and the expected benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plan are estimated to be $15.4 million. Contingencies Our accounting for contingencies covers a variety of business activities, including contingencies for legal and environmental exposures. We accrue these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated. We base our estimates on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remediation feasibility study. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. Our expenditures for environmental evaluation, mitigation, remediation and compliance to date have not been significant in relation to our financial position or results of operations, and our expenditures related to environmental matters had no material effects upon earnings or cash flows during 2009, 2008 and 2007. Actual results may differ from our estimates resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on earnings. See Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of contingencies. 43 Table of Contents FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATING INFORMATION Consolidated Operations Selected Financial Results The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Financial Results 2009 2008 2007 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Revenues $ 11,111.6 $ 16,157.4 $ 13,477.4 $ (5,045.8 ) (31 %) $ 2,680.0 20 % Cost of sales and fuel 9,095.7 14,221.9 11,667.3 (5,126.2 ) (36 %) 2,554.6 22 % Net margin 2,015.9 1,935.5 1,810.1 80.4 4 % 125.4 7 % Operating costs 837.1 776.9 761.5 60.2 8 % 15.4 2 % Depreciation and amortization 289.0 243.9 228.0 45.1 18 % 15.9 7 % Gain (loss) on sale of assets 4.8 2.3 1.9 2.5 * 0.4 21 % Operating income $ 894.6 $ 917.0 $ 822.5 $ (22.4 ) (2 %) $ 94.5 11 % Equity earnings from investments $ 72.7 $ 101.4 $ 89.9 $ (28.7 ) (28 %) $ 11.5 13 % Allowance for equity funds used during construction $ 26.9 $ 50.9 $ 12.5 $ (24.0 ) (47 %) $ 38.4 * Interest expense $ (300.8 ) $ (264.2 ) $ (256.3 ) $ 36.6 14 % $ 7.9 3 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests $ (185.8 ) $ (288.6 ) $ (193.2 ) $ (102.8 ) (36 %) $ 95.4 49 % Capital expenditures $ 791.2 $ 1,473.1 $ 883.7 $ (681.9 ) (46 %) $ 589.4 67 % * Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 2009 vs. 2008 Energy markets were affected by lower commodity prices during 2009, compared with 2008. The decrease in commodity prices had a direct impact on our revenues and cost of sales and fuel. Net margin increased due primarily to the following: increased net margin in our Energy Services segment, due primarily to: increased transportation margins, net of hedging activities; increased premium services margins; increased storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities; and increased retail marketing margins; increased net margin in our Distribution segment, due primarily to capital recovery mechanisms and revenue rider recoveries; offset partially by decreased net margin in our ONEOK Partners segment, due primarily to: lower realized commodity prices and narrower NGL product price differentials; offset partially by increased NGL volumes gathered, fractionated and transported, primarily associated with the completion of the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects, and the Arbuckle Pipeline, as well as new NGL supply connections; increased natural gas transportation margins from the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension that was completed in February 2009 and an increase in volumes contracted on Midwestern Gas Transmission in ONEOK Partners natural gas pipelines business; and increased natural gas volumes processed and sold in our ONEOK Partners segments gathering and processing business. Operating costs increased due primarily to higher employee related costs, incremental costs associated with the operation of the Overland Pass Pipeline, the Arbuckle Pipeline and the expanded Bushton Plant fractionator, outside services expenses and general taxes related to the completed capital projects in our ONEOK Partners segment, and increased employee related costs in our Distribution segment. These increases were slightly offset by lower bad debt expense in our Distribution segment. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of ONEOK Partners completed capital projects. Equity earnings from investments decreased due primarily to lower subscription volumes and rates on Northern Border Pipeline, of which ONEOK Partners owns a 50 percent interest. Additionally, there was a gain on the sale of Bison Pipeline 44 Table of Contents LLC by Northern Border Pipeline in 2008. Equity earnings from investments also decreased due to lower natural gas volumes gathered in ONEOK Partners various natural gas gathering and processing equity investments, whose assets are primarily located in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. Allowance for equity funds used during construction decreased due primarily to the completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline, the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects, and the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension. Interest expense increased due primarily to ONEOK Partners March 2009 debt issuance and a decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of ONEOK Partners capital projects, offset partially by decreased borrowings by ONEOK. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2009 and 2008 primarily reflects the remaining 54.9 percent and 52.3 percent, respectively, of ONEOK Partners that we do not own. The decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was due to the decreased income of our ONEOK Partners segment. Capital expenditures decreased due to the completion of the capital projects in our ONEOK Partners segment. 2008 vs. 2007 Energy markets were affected by higher commodity prices during 2008, compared with 2007. The increase in commodity prices had a direct impact on our revenues and cost of sales and fuel. Net margin increased due primarily to the following: increased net margin in our ONEOK Partners segment, due primarily to: wider NGL product price differentials; higher realized commodity prices; incremental net margin associated with the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan; and increased NGL gathering and fractionation volumes; increased margin in our Distribution segment, due primarily to the implementation of new rate mechanisms; offset partially by decreased margin in our Energy Services segment, due primarily to a decrease in storage and marketing margins and transportation margins, net of hedging activities. Operating costs increased due primarily to incremental operating expenses associated with the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan, increased outside services primarily associated with scheduled maintenance activities at ONEOK Partners Medford, Oklahoma, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, fractionators, and chemical costs. Operating costs also increased due to costs associated with the startup of the newly expanded Bushton, Kansas, fractionator and Overland Pass Pipeline, both in our ONEOK Partners segment. Depreciation and amortization increased due primarily to the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan and depreciation expense associated with ONEOK Partners completed capital projects. Additionally, our Distribution segment had an increase in depreciation and amortization, due primarily to additional investment in property, plant and equipment. Equity earnings from investments increased due primarily to ONEOK Partners share of the gain on the sale of Bison Pipeline LLC by Northern Border Pipeline in 2008, and ONEOK Partners earnings related to higher gathering revenues in its natural gas gathering and processing business various investments, offset partially by reduced throughput on Northern Border Pipeline. Allowance for equity funds used during construction and capital expenditures increased due to ONEOK Partners capital projects. Interest expense increased due primarily to increased borrowings to fund ONEOK Partners capital projects. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2008 and 2007 reflects the remaining 52.3 percent and 54.3 percent, respectively, of ONEOK Partners that we did not own. The increase in 2008 is due to the increase in income for our ONEOK Partners segment, offset partially by our increased equity ownership interest in ONEOK Partners. More information regarding our results of operations is provided in the following discussion of operating results for each of our segments. 45 Table of Contents ONEOK Partners Selected Financial Results and Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected financial results and operating information for our ONEOK Partners segment for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Financial Results 2009 2008 2007 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Revenues $ 6,474.5 $ 7,720.2 $ 5,831.6 $ (1,245.7 ) (16 %) $ 1,888.6 32 % Cost of sales and fuel 5,355.2 6,579.5 4,935.7 (1,224.3 ) (19 %) 1,643.8 33 % Net margin 1,119.3 1,140.7 895.9 (21.4 ) (2 %) 244.8 27 % Operating costs 411.3 371.8 337.4 39.5 11 % 34.4 10 % Depreciation and amortization 164.1 124.8 113.7 39.3 31 % 11.1 10 % Gain (loss) on sale of assets 2.7 0.7 2.0 2.0 * (1.3 ) (65 %) Operating income $ 546.6 $ 644.8 $ 446.8 $ (98.2 ) (15 %) $ 198.0 44 % Equity earnings from investments $ 72.7 $ 101.4 $ 89.9 $ (28.7 ) (28 %) $ 11.5 13 % Allowance for equity funds used during construction $ 26.9 $ 50.9 $ 12.5 $ (24.0 ) (47 %) $ 38.4 * Interest expense $ (206.0 ) $ (151.1 ) $ (138.9 ) $ 54.9 36 % $ 12.2 9 % Capital expenditures $ 615.7 $ 1,253.9 $ 709.9 $ (638.2 ) (51 %) $ 544.0 77 % * Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 2009 vs. 2008 Net margin decreased due primarily to the following: a decrease of $106.0 million due to lower realized commodity prices in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business; and a decrease of $41.7 million due to narrower NGL product price differentials in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business; offset partially by an increase of $68.7 million due to increased NGL volumes gathered, fractionated and transported, primarily associated with the completion of the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects, and the Arbuckle Pipeline, as well as new NGL supply connections in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business; an increase of $38.8 million due to higher natural gas transportation margins from the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension that was completed in February 2009 and an increase in volumes contracted on Midwestern Gas Transmission in ONEOK Partners natural gas pipelines business; and an increase of $22.3 million due to higher volumes processed and sold in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business. Operating costs increased due primarily to higher employee related costs, incremental costs associated with the operation of the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects, and the Arbuckle Pipeline and costs associated with the expanded Bushton Plant fractionator. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of ONEOK Partners completed capital projects. Equity earnings from investments decreased due primarily to lower subscription volumes and rates on Northern Border Pipeline. Additionally, there was a gain on the sale of Bison Pipeline LLC by Northern Border Pipeline in the third quarter of 2008. Equity earnings from investments also decreased due to lower natural gas volumes gathered in ONEOK Partners various natural gas gathering and processing equity investments whose assets are primarily located in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. Allowance for equity funds used during construction decreased due primarily to the completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline in July 2009, the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects, and the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension that was placed in service in February 2009. Interest expense increased due primarily to ONEOK Partners March 2009 debt issuance and a decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of ONEOK Partners capital projects. Capital expenditures decreased due primarily to the completions of ONEOK Partners capital projects. 46 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 Net margin increased due primarily to the following: an increase in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business due to the following: an increase of $88.6 million due to more favorable NGL product price differentials; an increase of $58.7 million due to increased volumes gathered, fractionated and transported, primarily resulting from increased volumes on the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan in October 2007, the completion of the Overland Pass Pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2008 and other new supply connections; offset partially by increased fuel costs associated with these higher volumes; and an increase of $8.4 million in certain operational measurement gains, primarily at NGL storage caverns; an increase in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business due to the following: an increase of $58.4 million due to higher realized commodity prices; an increase of $11.9 million due to improved contractual terms; an increase of $7.0 million due to higher volumes sold and processed; offset partially by a decrease of $8.6 million due to a one time favorable contract settlement that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2007; and an increase of $11.7 million due to increased transportation and storage margins primarily as a result of the impact of higher natural gas prices on retained fuel, and new and renegotiated storage contracts in ONEOK Partners natural gas business. Operating costs increased due primarily to incremental operating expenses associated with the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan, increased outside service costs primarily associated with scheduled maintenance activities at ONEOK Partners Medford, Oklahoma, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, fractionators, and chemical costs. Operating costs also increased due to costs associated with the startup of ONEOK Partners newly expanded Bushton, Kansas, fractionator and Overland Pass Pipeline. Depreciation and amortization increased due primarily to depreciation expense associated with ONEOK Partners completed capital projects and the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan. Equity earnings from investments increased due primarily to higher gathering revenues in ONEOK Partners various investments, as well as an $8.3 million gain on the sale of Bison Pipeline LLC by Northern Border Pipeline in 2008, offset partially by reduced throughput on Northern Border Pipeline. ONEOK Partners owns a 50 percent equity interest in Northern Border Pipeline. Allowance for equity funds used during construction and capital expenditures increased due to ONEOK Partners capital projects. Interest expense increased due primarily to increased borrowings to fund ONEOK Partners capital projects.

Operating costs increased due primarily to the following: an increase of $20.8 million in employee related costs; and an increase of $3.4 million in property tax expense; offset partially by a decrease of $10.3 million in bad debt expense as a result of the authorized recovery of the fuel related portion of bad debts in Oklahoma, effective January 2009; and a decrease of $5.3 million in vehicle related costs. Depreciation and amortization expense increased due primarily to the following: an increase of $4.8 million in regulatory amortization associated with previously deferred costs that have been approved for recovery in our revenues; and an increase of $1.0 million in depreciation expense related to our investment in property, plant and equipment. 2008 vs. 2007 Net margin increased due primarily to: an increase of $15.7 million resulting from the implementation of new rate mechanisms, which includes a $12.4 million increase in Oklahoma and a $3.3 million increase in Texas; and an increase of $2.2 million related to recovery of carrying costs for natural gas in storage. Operating costs decreased due primarily to: a decrease of $4.3 million in employee related costs; and a decrease of $1.0 million in bad debt expense; offset partially by an increase of $2.4 million in fuel related vehicle costs. Depreciation and amortization increased due primarily to: an increase of $4.0 million in depreciation expense related to our investment in property, plant and equipment; and an increase of $1.2 million of regulatory amortization associated with revenue rider recoveries. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditure program includes expenditures for extending service to new areas, modifications to customer service lines, increasing system capabilities, general replacements and improvements. It is our practice to maintain and upgrade facilities to ensure safe, reliable and efficient operations. Our capital expenditure program included $37.3 million, $51.8 million and $50.6 million for new business development in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 48 Table of Contents Capital expenditures decreased for 2009, compared with the same periods last year, primarily as a result of lower spending on growth projects due to the economic slowdowns experienced in our service territories during 2009. Selected Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected operating information for our Distribution segment for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, Volumes (MMcf) 2009 2008 2007 Gas sales Residential 120,370 125,834 121,587 Commercial 35,414 37,758 37,295 Industrial 1,208 1,395 1,758 Wholesale 10,032 7,186 13,231 Public Authority 2,673 2,592 2,679 Total volumes sold 169,697 174,765 176,550 Transportation 201,952 219,398 204,049 Total volumes delivered 371,649 394,163 380,599 Years Ended December 31, Net margin, excluding other revenues 2009 2008 2007 Gas Sales (Millions of dollars) Residential $ 473.8 $ 444.0 $ 440.9 Commercial 105.1 101.3 99.5 Industrial 2.5 2.6 2.3 Wholesale 0.4 0.6 1.2 Public Authority 4.1 3.8 3.7 Net margin on gas sales 585.9 552.3 547.6 Transportation margin 87.6 87.3 80.6 Net margin, excluding other revenues $ 673.5 $ 639.6 $ 628.2 Years Ended December 31, Number of Customers 2009 2008 2007 Residential 1,901,782 1,886,118 1,876,054 Commercial 156,337 159,748 160,517 Industrial 1,343 1,420 1,455 Wholesale 27 28 27 Public Authority 2,740 2,963 2,952 Transportation 10,410 10,376 9,762 Total customers 2,072,639 2,060,653 2,050,767 Residential volumes decreased during 2009, compared with 2008, due to warmer temperatures across our entire service territory; however, the impact on margin decreases was moderated by weather normalization mechanisms. Residential volumes increased during 2008, compared with 2007, due primarily to colder temperatures in our Oklahoma and Kansas service territories; however, the impact on margin increases was moderated by weather normalization mechanisms. Wholesale sales represent contracted gas volumes that exceed the needs of our residential, commercial and industrial customer base and are available for sale to other parties. Public authority natural gas volumes reflect volumes used by state agencies and school districts served by Texas Gas Service. Regulatory Initiatives Oklahoma In December 2008, the OCC approved a final order to increase the recovery level of Oklahoma Natural Gas Capital Investment Mechanism (CIM) to $12.6 million from $7.6 million annually. The recovery mechanism allows Oklahoma Natural Gas to collect a rate of return, depreciation and 50 percent of the property tax expense associated with 49 Table of Contents incremental capital investments to maintain its facilities since its 2005 rate case. The increased recovery level was effective in January 2009. In August 2009, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed the 2009 CIM application with the OCC increasing the level of recoveries to $17.3 million through the CIM rider. In November 2009, the OCC approved a final order to authorize the CIM recoveries of $17.3 million earned in 2009, which will be collected from customers beginning in January 2010. The impact from the OCC order was an increase in revenues of $17.3 million in 2009. In December 2008, the OCC issued a final order authorizing Oklahoma Natural Gas to defer the fuel related portion of bad debts for recovery in the purchased gas adjustment mechanism. The associated deferrals began in January 2009 and are expected to be recovered in the monthly purchased gas cost adjustment mechanism in 2010. In 2005, the OCC authorized Oklahoma Natural Gas transmission pipeline Integrity Management Program (IMP), intended to comply with the Federal Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. An IMP application was filed at the OCC in January 2009, requesting recovery of all costs incurred, deferred and not recovered (inclusive of operations and maintenance expense, depreciation, property taxes and a rate of return) through base rates associated with IMP deferrals for 2008 and annual true ups associated with the prior recovery period. In June 2009, the OCC approved this application for recovery of $10.5 million in IMP costs. In May 2009, the OCC approved Oklahoma Natural Gas and the OCC Staffs joint application for a performance based rate change mechanism. A performance based rate structure shares efficiency savings with customers, alleviates the need for multiple tariff filings, saving ratepayers the cost of such frequent filings, and allows for timely oversight of Oklahoma Natural Gas capital investment decisions. In June 2009, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed an application with the OCC requesting an increase of approximately $66.1 million in base rates, which includes existing riders that would effectively reduce the requested rate increase to a net amount of $37.6 million. On October 28, 2009, Oklahoma Natural Gas, the OCC Staff, the Oklahoma Attorney General and other intervening parties signed and filed a Stipulation Settlement in this case. In December 2009, the Commission approved a rate increase of $54.5 million, which includes existing riders that would effectively reduce the rate increase to a net amount of $25.7 million, and the new rates went into effect on December 18, 2009. The estimated impact on 2010 operating income is $14 million. On January 27, 2010, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed an application and supporting testimony requesting recovery of the IMP deferral for 2009 and annual adjustments associated with the prior recovery period in the amount of $15.7 million. Kansas In December 2008, the KCC approved Kansas Gas Services request to impose a surcharge designed to annually collect approximately $2.9 million in costs associated with its Gas System Reliability Surcharge (GSRS) mechanism. The GSRS mechanism allows natural gas utilities to earn a return and recover carrying costs associated with investments made to comply with state and federal pipeline safety requirements or costs to relocate existing facilities pursuant to requests made by a government entity. The authorized GSRS collections were billed effective with customer billings on January 1, 2009. In December 2009, the KCC approved Kansas Gas Services application to increase the GSRS, resulting in a $3.9 million increase in operating income for 2010, effective with customer billings in January 2010. In September 2009, the KCC authorized us to defer the difference between current GAAP pension and post retirement expenses and the level of these expenses incorporated in base rates as either a regulatory asset or liability. In conjunction with the deferral, we are required to fund the applicable amount of our pension and post retirement costs. Amortization and recovery of the accumulated deferrals will begin with the effective date of our next rate change and will continue for a period not to exceed five years. The impact from the KCC order was a decrease in operating expenses of $3.0 million for 2009. In December 2009, Kansas Gas Service filed an application with the KCC to become an Efficiency Kansas Loan Program utility partner, contingent upon the commission approving a rate mechanism that would recover losses from declining sales and an energy conservation rider to recover program costs. Texas In June 2009, Austin and the surrounding cities in our central Texas service area approved an increase in base rates of $1.1 million and a $5.0 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, plus recovery of the fuel related portion of bad debts and carrying costs for natural gas in storage. The new rates were effective July 2009. 50 Table of Contents In August 2009, the cities of the Rio Grande Valley service area approved an increase in base rates of $1.3 million and a $1.6 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, plus recovery of the fuel related portion of bad debts. The new rates were effective September 2009. In December 2009, Texas Gas Service filed a statement of intent to increase rates in its El Paso service area by $7.3 million. If approved, new rates will become effective by May 2010. General Certain costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process have been capitalized as regulatory assets. Should recovery cease due to regulatory actions, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for recognition and accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. There were no write offs of regulatory assets resulting from the failure to meet the criteria for capitalization during 2009 or 2008. Energy Services Selected Financial Results The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for our Energy Services segment for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Financial Results 2009 2008 2007 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Revenues $ 3,595.5 $ 7,585.8 $ 6,629.4 $ (3,990.3 ) (53 %) $ 956.4 14 % Cost of sales and fuel 3,417.9 7,475.1 6,382.0 (4,057.2 ) (54 %) 1,093.1 17 % Net margin 177.6 110.7 247.4 66.9 60 % (136.7 ) (55 %) Operating costs 41.7 35.6 39.9 6.1 17 % (4.3 ) (11 %) Depreciation and amortization 0.6 0.9 2.1 (0.3 ) (33 %) (1.2 ) (57 %) Gain on sale of assets 1.5 (1.5 ) (100 %) 1.5 100 % Operating income $ 135.3 $ 75.7 $ 205.4 $ 59.6 79 % $ (129.7 ) (63 %) Capital expenditures $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 0 % $ (0.1 ) (50 %) The following table shows our margins by activity for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 2009 2008 2007 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Marketing, storage and transportation, gross $ 367.7 $ 313.4 $ 409.1 $ 54.3 17 % $ (95.7 ) (23 %) Storage and transportation costs 211.2 219.8 191.9 (8.6 ) (4 %) 27.9 15 % Marketing, storage and transportation, net 156.5 93.6 217.2 62.9 67 % (123.6 ) (57 %) Retail marketing, net 18.0 14.8 14.0 3.2 22 % 0.8 6 % Financial trading, net 3.1 2.3 16.2 0.8 35 % (13.9 ) (86 %) Net margin $ 177.6 $ 110.7 $ 247.4 $ 66.9 60 % $ (136.7 ) (55 %) Marketing, storage and transportation, gross, primarily includes marketing, purchases and sales, premium services and the impact of cash flow and fair value hedges, and other derivative instruments used to manage our risk associated with these activities. Storage and transportation costs primarily include the cost of leasing capacity, storage injection and withdrawal fees, fuel charges and gathering fees. Risk management and operational decisions have an impact on the net result of our marketing, premium services and storage activities. We evaluate our strategies on an ongoing basis to optimize the value of our contracted assets and to minimize the financial impact of market conditions on the services we provide. Retail marketing includes net margin from providing physical marketing, supply services and risk management services to residential, municipal, and small commercial and industrial customers. Financial trading net margin includes activities that are generally executed using financially settled derivatives. These activities are normally short term in nature, with a focus on capturing short term price volatility. Revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income include financial trading margins, as well as certain physical natural gas transactions with our trading counterparties. Revenues and cost of sales and fuel from such physical transactions are reported on a net basis. 51 Table of Contents 2009 vs. 2008 Net margin increased due primarily to the following: an increase of $41.3 million in transportation margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to higher realized Rocky Mountain to Mid Continent transportation margins, resulting from the following: realization of more favorable hedges related to transportation spreads; and favorable unrealized fair value changes on non qualifying economic hedge activity and ineffectiveness on qualified hedges; an increase of $13.9 million in premium services, primarily associated with managing our demand load, due to warmer weather in the first quarter of 2009, offset partially by increased peaking demand load due to colder than normal weather in the fourth quarter of 2009; an increase of $7.8 million in storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to the following: favorable unrealized fair value changes on non qualifying economic hedge activity and marketing margin; and the impact of a lower of cost or market inventory write down of $9.7 million in the third quarter 2008; offset partially by lower realized seasonal storage differentials; and an increase of $3.2 million in retail marketing margins. Operating costs increased due to higher legal related costs and employee related costs. 2008 vs. 2007 Net margin decreased due primarily to the following: a net decrease of $40.3 million in transportation margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to decreased basis differentials between the Rocky Mountain and Mid Continent regions, and increased transportation related costs in 2008; a decrease of $13.9 million in financial trading margins; a decrease of $3.4 million in premium services, primarily due to colder than anticipated weather and market conditions that increased supply costs of providing these services; and a net decrease of $79.9 million in storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to: hedging opportunities associated with weather related events that led to higher storage margins in 2007 compared with 2008; lower 2008 storage margins related to storage risk management positions and the impact of changes in natural gas prices on these positions; and fewer opportunities to optimize storage capacity due to the significant decline in natural gas prices in the second half of 2008; the impact of a lower of cost or market inventory write down of $9.7 million in the third quarter of 2008; offset partially by changes in the unrealized fair value of derivative instruments associated with storage and marketing activities and improved marketing margins, which benefited from price movements and optimization activities. Operating costs decreased due primarily to lower employee related costs. Selected Operating Information The following table sets forth certain selected operating information for our Energy Services segment for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2009 2008 2007 Natural gas marketed (Bcf) 1,107 1,160 1,191 Natural gas gross margin ($/Mcf) $ 0.14 $ 0.07 $ 0.19 Physically settled volumes (Bcf) 2,222 2,359 2,370 Our natural gas in storage at December 31, 2009, was 60.8 Bcf, compared with 81.9 Bcf at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, our total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 82.8 Bcf, with maximum withdrawal capability of 2.3 Bcf/d and maximum injection capability of 1.4 Bcf/d. Our current natural gas transportation capacity is 1.7 Bcf/d. Natural gas volumes marketed decreased during 2009, compared with 2008, due primarily to significantly warmer weather in November 2009, compared with 2008. In addition, during the first quarter of 2009, compared with the first quarter 2008, we experienced fewer incremental sales from inventory beyond our normal baseload due to warmer than normal temperatures. 52 Table of Contents Natural gas volumes marketed decreased during 2008, compared with 2007, due to increased injections in the third quarter of 2008. In addition, demand for natural gas was impacted by weather related events in the third quarter of 2008, including warmer weather and demand disruption caused by Hurricane Ike. Contingencies Legal Proceedings We are a party to various litigation matters and claims that are normal in the course of our operations. While the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Additional information about our legal proceedings is included under Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Annual Report. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES General Part of our strategy is to grow through internally generated growth projects and acquisitions that strengthen and complement our existing assets. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners have relied primarily on operating cash flow, commercial paper, bank credit facilities, debt issuances and or the sale of equity for their liquidity and capital resource requirements. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners fund their operating expenses, debt service, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders primarily with operating cash flow. We expect to continue to use these sources for liquidity and capital resource needs on both a short and long term basis. Neither ONEOK or ONEOK Partners guarantees the debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated parties, and ONEOK does not guarantee the debt or other similar commitments of ONEOK Partners. During 2009, the capital markets improved significantly from year end 2008. Throughout 2009 and continuing in 2010, ONEOK had access to the commercial paper markets to meet its short term funding needs, and continued to have access to the ONEOK Credit Agreement which expires in July 2011. ONEOK Partners continued to have access to the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, which was adequate to fund its short term liquidity needs and expires in March 2012. ONEOK Partners was able to access the public debt and equity markets to meet its long term financing needs for 2009. We expect a moderate economic recovery in 2010, with inflationary pressures beginning in 2011. Although recent volatility in the financial markets could limit our access to financial markets or increase our cost of capital in the future, we anticipate improved credit markets during 2010, compared with 2009. ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners ability to continue to access capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on our and ONEOK Partners respective financial condition and credit ratings, and market conditions. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners anticipate that cash flow generated from operations, existing capital resources and ability to obtain financing will enable both to maintain current levels of operations and planned operations, collateral requirements and capital expenditures. Capitalization Structure The following table sets forth our capitalization structure for the periods indicated: December 31, December 31, 2009 2008 Long term debt 57% 67% Equity 43% 33% Debt (including notes payable) 61% 76% Equity 39% 24% For purposes of determining compliance with financial covenants in the ONEOK Credit Agreement, which are described below, the debt of ONEOK Partners is excluded. The following table sets forth ONEOKs capitalization structure, excluding the debt of ONEOK Partners, for the periods indicated: December 31, December 31, 2009 2008 Long term debt 41% 44% Equity 59% 56% Debt (including notes payable) 46% 59% Equity 54% 41% 53 Table of Contents In February 2009, ONEOK repaid $100 million of maturing long term debt with cash from operations and short term borrowings. Cash Management ONEOK and ONEOK Partners each use similar centralized cash management programs that concentrate the cash assets of their operating subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing, transaction costs and bank fees. Both centralized cash management programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of the operating subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the respective consolidated groups. ONEOK Partners operating subsidiaries participate in these programs to the extent they are permitted pursuant to FERC regulations or their operating agreements. Under these cash management programs, depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short term cash surpluses or cash requirements, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners provide cash to their respective subsidiaries or the subsidiaries provide cash to them. Short term Liquidity ONEOKs principal sources of short term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities, quarterly distributions from ONEOK Partners and the ONEOK Credit Agreement as discussed below. ONEOK also has a commercial paper program that can be utilized for short term liquidity needs, and to the extent commercial paper is unavailable, the ONEOK Credit Agreement may be utilized. ONEOK Partners principal sources of short term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. The total amount of short term borrowings authorized by ONEOKs Board of Directors is $2.5 billion. At December 31, 2009, ONEOK had $358.9 million commercial paper outstanding, $37.0 million letters of credit issued under the ONEOK Credit Agreement and available cash and cash equivalents of approximately $26.2 million. ONEOK had $804.1 million of credit available at December 31, 2009, under the ONEOK Credit Agreement. The amount of credit available under committed bank lines decreased by $400 million when ONEOKs 364 day revolving credit facility dated August 6, 2008, expired on August 5, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, ONEOK could have issued $2.9 billion of additional short and long term debt under the most restrictive provisions contained in its various borrowing agreements. The total amount of short term borrowings authorized by the Board of Directors of ONEOK Partners GP, the general partner of ONEOK Partners, is $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2009, ONEOK Partners had $523 million in borrowings outstanding under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and available cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.2 million. As of December 31, 2009, ONEOK Partners borrowing capacity was limited to $367.1 million of additional short and long term debt under the most restrictive provisions of the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2009, ONEOK Partners had a total of $24.2 million in letters of credit issued outside the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. The ONEOK Credit Agreement contains certain financial, operational and legal covenants. These requirements include, among others: a $400 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit; a limitation on ONEOKs stand alone debt to capital ratio, which may not exceed 67.5 percent at the end of any calendar quarter; a requirement that ONEOK maintains the power to control the management and policies of ONEOK Partners, a limit on new investments in master limited partnerships; and other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants relating to liens, investments, fundamental changes in ONEOKs businesses, changes in the nature of ONEOKs businesses, transactions with affiliates, the use of proceeds and a covenant that prevents ONEOK from restricting its subsidiaries ability to pay dividends. The debt covenant calculations in the ONEOK Credit Agreement exclude the debt of ONEOK Partners. Upon breach of any covenant by ONEOK, amounts outstanding under the ONEOK Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2009, ONEOKs stand alone debt to capital ratio, as defined by the ONEOK Credit Agreement, was 45.4 percent, and ONEOK was in compliance with all covenants under the ONEOK Credit Agreement. Under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, ONEOK Partners is required to comply with certain financial, operational and legal covenants. Among other things, these requirements include maintaining a ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA, as defined in ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, as adjusted for all non cash charges and increased for projected EBITDA from certain lender approved capital expansion projects) of no more than 5 to 1. If ONEOK Partners consummates one or more acquisitions in which the aggregate purchase price is $25 million or more, the allowable ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA will be increased to 5.5 to 1 for the three calendar quarters following the acquisition. Upon any breach of any covenant by ONEOK Partners in its ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2009, ONEOK 54 Table of Contents Partners ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA was 4.5 to 1, and ONEOK Partners was in compliance with all covenants under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2009, the average interest rate on ONEOK and ONEOK Partners short term debt outstanding was 0.3 percent and 0.54 percent, respectively, and the weighted average for the year ended December 31, 2009, was 1.26 percent and 2.13 percent, respectively. Based on the forward LIBOR curve, we expect the interest rates on ONEOK and ONEOK Partners short term borrowings to increase in 2010, compared with interest rates on amounts outstanding at December 31, 2009. Long term Financing In addition to the principal sources of short term liquidity discussed above, options available to ONEOK to meet its longer term cash requirements include the issuance of equity, issuance of long term notes, issuance of convertible debt securities, asset securitization and the sale and leaseback of facilities. Options available to ONEOK Partners to meet its longer term cash requirements include the issuance of common units, issuance of long term notes, issuance of convertible debt securities, and asset securitization and sale and leaseback of facilities. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners are subject to changes in the debt and equity markets, and there is no assurance they will be able or willing to access the public or private markets in the future. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners may choose to meet their cash requirements by utilizing some combination of cash flows from operations, borrowing under existing credit facilities, altering the timing of controllable expenditures, restricting future acquisitions and capital projects, or pursuing other debt or equity financing alternatives. Some of these alternatives could involve higher costs or negatively affect their respective credit ratings, among other factors. Based on ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners investment grade credit ratings, general financial condition and market expectations regarding their future earnings and projected cash flows, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners believe that they will be able to meet their respective cash requirements and maintain their investment grade credit ratings. ONEOK Partners Equity Issuances In July 2009, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of 5,486,690 common units, including the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option, at $45.81 per common unit, generating net proceeds of approximately $241.6 million. In conjunction with the offering, ONEOK Partners GP contributed an aggregate of $5.1 million to ONEOK Partners in order to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest. ONEOK Partners used the proceeds from the sale of common units and the general partner contributions to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and for general partnership purposes. As a result of these transactions, our interest in ONEOK Partners was 45.1 percent. In February 2010, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of 5,500,900 common units, including the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option, at $60.75 per common unit, generating net proceeds of approximately $322.6 million. In conjunction with the offering, ONEOK Partners GP contributed $6.8 million in order to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest. ONEOK Partners used the proceeds from the sale of common units and the general partner contribution to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and for general partnership purposes. As a result of these transactions, we hold a 42.8 percent aggregate equity interest in ONEOK Partners. ONEOK Partners Debt Issuance In March 2009, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625 percent Senior Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes). ONEOK Partners used the net proceeds of approximately $494.3 million from the offering to repay indebtedness outstanding under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. For more information regarding the 2019 Notes, refer to discussion in Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. Debt Covenants The terms of the 2019 Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of September 25, 2006, between ONEOK Partners and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, as supplemented by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated March 3, 2009 (Indenture). The Indentures does not limit the aggregate principal amount of debt securities that may be issued and provides that debt securities may be issued from time to time in one or more additional series. The Indenture contains covenants including, among other provisions, limitations on ONEOK Partners ability to place liens on its property or assets and to sell and lease back its property. ONEOK Partners $250 million and $225 million senior notes, due June 15, 2010, and March 15, 2011, respectively, contain provisions that require ONEOK Partners to offer to repurchase the senior notes at par value if its Moodys or S&P credit rating falls below investment grade (Baa3 for Moodys or BBB for S&P) and the investment grade rating is not reinstated within a period of 40 days; however, once the $250 million 2010 senior notes have been retired, whether by maturity, redemption or otherwise, ONEOK Partners will no longer have any obligation to offer to repurchase the $225 million 2011 senior notes in the event its credit rating falls below investment grade. Further, the indentures governing ONEOK Partners senior notes due 2010 and 2011 include an event of default upon acceleration of other indebtedness of $25 million or more 55 Table of Contents and the indentures governing the senior notes due 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037 include an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of $100 million or more that would be triggered by such an offer to repurchase. Such an event of default would entitle the trustee or the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior notes due 2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037 to declare those notes immediately due and payable in full. ONEOK Partners may redeem the notes due 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037, in whole or in part, at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make whole premium. The redemption price will never be less than 100 percent of the principal amount of the respective note plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The notes due 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037 are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with all of ONEOK Partners existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, and effectively junior to all of the existing and future debt and other liabilities of any non guarantor subsidiaries, and are nonrecourse to ONEOK. Capital Expenditures ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners capital expenditures are typically financed through operating cash flows, short and long term debt and the issuance of equity. Total capital expenditures were $791.2 million, $1,473.1 million and $883.7 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, exclusive of acquisitions. Of these amounts, ONEOK Partners capital expenditures were $615.7 million, $1,253.9 million and $709.9 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, exclusive of acquisitions. Our capital expenditures are driven primarily by ONEOK Partners capital projects discussed beginning on page 38. Capital expenditures in 2009 were significantly less than 2008 capital expenditures, due primarily to the completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline, the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects, the Williston Basin gas processing plant expansion and the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension. The following table sets forth our 2010 projected capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC: 2010 Projected Capital Expenditures (Millions of dollars) ONEOK Partners $ 362 Distribution 217 Other 24 Total projected capital expenditures $ 603 Investment in Northern Border Pipeline During 2009, ONEOK Partners made equity contributions of $42.3 million to Northern Border. ONEOK Partners does not anticipate making any material equity contributions in 2010. Overland Pass Pipeline Company A subsidiary of ONEOK Partners owns 99 percent of Overland Pass Pipeline Company and operates the pipeline. On or before November 17, 2010, Williams has the option to increase its ownership in Overland Pass Pipeline Company up to a total of 50 percent, with the purchase price being determined in accordance with the joint ventures operating agreement. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2009, are shown in the table below: ONEOK ONEOK Partners Rating Agency Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Moodys Baa2 Stable Baa2 Stable S&P BBB Stable BBB Stable ONEOKs commercial paper is rated P2 by Moodys and A2 by S&P. ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners credit ratings, which are currently investment grade, may be affected by a material change in financial ratios or a material event affecting the business. The most common criteria for assessment of credit ratings are the debt to capital ratio, business risk profile, pretax and after tax interest coverage, and liquidity. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners do not currently anticipate their respective credit ratings to be downgraded. However, if our credit ratings were downgraded, the interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under the ONEOK Credit Agreement would increase, and we could potentially lose access to the commercial paper market. Likewise, ONEOK Partners would see increased borrowing costs under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. In the event that ONEOK is unable to borrow funds under its commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in its business, ONEOK would continue to have access to the ONEOK Credit Agreement, which expires in July 2011. An adverse rating change alone is not a default under the ONEOK Credit Agreement or the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement but could trigger repurchase obligations with respect to certain ONEOK Partners long term debt. See additional discussion about our credit ratings under Debt Covenants. 56 Table of Contents If ONEOK Partners repurchase obligations are triggered, it may not have sufficient cash on hand to repurchase and repay any accelerated senior notes, which may cause it to borrow money under its credit facilities, seek alternative financing sources or sell assets to finance the repurchases and repayment. ONEOK Partners could also face difficulties accessing capital or its borrowing costs could increase, impacting its ability to obtain financing for acquisitions or capital expenditures, to refinance indebtedness and to fulfill its debt obligations. Our Energy Services segment relies upon the investment grade rating of ONEOKs senior unsecured long term debt to reduce its collateral requirements. If ONEOKs credit ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to participate in energy marketing and trading activities could be significantly limited. Without an investment grade rating, we may be required to fund margin requirements with our counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments. At December 31, 2009, we could have been required to fund approximately $26.9 million in margin requirements related to financial contracts upon such a downgrade. A decline in ONEOKs credit rating below investment grade may also significantly impact other business segments. Other than ONEOK Partners note repurchase obligations and the margin requirements for our Energy Services segment described above, we have determined that we do not have significant exposure to rating triggers under ONEOKs trust indentures, building leases, equipment leases and other various contracts. Rating triggers are defined as provisions that would create an automatic default or acceleration of indebtedness based on a change in our credit rating. In the normal course of business, ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners counterparties provide secured and unsecured credit. In the event of a downgrade in ONEOKs or ONEOK Partners credit ratings or a significant change in ONEOKs or ONEOK Partners counterparties evaluation of our creditworthiness, ONEOK or ONEOK Partners could be required to provide additional collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments as a condition of continuing to conduct business with such counterparties. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price volatility. Significant fluctuations in commodity prices may impact our overall liquidity due to the impact commodity price changes have on our cash flows from operating activities, including the impact on working capital for NGLs and natural gas held in storage, margin requirements and certain energy related receivables. We believe that ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners available credit and cash and cash equivalents are adequate to meet liquidity requirements associated with commodity price volatility. See discussion beginning on page 62 under Commodity Price Risk in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, for information on our hedging activities. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans Information about our pension and postretirement benefits plans, including anticipated contributions, is included under Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. General market factors in 2009 negatively impacted the funded status of our plan, and as a result, we made contributions to our pension plans of $77.3 million during 2009. We do not expect that our funding requirements in 2010 will have a material impact on our liquidity. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Information about our environmental matters is included in Environmental and Safety Matters of Item 1, Business and Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. We cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our expenditures for environmental evaluation, mitigation, remediation and compliance to date have not been significant in relation to our financial position or results of operations, and our expenditures related to environmental matters had no material effects upon earnings or cash flows during 2009, 2008 and 2007. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS We use the indirect method to prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period. These reconciling items include depreciation and amortization, allowance for equity funds used during construction, gain on sale of assets, equity earnings from investments, distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates, deferred income taxes, stock based compensation expense, allowance for doubtful accounts, and changes in our assets and liabilities not classified as investing or financing activities. 57 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the changes in cash flows by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 2009 2008 2007 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,452.7 $ 475.7 $ 1,029.6 $ 977.0 * $ (553.9 ) (54 %) Investing activities (787.8 ) (1,454.3 ) (1,151.8 ) 666.5 46 % (302.5 ) (26 %) Financing activities (1,145.6 ) 1,469.6 73.0 (2,615.2 ) * 1,396.6 * Change in cash and cash equivalents (480.7 ) 491.0 (49.2 ) (971.7 ) * 540.2 * Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 510.1 19.1 68.3 491.0 * (49.2 ) (72 %) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 29.4 $ 510.1 $ 19.1 $ (480.7 ) (94 %) $ 491.0 * * Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. Operating Cash Flows Operating cash flows are affected by earnings from our business activities. We provide services to producers and consumers of natural gas, condensate and NGLs. Changes in commodity prices and demand for our services or products, whether because of general economic conditions, changes in demand for the end products that are made with our products or increased competition from other service providers, could affect our earnings and operating cash flows. 2009 vs. 2008 Cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $974.3 million for 2009, compared with $991.0 million for 2008. The decrease was due primarily to lower realized commodity prices and narrower NGL product price differentials in our ONEOK Partners segment, offset partially by increased NGL volumes gathered, fractionated and transported, primarily associated with the completion of the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects, and the Arbuckle Pipeline, as well as new NGL supply connections in our ONEOK Partners segment, and increased transportation margins, net of hedging activities, in our Energy Services segment. The changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows $478.4 million for 2009, compared with a decrease of $515.3 million for 2008, primarily as a result of the following: a decrease in cash collateral and margin requirements in our Energy Services segment; the impact of commodity prices on our operating assets and liabilities; and the timing of cash receipts from our revenues resulting in increased accounts receivable; offset partially by the timing of payments for purchases of commodities and other expenses resulting in increased accounts payable. 2008 vs. 2007 Cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $991.0 million for 2008, compared with $826.0 million for 2007. The increase was due primarily to higher realized commodity prices and wider NGL product price differentials in our ONEOK Partners segment and implementation of new rate mechanisms in our Distribution segment. The changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows $515.3 million for 2008, compared with an increase of $203.6 million for 2007, primarily as a result of the following: the timing of cash receipts from our revenues resulting in decreased accounts receivable; the timing of payments for purchases of commodities and other expenses resulting in decreased accounts payable; and the changes in volumes of commodities in storage. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities decreased for 2009, compared with 2008, due primarily to reduced capital expenditures as a result of the completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline and Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects, the Williston Basin gas processing plant expansion and the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension in our ONEOK Partners segment. Cash used in investing activities increased for 2008, compared with 2007, due primarily to increased spending for our capital projects. Financing Cash Flows Net repayments of notes payable were $1.4 billion during 2009, compared with net borrowings of $2.1 billion for 2008 and net borrowings of $196.6 million for 2007. Due to volatility in the credit markets in late 2008, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners borrowed under their available credit facilities to fund their respective working capital requirements in late 2008 and the first part of 2009. 58 Table of Contents During 2009, ONEOK Partners completed a public offering of common units generating net proceeds of approximately $241.6 million. ONEOK Partners used the proceeds to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and for general partnership purposes. During 2008, ONEOK Partners public sale of 2.6 million common units generated net proceeds of approximately $147.0 million. ONEOK Partners used a portion of the proceeds to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. In March 2009, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of senior notes and received proceeds totaling approximately $498.3 million, net of discounts but before offering expenses. ONEOK Partners used the net proceeds from the notes to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. In 2007, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of senior notes and received proceeds totaling approximately $598.1 million, net of discounts. ONEOK Partners used the net proceeds from the notes to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and finance the $300 million acquisition of assets, before working capital adjustments, from a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan in October 2007. In February 2009 and 2008, ONEOK repaid $100.0 million and $402.3 million, respectively, of maturing long term debt with available cash and short term borrowings. During 2007, we paid $20.1 million for the settlement of the forward purchase contract related to our stock repurchase in February and approximately $370 million for our stock repurchase in June. Dividends paid were $1.64 per share, $1.56 per share and $1.40 per share for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Distributions paid to limited partners by ONEOK Partners were $4.33 per unit, $4.205 per unit and $3.98 per unit for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table sets forth our contractual obligations related to debt, operating leases and other long term obligations as of December 31, 2009. For additional discussion of the debt and operating lease agreements, see Notes I and L, respectively, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter ONEOK (Thousands of dollars) Commercial paper $ 358,870 $ 358,870 $ $ $ $ $ Long term debt 1,481,009 6,284 406,306 6,329 6,205 6,006 1,049,879 Interest payments on debt 1,008,400 91,400 70,900 62,100 61,700 61,300 661,000 Operating leases 58,865 26,503 31,619 400 167 9 Firm transportation and storage contracts 615,760 144,084 120,629 114,143 84,451 69,526 82,927 Financial and physical derivatives 2,010,986 1,741,033 202,382 66,738 833 Employee benefit plans 55,701 55,701 Other 283 283 $ 5,589,874 $ 2,424,158 $ 831,836 $ 249,710 $ 153,356 $ 136,841 $ 1,793,806 ONEOK Partners $1 billion credit agreement $ 523,000 $ 523,000 $ $ $ $ $ Long term debt 3,084,780 261,931 236,931 361,062 7,650 7,650 2,209,556 Interest payments on debt 2,984,200 215,500 191,700 172,000 166,100 164,600 2,074,300 Operating leases 14,325 3,459 2,595 2,418 2,327 1,936 1,590 Firm transportation and storage contracts 14,757 6,760 1,388 1,388 1,388 1,205 2,628 Financial and physical derivatives 196,027 196,027 Purchase commitments, rights of way and other 5,610 935 935 935 935 935 935 $ 6,822,699 $ 1,207,612 $ 433,549 $ 537,803 $ 178,400 $ 176,326 $ 4,289,009 Total $ 12,412,573 $ 3,631,770 $ 1,265,385 $ 787,513 $ 331,756 $ 313,167 $ 6,082,815 Long term Debt Long term debt as reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets includes unamortized debt discount and the mark to market effect of interest rate swaps. 59 Table of Contents Interest Payments on Debt Interest expense is calculated by multiplying long term debt by the respective coupon rates, adjusted for active swaps. Operating Leases Our operating leases include a natural gas processing plant, office space, pipeline equipment, rights of way and vehicles. Operating lease obligations for ONEOK Partners exclude intercompany payments related to the lease of a gas processing plant. Firm Transportation and Storage Contracts We are party to fixed price contracts for firm transportation and storage capacity. However, the costs associated with our Distribution segments contracts are recovered through rates as allowed by the applicable regulatory agency and are excluded from the table above. Financial and Physical Derivatives These are obligations arising from our fixed and variable price purchase commitments for financial and physical commodity derivatives. However, the commitments associated with our Distribution segments contracts are recovered through rates as allowed by the applicable regulatory agency and are excluded from the table above. Estimated future variable price purchase commitments are based on market information at December 31, 2009. Actual future variable price purchase commitments may vary depending on market prices at the time of delivery. Not included in these amounts are offsetting cash inflows from our ONEOK Partners and Energy Services segments product sales and net positive settlements. As market information changes daily and is potentially volatile, these values may change significantly. Additionally, product sales may require additional purchase obligations to fulfill sales obligations that are not reflected in these amounts. Employee Benefit Plans Employee benefit plans include our anticipated contribution to maintain the minimum required funding level to our pension and postretirement benefit plans for 2010. See Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for discussion of our employee benefit plans. Purchase Commitments Purchase commitments include commitments related to ONEOK Partners growth capital expenditures and other rights of way commitments. Purchase commitments exclude commodity purchase contracts, which are included in the Financial and physical derivatives amounts. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the statements contained and incorporated in this Annual Report are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934. The forward looking statements relate to our anticipated financial performance, managements plans and objectives for our future operations, our business prospects, the outcome of regulatory and legal proceedings, market conditions and other matters. We make these forward looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following discussion is intended to identify important factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, the information concerning possible or assumed future results of our operations and other statements contained or incorporated in this Annual Report identified by words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, plan, believe, should, goal, forecast, guidance, could, may, continue, might, potential, scheduled, and other words and terms of similar meaning. One should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which are applicable only as of the date of this Annual Report. Known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by forward looking statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Policy and Oversight We control the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibilities for our risk management limits and policies. Our risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price and credit risk management, and marketing and trading activities. The committee also monitors risk metrics including value at risk (VAR) and mark to market losses. We have a risk control group that is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies and procedures and monitoring certain risk metrics. Key risk control activities include risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics. Our exposure to market risk discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity prices. Our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in interest rates or commodity prices and the timing of transactions. COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to commodity price risk and the impact of market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. Commodity price risk refers to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in energy prices. To minimize the risk from market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, we use commodity derivative instruments such as futures, physical forward contracts, swaps and options to manage commodity price risk associated with existing or anticipated purchase and sale agreements, existing physical natural gas in storage and basis risk. ONEOK Partners ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of receiving commodities in exchange for its gathering and processing services. To a lesser extent, ONEOK Partners is exposed to the relative price differential between NGLs and natural gas, or the gross processing spread, with respect to its keep whole processing contracts. ONEOK Partners is also exposed to the risk of price fluctuations and the cost of transportation at various market locations. As part of ONEOK Partners hedging strategy, ONEOK Partners uses commodity fixed price physical forwards and derivative contracts, including NYMEX based futures and over the counter swaps, to minimize earnings volatility in its natural gas gathering and processing business related to natural gas, NGL and condensate price fluctuations. ONEOK Partners reduces its gross processing spread exposure through a combination of physical and financial hedges. ONEOK Partners utilizes a portion of its percent of proceeds equity natural gas as an offset, or natural hedge, to an equivalent portion of its keep whole shrink requirements. This has the effect of converting ONEOK Partners gross processing spread risk to NGL commodity price risk, and ONEOK Partners then uses financial instruments to hedge the sale of NGLs. 62 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009, ONEOK Partners had $0.5 million of derivative assets and $18.8 million of derivative liabilities, excluding the impact of netting, all of which related to commodity contracts. The following tables set forth ONEOK Partners hedging information for the periods indicated, as of February 22, 2010: Year Ending December 31, 2010 Volumes Hedged Average Price Percentage Hedged NGLs (Bbl/d) (a) 5,304 $1.03 / gallon 75% Condensate (Bbl/d) (a) 1,696 $1.80 / gallon 75% Total (Bbl/d) 7,000 $1.21 / gallon 75% Natural gas (MMBtu/d) 25,225 $5.55 / MMBtu 75% (a) Hedged with fixed price swaps. Year Ending December 31, 2011 Volumes Hedged Average Price Percentage Hedged NGLs (Bbl/d) (a) 902 $1.34 / gallon 13% Condensate (Bbl/d) (a) 596 $2.12 / gallon 25% Total (Bbl/d) 1,498 $1.65 / gallon 16% Natural gas (MMBtu/d) 16,616 $6.29 / MMBtu 43% (a) Hedged with fixed price swaps. ONEOK Partners commodity price risk is estimated as a hypothetical change in the price of NGLs, crude oil and natural gas at December 31, 2009, excluding the effects of hedging and assuming normal operating conditions. ONEOK Partners condensate sales are based on the price of crude oil. ONEOK Partners estimates the following: a $0.01 per gallon decrease in the composite price of NGLs would decrease annual net margin by approximately $1.0 million; a $1.00 per barrel decrease in the price of crude oil would decrease annual net margin by approximately $1.1 million; and a $0.10 per MMBtu decrease in the price of natural gas would decrease annual net margin by approximately $1.2 million. ONEOK Partners is also exposed to commodity price risk primarily as a result of NGLs in storage, the relative values of the various NGL products to each other, the relative value of NGLs to natural gas and the relative value of NGL purchases at one location and sales at another location, known as basis risk. ONEOK Partners utilizes fixed price physical forward contracts to reduce earnings volatility related to NGL price fluctuations. ONEOK Partners has not entered into any financial instruments with respect to its NGL marketing activities. In addition, ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk as its natural gas interstate and intrastate pipelines collect natural gas from its customers for operations or as part of its fee for services provided. When the amount of natural gas consumed in operations by these pipelines differs from the amount provided by its customers, the pipelines must buy or sell natural gas, or store or use natural gas from inventory, which exposes ONEOK Partners to commodity price risk. At December 31, 2009, there were no hedges in place with respect to natural gas price risk from ONEOK Partners natural gas pipeline business. Distribution Our Distribution segment uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of anticipated natural gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect their customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural gas. Gains or losses associated with these derivative instruments are included in, and recoverable through, the monthly purchased gas cost adjustment mechanism. Energy Services Our Energy Services segment is exposed to commodity price risk, basis risk and price volatility arising from natural gas in storage, requirement contracts, asset management contracts and index based purchases and sales of natural gas at various market locations. We minimize the volatility of our exposure to commodity price risk through the use of derivative instruments, which, under certain circumstances, are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. We are also exposed to 63 Table of Contents commodity price risk from fixed price purchases and sales of natural gas, which we hedge with derivative instruments. Both the fixed price purchases and sales and related derivatives are recorded at fair value. Fair Value Component of the Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities The following table sets forth the fair value component of the energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities, excluding $161.5 million and $21.0 million of net assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, from derivative instruments declared as either fair value or cash flow hedges for the periods indicated: Fair Value Component of Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities (Thousands of dollars) Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at January 1, 2008 $ 25,171 Derivatives reclassified or otherwise settled during the period (55,874 ) Fair value of new derivatives entered into during the period (a) (18,372 ) Other changes in fair value 52,731 Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2008 (a) 3,656 Derivatives reclassified or otherwise settled during the period (15,112 ) Fair value of new derivatives entered into during the period 3,481 Other changes in fair value 10,700 Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2009 (b) $ 2,725 (a) This balance has been adjusted by $255.1 million from the amount reported in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008. The adjustment was made in order to exclude from this table the gains on cash flow hedges that were reclassified into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the write down of our natural gas in storage to its lower of weighted average cost or market. (b) The maturities of derivatives are based on injection and withdrawal periods from April through March, which is consistent with our business strategy. The maturities are as follows: $(1.8) million matures through March 2010, $4.2 million matures through March 2011 and $0.3 million matures through March 2015. The change in the net fair value of derivatives outstanding includes the effect of settled energy contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of market movements on the fair value of energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities. For further discussion of fair value measurements and trading activities and assumptions used in our trading activities, see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Also, see Notes C and D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. VAR Disclosure of Commodity Price Risk The potential impact on our future earnings, as measured by VAR, was $5.4 million and $7.9 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following table sets forth the average, high and low VAR calculations for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, Value at Risk 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Average $ 8.0 $ 12.3 High $ 14.1 $ 24.9 Low $ 4.6 $ 4.0 Our VAR calculation includes derivatives, executory storage and transportation agreements and their related hedges. The variations in the VAR data are reflective of market volatility and changes in our portfolio during the year. The decrease in average VAR for 2009, compared with 2008, was due primarily to price fluctuations between various locations and a decrease in the overall position of our portfolio in 2009. Our VAR calculation uses historical prices, placing more emphasis on the most recent price movements. We calculate the VAR on our mark to market derivative positions, which reflects the risk associated with derivatives whose change in fair value will impact current period earnings. VAR associated with these derivative positions was not material during 2009 or 2008. To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably. As a result, we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position. 64 Table of Contents INTEREST RATE RISK General We are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the normal course of business. We manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates. At December 31, 2009, the interest rate on all of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners long term debt was fixed. Fair Value Hedges At December 31, 2009, we were not using any interest rate swaps. See Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for discussion of the impact of interest rate swaps and net interest expense savings from terminated swaps. Total net swap savings for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $10.6 million, $17.4 million and $8.2 million, respectively. Total swap savings for 2010 are expected to be $10.2 million. CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK As a result of our Energy Services segments operations in Canada, we are exposed to currency exchange rate risk from our commodity purchases and sales related to our firm transportation and storage contracts. To reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, we use physical forward transactions, which result in an actual two way flow of currency on the settlement date since we exchange U.S. dollars for Canadian dollars with another party. We have not designated these transactions for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, the gains and losses associated with the change in fair value are recorded in net margin. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our exposure to risk from currency transactions gains and losses was not material. The currency transaction gain recognized during 2009 was immaterial. We recognized a currency transaction loss of $3.1 million and a currency transaction gain of $4.1 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively. COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK ONEOK and ONEOK Partners assess the creditworthiness of their counterparties on an ongoing basis and require security, including prepayments and other forms of collateral, when appropriate. 65 Table of Contents
