ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS The following discussion highlights some of our planned activities, recent achievements and significant issues affecting us. Please refer to the Financial Results and Operating Information, and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and our consolidated financial statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. ONEOK Partners Growth Projects ONEOK Partners has announced in 2010 and early 2011 approximately $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion in growth projects, primarily in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and the Cana Woodford Shale and Granite Wash areas in Oklahoma and Texas, that will enable ONEOK Partners to meet the rapidly growing needs of crude oil and natural gas producers as they increase their drilling activities. Williston Basin Projects Drilling rig counts in Dunn, McKenzie and Williams counties in North Dakota have increased dramatically since the beginning of 2010. The development of the reserves in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations in the Williston Basin are being driven primarily by crude oil economics, with the associated natural gas production having a high NGL content. Current natural gas processing and natural gas liquids infrastructure in the Williston Basin is being expanded to accommodate the additional production from the increased development activities. ONEOK Partners is the largest independent gatherer and processor of natural gas in the Williston Basin. With its natural gas gathering and processing business existing infrastructure and acreage dedications, ONEOK Partners is well positioned to provide critical midstream services to crude oil and natural gas producers as they develop Bakken Shale and Three Forks reserves. Additional natural gas liquids infrastructure is also needed due to the continued NGL production growth that has saturated the areas current truck and railcar transportation capacity and market. The following provides additional details about the individual projects: Williston Basin Processing Plants and related projects ONEOK Partners announced plans to construct three new 100 MMcf/d natural gas processing facilities, the Garden Creek plant in eastern McKenzie County, North Dakota, and the Stateline I and II plants in western Williams County, North Dakota. In addition, ONEOK Partners plans to make investments in related natural gas liquids infrastructure, expansions and upgrades to its existing gathering and compression infrastructure and new well connections associated with these plants. The Garden Creek plant and related projects are expected to be in service by the end of 2011 and cost approximately $350 million to $415 million, excluding AFUDC. The S tateline I plant, which is expected to be in service during the third quarter of 2012, and related projects are expected to cost approximately $300 million to $355 million, excluding AFUDC. The Stateline II plant, which is expected to be in service during the first half of 2013, and related projects are expected to cost approximately $260 million to $305 million, excluding AFUDC. These projects are in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business. Bakken Pipeline and related projects ONEOK Partners announced plans to build a 525 to 615 mile natural gas liquids pipeline, the Bakken Pipeline, that will transport unfractionated NGLs from the Williston Basin in North Dakota to the Overland Pass Pipeline. The Bakken Pipeline will have capacity to transport initially up to 60 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGL production from ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing assets in the Williston Basin originating in eastern Montana and connecting to the Overland Pass Pipeline in northeastern Colorado. The unfractionated NGLs will then be delivered to ONEOK Partners existing natural gas liquids fractionation and distribution infrastructure in the Mid Continent. Additional pump facilit ies could increase the Bakken Pipelines capacity to 110 MBbl/d. Supply commitments for the Bakken Pipeline will be anchored by NGL production from ONEOK Partners natural gas processing plants. ONEOK Partners is also discussing NGL supply commitments with third party processors. Following receipt of all necessary permits, construction of the 12 inch diameter pipeline is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2012 and be in service during the first half of 2013. Project costs for the new pipeline are estimated to be $450 million to $550 million, excluding AFUDC. The unfractionated NGLs from the Bakken Pipeline and other supply sources under development in the Rockies will require additional pump stations and the expansion of existing pump stations on the Overland Pass Pipeline. These additions and expansions will increase the capacity of Overland Pass Pipeline to 255 MBbl/d. ONEOK Partners anticipated share of the costs for this project is estimated to be $35 million to $40 million, excluding AFUDC. The Bakken Pipeline and related projects are in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business. 36 Table of Contents Bushton Fractionator Expansion To accommodate the additional volume from the Bakken Pipeline, ONEOK Partners will invest $110 million to $140 million, excluding AFUDC, to expand and upgrade its existing fractionation capacity at Bushton, Kansas, increasing its capacity to 210 MBbl/d from 150 MBbl/d. This project is expected to be in service during the first half of 2013 and is in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business. Cana Woodford Shale and Granite Wash projects In addition to the growth projects in the Williston Basin, ONEOK Partners has also announced plans to invest approximately $270 million to $330 million, excluding AFUDC, in its existing Mid Continent infrastructure, primarily in the Cana Woodford Shale and Granite Wash areas. The expansions and upgrades will increase ONEOK Partners ability to accommodate the growing natural gas and NGL supply from producers and natural gas processors as drilling activities increase in these areas. These investments will expand its ability to transport unfractionated NGLs from these supply areas to fractionation facilities in Oklahoma and Texas and distribute purity NGL products to the Mid Continent, Gulf Coast and u pper Midwest market centers. A portion of these investments will also allow ONEOK Partners to increase utilization in its natural gas processing capacity in Oklahoma. ONEOK Partners also announced plans to construct more than 230 miles of natural gas liquids pipeline that will expand its existing Mid Continent natural gas liquids gathering system in the Cana Woodford Shale and Granite Wash areas. The pipeline will connect to three new third party natural gas processing facilities that are under construction and to three existing third party natural gas processing facilities that are being expanded. Additionally, ONEOK Partners will install additional pump stations on the Arbuckle Pipeline to increase its capacity to 240 MBbl/d. When completed, these projects are expected to add approximately 75 to 80 MBbl/d of raw, unfractionated NGLs to ONEOK Partners existing natural gas liquids gathering systems. These projects are expected to be in service during t he first half of 2012 and cost approximately $180 million to $240 million, excluding AFUDC. These projects are in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business. ONEOK Partners will invest an additional $55 million in the Cana Woodford Shale development in Oklahoma. The investments include approximately $20 million for new well connections in 2010 and 2011 to gather additional Cana Woodford Shale natural gas volumes. In addition, ONEOK Partners completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 the connection of its Western Oklahoma natural gas gathering system to its existing Maysville natural gas processing facility in central Oklahoma and the connection of a new natural gas processing plant to its natural gas liquids gathering system. These projects are in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids businesses, respectively. Sterling I Pipeline Expansion ONEOK Partners will install seven additional pump stations for approximately $36 million, excluding AFUDC, along its existing Sterling I natural gas liquids distribution pipeline, increasing its capacity by 15 MBbl/d, which will be supplied by ONEOK Partners Mid Continent natural gas liquids infrastructure. The Sterling I pipeline transports NGL purity products from ONEOK Partners fractionator in Medford, Oklahoma, to the Mont Belvieu, Texas, market center and is currently operating at capacity. The pump stations are expected to be in service in the second half of 2011. This project is in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business. For a discussion of capital expenditure financing, see Capital Expenditures in Liquidity and Capital Resources beginning on page 55. Stock Repurchase Program In October 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a three year stock repurchase program to buy up to $750 million of our outstanding common stock, subject to the limitation that purchases will not exceed $300 million in any one calendar year. If shares are repurchased, they will be acquired from time to time in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. Any purchases will be funded by our available cash, free cash flow and short term borrowings. The program will terminate upon completion of the repurchase of $750 million of common stock or on December 31, 2013, whichever occurs first. As of February 21, 2011, no shares have been repurc hased under the program. Overland Pass Pipeline Company In September 2010, ONEOK Partners completed a transaction to sell a 49 percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company to a subsidiary of Williams Partners resulting in each joint venture member now owning 50 percent of Overland Pass Pipeline Company. In accordance with the joint venture agreement, ONEOK Partners received approximately $423.7 million in cash at closing. ONEOK Partners used the proceeds from the transaction to repay short term debt and to fund a portion of its recently announced capital projects. A subsidiary of Williams Partners has elected to become the operator of Overland Pass Pipeline Company and is expected to assume the role of operator in the second quarter of 2011. As a result of the transaction, ONEOK Partners no longer controls Overland Pass Pipeline Company and began accounting for the investment under the equity method of accounting in September 2010. In connection with the deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline Company, ONEOK Partners recognized a gain of approximately $16.3 million. 37 Table of Contents ONEOK Partners Commercial Paper Program In June 2010, ONEOK Partners established a commercial paper program providing for the issuance of up to $1.0 billion of unsecured commercial paper notes. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program reduce the borrowings available under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. In July 2010, ONEOK Partners repaid all borrowings outstanding under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. ONEOK Partners Debt Maturity In June 2010, ONEOK Partners repaid $250 million of maturing senior notes with available cash and short term borrowings. With the repayment of these notes, ONEOK Partners no longer has any obligation to offer to repurchase the $225 million senior notes due March 2011 in the event that ONEOK Partners long term debt credit ratings fall below investment grade. ONEOK Partners Debt Issuance In January 2011, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of $1.3 billion senior notes, consisting of $650 million of 3.25 percent senior notes due 2016 and $650 million of 6.125 percent senior notes due 2041. The net proceeds from the offering of approximately $1.28 billion were used to repay amounts outstanding under ONEOK Partners commercial paper program and for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures, and will be used to repay the $225 million principal amount of senior notes due March 2011. ONEOK Partners Equity Issuance In February 2010, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of 5,500,900 common units, including the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option, at a public offering price of $60.75 per common unit, generating net proceeds of approximately $322.7 million. In conjunction with the offering, ONEOK Partners GP contributed $6.8 million in order to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest. ONEOK Partners used the proceeds from the sale of common units and the general partner contribution to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and for general partnership purposes. Dividends/Distributions During 2010, we paid dividends totaling $1.82 per share, an increase of approximately 11.0 percent over the $1.64 per share paid during 2009. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share ($2.08 per share on an annualized basis) in January 2011, an increase of approximately 18.2 percent over the $0.44 declared in January 2010. During 2010, ONEOK Partners paid cash distributions totaling $4.46 per unit, an increase of approximately 3.0 percent over the $4.33 per unit paid during 2009. A cash distribution from ONEOK Partners of $1.14 per unit ($4.56 per unit on an annualized basis) was declared in January 2011, an increase of approximately 3.6 percent over the $1.10 declared in January 2010. REGULATORY Environmental Liabilities We are subject to multiple historical and wildlife preservation laws and environmental regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations. Regulated activities include those involving air emissions, stormwater and wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, hazardous materials transportation, and pipeline and facility construction. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental clearances, registrations, licenses, permits and other approvals. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines, penalties and or interruptions in our operations that could be material to our results of operations. If a leak or spill of hazardous substances or petroleum products occurs from pipelines or facilities that we own, operate or otherwise use, we could be held jointly and severally liable for all resulting liabilities, including response, investigation and clean up costs, which could affect materially our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, emission controls required under the Clean Air Act and other similar federal and state laws could require unexpected capital expenditures at our facilities. We cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In May 2010, the EPA finalized the Tailoring Rule that will regulate greenhouse gas emissions at new or modified facilities that meet certain criteria. Affected facilities will be required to review best available control technology, conduct air quality analysis, impact analysis and public reviews with respect to such emissions. The rule was phased in beginning January 2011 and, at current emission threshold levels, will have a minimal impact on our existing facilities. The EPA has stated it will consider lowering the threshold levels over the next five years, which could increase the impact on our existing facilities; however, potential costs, fees or expenses associated with the potential adjustments are unknown. In addition, the EPA issued a proposed rule on air quality standards, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines, also known as RICE NESHAP, scheduled to be adopted in 2013. The rule will require capital expenditures over the next three years for the purchase and installation of new emissions control 38 Table of Contents equipment. We do not expect these expenditures to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Financial Markets Legislation In July 2010, the Dodd Frank Act was enacted, representing a far reaching overhaul of the framework for regulation of United States financial markets. Various regulatory agencies, including the SEC and the CFTC, have proposed regulations for implementation of many of the provisions of the Dodd Frank Act and are currently seeking comments on the proposals. We expect additional proposed regulations as the remaining provisions of the Dodd Frank Act are implemented. Until the final regulations are established, we are unable to ascertain how we may be affected. Based on our assessment of the proposed regulations issued to date, we expect to be able to co ntinue to participate in financial markets for hedging certain risks inherent in our business, including commodity and interest rate risks; however, the costs of doing so may increase as a result of the new legislation. We may also incur additional costs associated with our compliance with the new regulations and anticipated additional record keeping, reporting and disclosure obligations. Health Care Legislation In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Health Care Acts) were signed into law. Based on our preliminary analysis of the Health Care Acts, we do not expect a significant impact to our benefit plans or their related costs. We do not participate in the federal retiree prescription drug subsidy program, for which the tax treatment was changed as a result of the Health Care Acts, and accordingly, are not impacted by the change in tax treatment of the subsidy. With the exception of increasing our dependent care age requirement to age 26 from age 24, our health plans provide coverage levels that meet the near term minimum requireme nts outlined in the Health Care Acts. We continue to evaluate the implications of the provisions of the Health Care Acts and expect to continue to provide benefit plan options that meet the provisions outlined by the Health Care Acts. Other Several regulatory initiatives impacted the earnings and future earnings potential for our Distribution segment. See discussion of our Distribution segments regulatory initiatives beginning on page 49. IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Information about the impact of new accounting standards is included in Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. ASU 2010 06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, is a disclosure only standard, which did not have a material impact. See Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our fair value measurements. ESTIMATES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates. The following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies, which are defined as those estimates and policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters. We have discussed the development and selection of our estimates and critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Fair Value Measurements Determining Fair Value We define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We use the market and income approaches to determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities and consider the markets in which the transactions are executed. While many of the contracts in our portfolio are executed in liquid markets where price transparency exists, some contracts are executed in markets for which market prices may exist but the market may be relatively inactive. This results in lim ited price transparency that requires managements judgment and assumptions to estimate fair values. Inputs into our fair value estimates include commodity exchange prices, over the counter quotes, volatility, historical correlations of pricing data and LIBOR and other liquid money market instrument rates. We also utilize internally developed basis curves that incorporate observable and unobservable market data. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources, where available. In addition, as prescribed by the income approach, we compute the fair value of our derivative portfolio by discounting the projected future cash flows 39 Table of Contents from our derivative assets and liabilities to present value. The interest rate yields used to calculate the present value discount factors are derived from LIBOR, Eurodollar futures and Treasury swaps. The projected cash flows are then multiplied by the appropriate discount factors to determine the present value or fair value of our derivative instruments. We also take into consideration the potential impact on market prices of liquidating positions in an orderly manner and over a reasonable period of time using current market conditions. We consider current market data in evaluating counterparties, as well as our own, nonperformance risk by using specific and sector bond yields and also monitor the credit default swap markets, net of collateral. Although we use our best estima tes to determine the fair value of the derivative contracts we have executed, the ultimate market prices realized could differ from our estimates, and the differences could be material. Fair Value Hierarchy At each balance sheet date, we utilize a fair value hierarchy to classify fair value amounts recognized or disclosed in our financial statements based on the observability of inputs used to estimate such fair value. The levels of the hierarchy are described below: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Significant observable pricing inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are, either directly or indirectly, observable as of the reporting date. Essentially, this represents inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data; and Level 3 May include one or more unobservable inputs that are significant in establishing a fair value estimate. These unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available and may include our own internal data. Determining the appropriate classification of our fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy requires managements judgment regarding the degree to which market data is observable or corroborated by observable market data. Transfers in and out of Level 3 typically result from derivatives for which fair value is determined based on multiple inputs. If prices change for a particular input from the previous measurement date to the current measurement date, the impact could result in the derivative being moved between Level 2 and Level 3, depending upon managements judgment of the significance of the price change of that particular input to the total fair value of the derivative. For more information on our fair value measurements, fair value sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. Derivatives, Accounting for Financially Settled Transactions and Risk Management Activities We engage in wholesale energy marketing, retail marketing, trading and risk management activities. We record all derivative instruments at fair value, with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery. Market value changes result in a change in the fair value of our derivative instruments. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effective the hedging instrument is. When possible, we implement effective hedging strategies using derivative instruments that qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. If the derivative instrument does not qualify or is not designated as part of a hedging relationship, then we account for changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings as they occur. Commodity price volatility may have a significant impact on the gain or loss in any given period. To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and condensate prices, we periodically enter into futures, forwards, options or swap transactions in order to hedge anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs and condensate and fuel requirements. Interest rate swaps are also used to manage interest rate risk. Under certain conditions, we designate these derivative instruments as a hedge against our exposure to changes in fair values or cash flow. For hedges of exposure to changes in cash flow, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently recorded to earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness of designated hedge s is reported in earnings during the period the ineffectiveness occurs. However, if a derivative instrument is ineligible for hedge accounting or if the cash flow hedge is not property designated, changes in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recorded currently in earnings. Additionally, if a cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting treatment because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recognized in earnings. For hedges against our exposure in changes in fair value, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings during the period of change together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. We do not believe that changes in our fair value estimates of our derivative instruments have a material impact on our results of operations as the majority of our derivatives are accounted for as hedges for which ineffectiveness is not 40 Table of Contents material. We assess the effectiveness of hedging relationships quarterly by performing an effectiveness test on our hedging relationships to determine whether they are highly effective on a retrospective and prospective basis. Upon election, many of our purchase and sale agreements that otherwise would be required to follow the accounting for derivative instruments qualify as normal purchases and normal sales that result in physical delivery and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment. For more information on our derivatives and risk management activities, fair value sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Note C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion. Impairment of Goodwill and Long Lived Assets, including Intangible Assets We assess our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually as of July 1. There were no impairment charges resulting from our 2010, 2009 or 2008 impairment tests. As part of our impairment test, an initial assessment is made by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use two generally accepted valuation approaches, an income approach and a market approach, using assumptions consistent with a market participants perspective. Under the income approach, we use anticipated cash flows over a period of years plus a terminal value and discount these amounts to their present value using appropriate discount rates. Under the market approach, we apply multiples to forecasted cash flows. The multiples used are consistent with historical asset transactions. The forecasted cash flows are based on average forecasted cash flows over a period of years. Our estimates of fair value significantly exceeded the book value of our reporting units and our indefinite lived intangible assets in our July 1, 2010, impairment test. Even if the estimated fair values used in our July 1, 2010, impairment tests were reduced by 10 percent, no impairment charges would have resulted. The following table sets forth our goodwill, by segment, at both December 31, 2010 and 2009: (Thousands of dollars) ONEOK Partners $ 433,537 Distribution 157,953 Energy Services 10,255 Other 1,099 Total goodwill $ 602,844 As part of our indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test, we compare the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets with their book values. The fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets is estimated using the market approach. Under the market approach, we apply multiples to forecasted cash flows of the assets associated with our indefinite lived intangible assets. The multiples used are consistent with historical asset transactions. We determined that there were no impairments to our indefinite lived intangible assets in 2010, 2009 or 2008. We assess our long lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If an impairment is indicated we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long lived asset. We determined that there were no asset impairments in 2010, 2009 or 2008. For the investments we account for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. Therefore, we periodically re evaluate the amount at which we carry our equity method investments to determine whether current events or circumstances warrant adjustments to our carrying value. We determined that there were no impairments to our investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2010, 2009 or 2008. Our impairment tests require the use of assumptions and estimates such as industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to future impairment charges. 41 Table of Contents See Notes A, D, and E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of goodwill and long lived assets. Pension and Postretirement Employee Benefits We have defined benefit retirement plans covering certain full time employees. We sponsor welfare plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees who retire with at least five years of service. Our actuarial consultant calculates the expense and liability related to these plans and uses statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, age and employment periods. In determining the projected benefit obligations and costs, assumptions can change from period to period and may result in material changes in the costs and liabilities we recognize. See Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional information. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for our health care plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects. One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Thousands of dollars) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 1,835 $ (1,571 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 22,556 $ (19,445 ) During 2010, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $32.6 million related to our defined benefit pension plans and $20.9 million related to postretirement benefits. We estimate that in 2011, we will record net periodic benefit costs of $40.0 million related to our defined benefit pension plans and $19.9 million related to postretirement benefits. In determining our estimated expenses for 2011, we assumed an 8.25 percent expected return on plan assets and a discount rate of 5.5 percent. A decrease in our expected return on plan assets to 8.0 percent would increase our 2011 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $2.3 million for our defined benefit pension plans and would not have a significant impact on our postretirement benefit plans. A decrease in our assumed discount rate to 5.25 percent would increase our 2011 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $3.0 million for our defined benefit pension plans and would not have a significant impact on our postretirement benefit plans. During 2010, we made contributions of $96.8 million and $12.5 million to our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, respectively. These contributions to our defined benefit pension plans included $57.0 million attributable to the 2011 plan year. We anticipate our total 2011 contributions will include an additional $4.3 million for our defined benefit pension plans and $13.9 million for our postretirement benefit plans. Contingencies Our accounting for contingencies covers a variety of business activities, including contingencies for legal and environmental exposures. We accrue these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated. We base our estimates on currently available facts and our assessments of the ultimate outcome or resolution. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than the completion of a remediation feasibility study. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.&#160 ; Our expenditures for environmental evaluation, mitigation, remediation and compliance to date have not been significant in relation to our financial position or results of operations, and our expenditures related to environmental matters had no material effect on earnings or cash flows during 2010, 2009 and 2008. Actual results may differ from our estimates resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on earnings. See Note P of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of contingencies. 42 Table of Contents FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATING INFORMATION Consolidated Operations Selected Financial Results The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Financial Results 2010 2009 2008 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Revenues $ 13,030.0 $ 11,111.6 $ 16,157.4 $ 1,918.4 17 % $ (5,045.8 ) (31 %) Cost of sales and fuel 10,957.5 9,095.7 14,221.9 1,861.8 20 % (5,126.2 ) (36 %) Net margin 2,072.5 2,015.9 1,935.5 56.6 3 % 80.4 4 % Operating costs 839.8 837.1 776.9 2.7 0 % 60.2 8 % Depreciation and amortization 307.3 289.0 243.9 18.3 6 % 45.1 18 % Gain (loss) on sale of assets 18.6 4.8 2.3 13.8 * 2.5 * Operating income $ 944.0 $ 894.6 $ 917.0 $ 49.4 6 % $ (22.4 ) (2 %) Equity earnings from investments $ 101.9 $ 72.7 $ 101.4 $ 29.2 40 % $ (28.7 ) (28 %) Allowance for equity funds used during construction $ 1.0 $ 26.9 $ 50.9 $ (25.9 ) (96 %) $ (24.0 ) (47 %) Interest expense $ (292.2 ) $ (300.8 ) $ (264.2 ) $ (8.6 ) (3 %) $ 36.6 14 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests $ (206.7 ) $ (185.8 ) $ (288.6 ) $ 20.9 11 % $ (102.8 ) (36 %) Capital expenditures $ 582.7 $ 791.2 $ 1,473.1 $ (208.5 ) (26 %) $ (681.9 ) (46 %) * Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 2010 vs. 2009 Commodity prices were generally higher during 2010, compared with 2009, which had a direct impact on our revenues and cost of sales and fuel. Our operating results include the benefits from a full year of ONEOK Partners more than $2.0 billion of completed growth projects that were placed in service in 2009. Operating income increased 6 percent in 2010, when compared with 2009, reflecting higher NGL volumes, higher contracted natural gas transportation capacity, an increase in natural gas processing volumes, higher natural gas and NGL storage margins and a gain on the sale of a 49 percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company in our ONEOK Partners segment. These increases were offset partially by ONEOK Partners lower NGL optimization margins. Our Distribution segment benefited from new rates in Oklahoma that increased fixed fees and lowered our volumetric sensitivity, providing more consistent revenues each month. Our Energy Services segments results were consistent with the prior year, with higher realized seasonal storage price differentials and marketing margins offset by lower realized Mid Continent to Gulf Coast transportation margins and lower premium services margins. Operating costs increased due primarily to the recognition of previously deferred integrity management costs in our Distribution segment that are now being recovered through rates, offset partially by lower than estimated ad valorem taxes in our ONEOK Partners segment and lower legal related costs in our Energy Services segment. Our results were also favorably impacted by increased equity earnings from investments in our ONEOK Partners segment. The overall increase is due primarily to increased contracted capacity on Northern Border Pipeline, which benefited from wider natural gas price differentials between the markets it serves, and as a result of accounting for ONEOK Partners 50 percent investment in Overland Pass Pipeline Company as an equity investment beginning September 2010. 2009 vs. 2008 Commodity prices were generally lower during 2009, compared with 2008, which had a direct impact on our revenues and cost of sales and fuel. Operations associated with ONEOK Partners growth projects were increasing since these projects were placed in service in late 2008 and in 2009. Operating income in 2009 decreased 2 percent, compared with 2008, due primarily to lower realized commodity prices and less favorable NGL price differentials. These decreases were offset partially by substantially higher NGL volumes; higher natural gas transportation contracted capacity attributable to ONEOK Partners completed growth projects; increased transportation and premium services margins in our Energy Services segment; and additional revenues from capital recovery mechanisms in our Distribution segment. 43 Table of Contents Operating costs increased due primarily to incremental costs associated with the operation of ONEOK Partners completed capital projects; and increased employee related costs in our Distribution segment. These increases were offset partially by lower bad debt expense in our Distribution segment. Equity earnings from investments decreased due primarily to lower subscription volumes and rates on Northern Border Pipeline in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business and from the $8.3 million gain on the sale of Bison Pipeline LLC by Northern Border Pipeline in 2008. Equity earnings also decreased due to lower natural gas gathering volumes, primarily in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, in ONEOK Partners various natural gas gathering and processing equity investments. Interest expense increased due primarily to ONEOK Partners March 2009 debt issuance and a decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of ONEOK Partners capital projects, offset partially by decreased borrowings by ONEOK. More information regarding our results of operations is provided in the following discussion of operating results for each of our segments. ONEOK Partners Selected Financial Results and Operating Information ONEOK Partners 2010 operating results include the benefits from a full year of operation of more than $2.0 billion in growth projects that it completed in 2009, reflecting increases in NGL volumes gathered, fractionated and sold in its natural gas liquids business, pipeline capacity contracted in its natural gas pipelines business and natural gas volumes processed in the Williston Basin in its natural gas gathering and processing business. ONEOK Partners expects continued development of the reserves in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations in the Williston Basin and in the Cana Woodford Shale and Granite Wash areas in Oklahoma and Texas, as drilling activities increase in these areas. ONEOK Partners placed the following projects in service during 2009: February Guardian Pipelines expansion and extension project in its natural gas pipeline business; March Grasslands natural gas processing plant expansion in its natural gas gathering and processing business; March D J Basin lateral pipeline in its natural gas liquids business; July Arbuckle Pipeline in its natural gas liquids business; and October Piceance lateral pipeline in its natural gas liquids business. The in service dates of these completed capital projects have impacted the period to period comparisons of net margin and operating expenses, primarily in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids and natural gas pipelines businesses, as operations associated with these projects have been increasing since being placed in service. Additionally, 2010 results for ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business include the gain on the sale of a 49 percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company. As a result of the sale, ONEOK Partners accounts for its 50 percent investment in Overland Pass Pipeline Company, which operates Overland Pass Pipeline and the D J Basin and Piceance lateral pipelines, as an equity investment beginning in September 2010. 44 Table of Contents The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for our ONEOK Partners segment for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Financial Results 2010 2009 2008 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Revenues $ 8,675.9 $ 6,474.5 $ 7,720.2 $ 2,201.4 34 % $ (1,245.7 ) (16 %) Cost of sales and fuel 7,531.0 5,355.2 6,579.5 2,175.8 41 % (1,224.3 ) (19 %) Net margin 1,144.9 1,119.3 1,140.7 25.6 2 % (21.4 ) (2 %) Operating costs 403.5 411.3 371.8 (7.8 ) (2 %) 39.5 11 % Depreciation and amortization 173.7 164.1 124.8 9.6 6 % 39.3 31 % Gain (loss) on sale of assets 18.6 2.7 0.7 15.9 * 2.0 * Operating income $ 586.3 $ 546.6 $ 644.8 $ 39.7 7 % $ (98.2 ) (15 %) Equity earnings from investments $ 101.9 $ 72.7 $ 101.4 $ 29.2 40 % $ (28.7 ) (28 %) Allowance for equity funds used during construction $ 1.0 $ 26.9 $ 50.9 $ (25.9 ) (96 %) $ (24.0 ) (47 %) Interest expense $ (204.3 ) $ (206.0 ) $ (151.1 ) $ (1.7 ) (1 %) $ 54.9 36 % Capital expenditures $ 352.7 $ 615.7 $ 1,253.9 $ (263.0 ) (43 %) $ (638.2 ) (51 %) * Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 2010 vs. 2009 Net margin increased due primarily to the following: an increase of $51.4 million due to higher NGL volumes gathered, fractionated and transported, primarily associated with the completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline, Piceance lateral pipeline and D J Basin lateral pipeline, as well as new NGL supply connections in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business; an increase of $14.4 million due to higher storage margins, primarily as a result of contract renegotiations in ONEOK Partners natural gas pipelines and natural gas liquids businesses; an increase of $9.1 million due to increased Williston Basin volumes in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business; and an increase of $8.7 million from higher natural gas transportation margins from an increase in contracted capacity on Midwestern Gas Transmission, Viking Gas Transmissions Fargo lateral pipeline and the incremental margin from the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension project in ONEOK Partners natural gas pipelines business; offset partially by a decrease of $34.7 million related to lower optimization margins due to limited NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities between the Mid Continent and Gulf Coast NGL market centers until September 2010 and less favorable NGL price differentials in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business; a decrease of $7.8 million due to decreased volumes processed and sold in western Oklahoma and Kansas as a result of natural production declines, operational outages and a period of ethane rejection in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business; a decrease of $6.5 million from selling ONEOK Partners Lehman Brothers bankruptcy claims in 2009; and a decrease of $6.3 million due to lower natural gas volumes gathered as a result of natural production declines and reduced drilling activity by its customers in the Powder River Basin in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business. Operating costs decreased due primarily to a decrease of $8.2 million due to lower than estimated ad valorem taxes associated with ONEOK Partners capital projects completed in 2009 in its natural gas liquids business. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of ONEOK Partners capital projects completed in 2009 in its natural gas liquids and natural gas pipelines businesses, offset partially by the deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline Company in the third quarter of 2010 in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business. Gain (loss) on sale of assets increased due primarily to the gain on sale of a 49 percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business. Equity earnings from investments increased due primarily to increased contracted capacity on Northern Border Pipeline due to wider natural gas price differentials in ONEOK Partners natural gas pipelines business and equity earnings from ONEOK Partners investment in Overland Pass Pipeline Company, which was deconsolidated in September 2010. 45 Table of Contents Allowance for equity funds used during construction and capital expenditures decreased due primarily to ONEOK Partners completed capital projects in 2009 in its natural gas liquids and natural gas pipelines businesses. 2009 vs. 2008 The Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension was placed into service in February 2009 and impacts the period to period comparisons of ONEOK Partners and specifically its natural gas pipelines business. The Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects were placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2008, and operations of those assets have been increasing since that time. The Arbuckle Pipeline was placed in service during the third quarter of 2009, and operations have been increasing since that time. The in service dates of those projects have impacted the period to period comparisons of net margin and expense for ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business. Net margin decreased due primarily to the following: a decrease of $106.0 million due to lower realized commodity prices in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business; and a decrease of $41.7 million due to less favorable NGL price differentials in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business; offset partially by an increase of $68.7 million due to increased NGL volumes gathered, fractionated and transported, primarily associated with the completion of the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects, and the Arbuckle Pipeline, as well as new NGL supply connections in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business; an increase of $38.8 million due to higher natural gas transportation margins from the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension that was completed in February 2009 and an increase in volumes contracted on Midwestern Gas Transmission in ONEOK Partners natural gas pipelines business; and an increase of $23.5 million due to higher volumes processed and sold in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business. Operating costs increased due primarily to higher employee related costs in all of ONEOK Partners businesses, the incremental costs associated with the operation of the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects and Arbuckle Pipeline, and costs associated with the expanded Bushton Plant fractionator in its natural gas liquids business. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of ONEOK Partners completed capital projects, primarily in its natural gas liquids business and also in its natural gas pipelines business. Equity earnings from investments decreased due primarily to lower subscription volumes and rates on Northern Border Pipeline, in ONEOK Partners natural gas pipeline business. Additionally, there was a gain on the sale of Bison Pipeline LLC by Northern Border Pipeline in the third quarter of 2008. Equity earnings from investments also decreased due to lower natural gas volumes gathered in ONEOK Partners various natural gas gathering and processing equity investments whose assets are located primarily in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. Allowance for equity funds used during construction decreased due primarily to the completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline in July 2009 and the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business, and the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension that was placed in service in February 2009 in its natural gas pipelines business. Interest expense increased due primarily to ONEOK Partners March 2009 debt issuance and a decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of ONEOK Partners capital projects, primarily in its natural gas liquids business. Capital expenditures decreased due primarily to the completion of ONEOK Partners capital projects, primarily related to its natural gas liquids business. 46 Table of Contents Selected Operating Information The following table sets forth selected operating information for our ONEOK Partners segment for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2010 2009 2008 Natural gas gathered (BBtu/d) (a) 1,067 1,123 1,164 Natural gas processed (BBtu/d) (a) 674 658 641 Natural gas transportation capacity contracted (MDth/d) (b) 5,616 5,507 4,835 Transportation capacity subscribed 87 % 86 % 83 % Residue gas sales (BBtu/d) (a) 286 291 279 NGL sales (MBbl/d) (c) 457 408 283 NGLs fractionated (MBbl/d) 512 481 389 NGLs transported gathering lines (MBbl/d) 440 372 260 NGLs transported distribution lines (MBbl/d) 468 459 331 Conway to Mont Belvieu OPIS average price differential Ethane ($/gallon) $ 0.10 $ 0.11 $ 0.15 Realized composite NGL net sales price ($/gallon) (a) (d) $ 0.94 $ 0.90 $ 1.26 Realized condensate net sales price ($/Bbl) (a) (d) $ 63.81 $ 78.35 $ 88.35 Realized residue gas net sales price ($/MMBtu) (a) (d) $ 5.58 $ 3.55 $ 7.53 Realized gross processing spread ($/MMBtu) (a) $ 6.41 $ 6.63 $ 7.47 (a) Statistics relate to ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business.

Operating costs increased due primarily to an increase of $15.5 million related to the recognition of previously deferred Integrity Management Program costs in Oklahoma that have been approved for recovery in our revenues. Depreciation and amortization expense increased due primarily to an increase of $6.7 million in regulatory amortization associated with revenue rider recoveries. 2009 vs. 2008 Net margin increased due primarily to the following: an increase of $26.3 million resulting from capital recovery mechanisms, which includes a $22.3 million increase in Oklahoma, a $3.0 million increase in Kansas and a $1.0 million increase in Texas; an increase of $6.3 million in rider recoveries; an increase of $3.2 million in retail marketing margins; and an increase of $1.9 million resulting from the implementation of new rate mechanisms in Texas; offset partially by a decrease of $1.7 million due to lower sales volumes. Operating costs increased due primarily to the following: an increase of $20.8 million in employee related costs due primarily to increased incentive and benefit costs; and an increase of $3.4 million in property tax expense; offset partially by a decrease of $10.3 million in bad debt expense as a result of the authorized recovery of the fuel related portion of bad debts in Oklahoma, effective January 2009; and a decrease of $5.3 million in vehicle related costs. Depreciation and amortization expense increased due primarily to the following: an increase of $4.8 million in regulatory amortization associated with previously deferred costs that have been approved for recovery in our revenues; and 48 Table of Contents an increase of $1.0 million in depreciation expense related to our investment in property, plant and equipment. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditure program includes expenditures for extending service to new areas, modifications to customer service lines, increasing system capabilities, general replacements and improvements, including an automated meter reading investment in Oklahoma. It is our practice to maintain and upgrade facilities to ensure safe, reliable and efficient operations. Capital expenditures increased for 2010, compared with 2009, primarily as a result of expenditures related to an investment in automated meter reading in Oklahoma. Capital expenditures decreased for 2009, compared with 2008, primarily as a result of lower spending on growth projects due to the economic slowdowns experienced in our service territories during 2009. Selected Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected information for the regulated operations of our Distribution segment for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, Number of Customers 2010 2009 2008 Residential 1,912,205 1,901,782 1,886,118 Commercial 153,650 156,337 159,748 Industrial 1,271 1,343 1,420 Wholesale 35 27 28 Public Authority 2,666 2,740 2,963 Transportation 11,308 10,410 10,376 Total customers 2,081,135 2,072,639 2,060,653 Years Ended December 31, Volumes (MMcf) 2010 2009 2008 Gas sales Residential 121,240 120,370 125,834 Commercial 35,223 35,414 37,758 Industrial 1,211 1,208 1,395 Wholesale 9,212 10,032 7,186 Public Authority 2,848 2,673 2,592 Total volumes sold 169,734 169,697 174,765 Transportation 205,692 201,952 219,398 Total volumes delivered 375,426 371,649 394,163 Residential volumes increased during 2010, compared with 2009, due to colder temperatures across our entire service territory in the first quarter of 2010; however, the impact on margin was moderated by weather normalization mechanisms. Residential volumes decreased during 2009, compared with 2008, due to warmer temperatures across our entire service territory; however, the impact on margin was moderated by weather normalization mechanisms. Wholesale sales represent contracted natural gas volumes that exceed the needs of our residential, commercial and industrial customer base and are available for sale to other parties. Public authority natural gas volumes reflect volumes used by state agencies and school districts served by Texas Gas Service. Regulatory Initiatives Oklahoma In September 2010, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed an application and supporting testimony with the OCC seeking approval of a demand portfolio of conservation and energy efficiency programs and authorizing recovery of costs and performance incentives. The proposed programs include: Energy Efficiency Education Program, Heating System Check Up Program, Low Income Energy Efficiency Assistance Program, Water Heater Replacement Program, Space Heating Replacement Program, Clothes Dryer Replacement Program, New Homes Program and Commercial Customer Program. A settlement agreement was reached between all the parties to the filing and filed at the 49 Table of Contents OCC on February 10, 2011. This agreement allows Oklahoma Natural Gas to pursue the key energy efficiency programs requested in its filing. The settlement agreement was presented to an administrative law judge in a hearing on February 18, 2011. In June 2010, the OCC approved recovery of our Integrity Management Program deferral for 2009 and annual adjustments associated with the prior recovery period in the amount of $16.7 million. Billing of the new rates began July 1, 2010. In December 2009, the OCC approved a rate increase of $54.5 million, which included moving existing riders into base rates that effectively reduced the rate increase to a net amount of $25.7 million. The new rates went into effect on December 18, 2009, and reduce our volumetric exposure. Under a previous order, Oklahoma Natural Gas migrated from traditional rates to performance based rates that provide for a streamlined annual review of the companys performance, resulting in smaller, potentially more frequent rate adjustments. Kansas In December 2010, the KCC approved Kansas Gas Services application to increase the Gas System Reliability Surcharge, resulting in a $1.7 million increase in operating income for 2011, effective with customer billings in January 2011. In May 2010, Kansas Gas Service was granted a motion to withdraw its application with the KCC to become an Efficiency Kansas Loan Program utility partner and provide a portfolio of energy efficiency programs designed to encourage the purchase of energy efficient natural gas appliances. The application was withdrawn as a result of the wide discrepancy between the positions of the parties involved in the case. Kansas Gas Service will continue to explore opportunities to promote energy efficiency initiatives in a manner that does not penalize Kansas Gas Service and meets regulators requirements. In December 2009, the KCC approved Kansas Gas Services application to increase the Gas System Reliability Surcharge. In April 2010, the surcharge recovery was slightly reduced as a result of a revised application. The impact of the Gas System Reliability Surcharge on 2010 operating income was an increase of $3.4 million. Texas In December 2009, Texas Gas Service filed a statement of intent to increase rates in its El Paso service area by $7.3 million. On April 13, 2010, the City of El Paso rejected the proposed increase. Texas Gas Service filed an appeal on May 12, 2010, with the RRC. The filing updated rate base and cost of service for pension expense and included a statement of intent to increase rates by $5.3 million. Subsequently, rate case expenses were placed into a separate docket, effectively reducing the requested increase to $4.4 million. On December 14, 2010, the RRC approved a base rate increase of $0.8 million annually and a $0.8 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, plus recovery of annual pipeline integri ty expenditures via a separate rider. General Certain costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process have been capitalized as regulatory assets. Should recovery cease due to regulatory actions, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for recognition and accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. There were no write offs of regulatory assets resulting from the failure to meet the criteria for capitalization during 2010, 2009 or 2008.

Risk management and operational decisions have an impact on the net result of our marketing, premium services and storage activities. We evaluate our strategies on an ongoing basis to optimize the value of our contracted assets and to minimize the financial impact of market conditions on the services we provide. Financial trading, net, includes activities that are executed generally using financially settled derivatives. These activities are normally short term in nature, with a focus on capturing short term price volatility. Revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income include financial trading margins, as well as certain physical natural gas transactions with our trading counterparties. Revenues and cost of sales and fuel from such physical transactions are reported on a net basis. 2010 vs. 2009 Net margin was relatively unchanged but reflects the following: an increase of $39.7 million in storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to the following: higher realized seasonal storage price differentials and a decrease in storage expense due to the reduction in storage capacity; offset partially by a reduction in storage withdrawals due to decreased natural gas storage capacity under lease; and unfavorable unrealized fair value changes on non qualifying economic hedge activity and marketing margins; and an increase of $3.1 million in financial trading margins; offset by a decrease of $21.4 million in transportation margins, net of hedging, due primarily to narrower realized Mid Continent to Gulf Coast price differentials; and a decrease of $21.3 million in premium services margins, associated primarily with lower demand fees as a result of lower volatility of natural gas prices, offset partially by the favorable management of customer peaking requirements resulting from warmer weather in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with the same period last year. Operating costs decreased due primarily to a decrease in legal related costs and property taxes. 2009 vs. 2008 Net margin increased due primarily to the following: an increase of $41.3 million in transportation margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to higher realized Rocky Mountain to Mid Continent transportation margins, resulting from the following: realization of more favorable hedges related to transportation spreads; and favorable unrealized fair value changes on non qualifying economic hedge activity and ineffectiveness on qualified hedges; an increase of $13.9 million in premium services, associated primarily with managing our demand load, due to warmer weather in the first quarter of 2009, offset partially by increased peaking demand load due to colder than normal weather in the fourth quarter of 2009; and an increase of $7.8 million in storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to the following: favorable unrealized fair value changes on non qualifying economic hedge activity and marketing margins; and the impact of a lower of cost or market inventory write down of $9.7 million in the third quarter 2008; offset partially by lower realized seasonal storage differentials. Operating costs increased due to higher legal and employee related costs. 51 Table of Contents Selected Operating Information The following table sets forth certain selected operating information for our Energy Services segment for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2010 2009 2008 Natural gas marketed (Bcf) 919 1,105 1,173 Natural gas gross margin ($/Mcf) $ 0.18 $ 0.15 $ 0.09 Physically settled volumes (Bcf) 1,874 2,217 2,374 Our Energy Services segment has focused its efforts on aligning its contracted natural gas transportation and storage capacity with meeting the needs of our premium services customers. The effect of this strategy has been a reduction in our contracted natural gas transportation and storage capacity, which also will reduce our working capital requirements primarily through a reduction in natural gas inventory levels. Our natural gas in storage at December 31, 2010, was 63.0 Bcf, compared with 60.5 Bcf at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, our total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 73.6 Bcf, compared with 82.8 Bcf at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, our natural gas storage capacity under lease had a maximum withdrawal capability of 2.2 Bcf/d and maximum injection capability of 1.3 Bcf/d. At December 31, 2010, our natural gas transportation capacity was 1.4 Bcf/d, of which 1.1 Bcf/d was contracted under long term natural gas transportation contracts, compared with 1.7 Bcf/d of total capacity and 1.4 Bcf/d of long term capacity at the end of 2009. Natural gas volumes marketed and physically settled volumes decreased during 2010, compared with 2009, due primarily to reduced transportation capacity and lower transported volumes. Transportation capacity in certain markets was not utilized due to the economics of the location differentials. Natural gas volumes marketed decreased during 2009, compared with 2008, due primarily to significantly warmer weather in November 2009, compared with the same period in 2008. In addition, during the first quarter of 2009, compared with the first quarter 2008, we experienced fewer incremental sales from inventory beyond our normal baseload due to warmer than normal temperatures. CONTINGENCIES Legal Proceedings We are a party to various litigation matters and claims that have arisen in the normal in the course of our operations. While the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Additional information about our legal proceedings is included under Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Annual Report. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES General Part of our strategy is to grow through internally generated growth projects and acquisitions that strengthen and complement our existing assets. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners have relied primarily on operating cash flow, commercial paper, bank credit facilities, debt issuances and or the sale of equity for their liquidity and capital resource requirements. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners fund their operating expenses, debt service, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders primarily with operating cash flow. We expect to continue to use these sources and ONEOK Partners commercial paper program, discussed below, for liquidity and capital resource needs on both a short and long term basis. Neither ONEOK nor ONEOK Partn ers guarantees the debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated parties, and ONEOK does not guarantee the debt or other similar commitments of ONEOK Partners. In 2010, ONEOK accessed the commercial paper markets to meet its short term liquidity needs, and ONEOK Partners utilized the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and accessed the commercial paper markets beginning in June 2010 to fund its short term liquidity needs. Additionally, ONEOK Partners accessed the public debt markets in January 2011 and the public equity markets in February 2010 for its long term financing needs. See discussion below under ONEOK Partners Debt Issuance and ONEOK Partners Equity Issuance for more information. In June 2010, ONEOK Partners established a commercial paper program providing for the issuance of up to $1.0 billion of unsecured commercial paper notes to fund its short term borrowing needs. The maturities of ONEOK Partners commercial paper notes vary but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue. ONEOK Partners commercial paper notes are 52 Table of Contents generally sold at a negotiated discount from par. The ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, which expires in March 2012, is available to repay its commercial paper notes, if necessary. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program reduce the borrowing capacity under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners ability to continue to access capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on market conditions and ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners respective financial condition and credit ratings. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners anticipate that cash flow generated from operations, existing capital resources and ability to obtain financing will enable both entities to maintain current levels of operations and planned operations, collateral requirements and fund capital expenditures. Capitalization Structure The following table sets forth our consolidated capitalization structure for the periods indicated: December 31, December 31, 2010 2009 Long term debt 52% 57% Total equity 48% 43% Debt (including notes payable) 55% 61% Total equity 45% 39% For purposes of determining compliance with financial covenants in the ONEOK Credit Agreement, which are described below, the debt of ONEOK Partners is excluded. The following table sets forth ONEOKs capital structure, excluding the debt of ONEOK Partners, for the periods indicated: December 31, December 31, 2010 2009 Long term debt 38% 41% ONEOK shareholders equity 62% 59% Debt (including notes payable) 40% 46% ONEOK shareholders equity 60% 54% Stock Repurchase Program In October 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a three year stock repurchase program to buy up to $750 million of our outstanding common stock, subject to the limitation that purchases will not exceed $300 million in any one calendar year. If shares are repurchased, they will be acquired from time to time in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. Any purchases will be funded by our available cash, free cash flow and short term borrowings. The program will terminate upon completion of the repurchase of $750 million of common stock or on December 31, 2013, whichever occurs first. As of February 21, 2011, no shares have been repurc hased under the program. Cash Management ONEOK and ONEOK Partners each use similar centralized cash management programs that concentrate the cash assets of their operating subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing, transaction costs and bank fees. Both centralized cash management programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of the operating subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the respective consolidated groups. ONEOK Partners operating subsidiaries participate in these programs to the extent they are permitted pursuant to FERC regulations or their operating agreements. Under these cash management programs, dependi ng on whether a participating subsidiary has short term cash surpluses or cash requirements, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners provide cash to their respective subsidiaries or the subsidiaries provide cash to them. Short term Liquidity ONEOKs principal sources of short term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities, quarterly distributions from ONEOK Partners and the issuance of commercial paper. To the extent commercial paper is unavailable, the ONEOK Credit Agreement may be utilized. The ONEOK Credit Agreement expires in July 2011 and we anticipate entering into a new agreement prior to the maturity date. ONEOK Partners principal sources of short term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities, the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and ONEOK Partners commercial paper program. The total amount of short term borrowings authorized by ONEOKs Board of Directors is $2.5 billion. At December 31, 2010, ONEOK had $127.0 million in commercial paper outstanding, $27.0 million in letters of credit issued under the ONEOK Credit Agreement and approximately $30.1 million of available cash and cash equivalents. ONEOK had 53 Table of Contents approximately $1.0 billion of credit available at December 31, 2010, under the ONEOK Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2010, ONEOK could have issued $3.7 billion of additional short and long term debt under the most restrictive provisions contained in its various borrowing agreements. The total amount of short term borrowings authorized by the Board of Directors of ONEOK Partners GP, the general partner of ONEOK Partners, is $2.5 billion. At December 31, 2010, ONEOK Partners had $429.9 million in commercial paper outstanding, no borrowings outstanding under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, leaving approximately $570.1 million of credit available under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, and approximately $0.9 million of available cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, ONEOK Partners could have issued $1.0 billion of additional short and long term debt under the most restrictive provisions contained in its various borrowing agreements. At December 31, 2010, ONEOK Partners had $24.2 million in letters of credit issued outside the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. The ONEOK Credit Agreement contains certain financial, operational and legal covenants. These requirements include, among others: a $400 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit; a limitation on ONEOKs stand alone debt to capital ratio, which may not exceed 67.5 percent at the end of any calendar quarter; a requirement that ONEOK maintains the power to control the management and policies of ONEOK Partners, a limit on new investments in master limited partnerships; and other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants relating to liens, investments, fundamental changes in ONEOKs businesses, changes in the nature of ONEOKs businesses, transactions with affiliates, the use of proceeds and a covenant that prevents ONEOK from restricting its subsidiaries ability to pay dividends. The debt covenant calculations in the ONEOK Credit Agreement exclude the debt of ONEOK Partners. Upon breach of any covenant by ONEOK, amounts outstanding under the ONEOK Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2010, ONEOKs stand alone debt to capital ratio, as defined by the ONEOK Credit Agreement, was 39.4 percent, and ONEOK was in compliance with all covenants under the ONEOK Credit Agreement. Under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, ONEOK Partners is required to comply with certain financial, operational and legal covenants. Among other things, these requirements include maintaining a ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA, as defined in ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, as adjusted for all non cash charges and increased for projected EBITDA from certain lender approved capital expansion projects) of no more than 5 to 1. If ONEOK Partners consummates one or more acquisitions in which the aggregate purchase price is $25 million or more, the allowable ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA will be increased to 5.5 to 1 for the three calendar quarters following the acquisition. Upon any breach of any covenant by ONEOK Partners in its ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, amounts out standing under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2010, ONEOK Partners ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA was 3.79 to 1, and ONEOK Partners was in compliance with all covenants under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. As a result of ONEOK Partners January 2011 debt issuance, available borrowings are limited by the ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA covenant under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement; however, ONEOK Partners had approximately $956 million in cash at January 31, 2011, and $266 million of available borrowings that provide ample liquidity to meet its funding needs. ONEOK Partners expects the limitation of its available borrowings to be eliminated during 2011. At December 31, 2010, the weighted average interest rate on each of ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners short term debt outstanding was 0.38 percent. The weighted average interest rates for the year ended December 31, 2010, on ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners short term borrowings were 0.30 percent and 0.58 percent, respectively. Based on the forward LIBOR curve, we expect the interest rates on ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners short term borrowings to increase in 2011, compared with interest rates on amounts outstanding at December 31, 2010. Long term Financing In addition to the principal sources of short term liquidity discussed above, options available to ONEOK to meet its longer term cash requirements include the issuance of equity, issuance of long term notes, issuance of convertible debt securities, asset securitization and the sale and leaseback of facilities. Options available to ONEOK Partners to meet its longer term cash requirements include the issuance of common units, issuance of long term notes, issuance of convertible debt securities, and asset securitization and sale and leaseback of facilities. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners are subject to changes in the debt and equity markets, and there is no assurance they will be able or willing to access the public or private markets in the future. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners may choose to meet their cash requirements by utilizing some combination of cash flows from operations, borrowing under existing commercial paper or credit facilities, altering the timing of controllable expenditures, restricting future acquisitions and capital projects, or 54 Table of Contents pursuing other debt or equity financing alternatives. Some of these alternatives could involve higher costs or negatively affect their respective credit ratings, among other factors. Based on ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners investment grade credit ratings, general financial condition and market expectations regarding their future earnings and projected cash flows, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners believe that they will be able to meet their respective cash requirements and maintain their investment grade credit ratings. ONEOK Partners Equity Issuance In February 2010, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of 5,500,900 common units, including the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option, at a public offering price of $60.75 per common unit, generating net proceeds of approximately $322.7 million. In conjunction with the offering, ONEOK Partners GP contributed $6.8 million in order to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest. ONEOK Partners used the proceeds from the sale of common units and the general partner co ntribution to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and for general partnership purposes. ONEOK Partners Debt Maturity In June 2010, ONEOK Partners repaid $250.0 million of maturing senior notes with available cash and short term borrowings. With the repayment of these notes, ONEOK Partners no longer has any obligation to offer to repurchase the $225 million senior notes due March 2011 in the event that ONEOK Partners long term debt credit ratings fall below investment grade. ONEOK Partners Debt Issuance In January 2011, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of $1.3 billion senior notes, consisting of $650 million of 3.25 percent senior notes due 2016 and $650 million of 6.125 percent senior notes due 2041. The net proceeds from the offering of approximately $1.28 billion were used to repay amounts outstanding under ONEOK Partners commercial paper program and for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures, and will be used to repay the $225 million principal amount of senior notes due March 2011. Debt Covenants The indentures governing ONEOKs senior notes due 2011, 2019 and 2028 include an event of default upon acceleration of other indebtedness of $15 million or more, and the indentures governing the senior notes due 2015 and 2035 include an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of $100 million or more. Such events of default would entitle the trustee or the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior notes due 2011, 2015, 2019, 2028 and 2035 to declare those notes immediately due and payable in full. ONEOK may redeem the notes due 2011, 2015, 2028 (6.875 percent) and 2035, in whole or in part, at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make whole premium. ONEOK may redeem the notes due 2019 and 2028 (6.5 percent), in whole or in part, at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption price will never be less than 100 percent of the principal amount of the respective note plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The notes due 2011, 2015, 2019, 2028 and 2035 are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with all of ONEOKs existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The indentures governing ONEOK Partners senior notes due March 2011 include an event of default upon acceleration of other indebtedness of $25 million or more, and the indentures governing its other senior notes include an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of $100 million or more. Such events of default would entitle the trustee or the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of ONEOK Partners outstanding senior notes to declare those notes immediately due and payable in full. ONEOK Partners may redeem the notes due 2011, 2012, 2016 (6.15 percent), 2019, 2036 and 2037, in whole or in part, at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make whole premium. The redemption price will never be less than 100 percent of the principal amount of the respective note plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. ONEOK Partners may redeem its 3.25 percent notes due 2016 and 6.125 percent notes due 2041 at par starting one and six months, respectively, before their maturity dates. Prior to these times, ONEOK Partners may redeem these notes on the same terms as its other senior notes. ONEOK Partners senior notes are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equally in right of payment wi th all of ONEOK Partners existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, and structurally subordinate to all of the existing and future debt and other liabilities of any non guarantor subsidiaries. ONEOK Partners senior notes are nonrecourse to ONEOK. Capital Expenditures ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners capital expenditures are financed through operating cash flows, short and long term debt and the issuance of equity. Capital expenditures were $582.7 million, $791.2 million and $1,473.1 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, exclusive of acquisitions. Of these amounts, ONEOK Partners capital expenditures were $352.7 million, $615.7 million and $1,253.9 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, exclusive of acquisitions. Capital expenditures in 2010 were significantly less than 2009, due primarily to the completion of the Arbuckle 55 Table of Contents Pipeline, the D J Basin lateral pipeline, Piceance lateral pipeline, the Grasslands natural gas processing plant expansion and the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension. This decrease is offset partially by an increase in capital expenditures in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business related primarily to its projects in the Williston Basin. The following table sets forth our 2011 projected capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC: 2011 Projected Capital Expenditures (Millions of dollars) ONEOK Partners $ 1,116 Distribution 224 Other 22 Total projected capital expenditures $ 1,362 Overland Pass Pipeline Company In September 2010, ONEOK Partners completed a transaction to sell a 49 percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company to a subsidiary of Williams Partners, resulting in each joint venture member now owning 50 percent of Overland Pass Pipeline Company. In accordance with the joint venture agreement, ONEOK Partners received approximately $423.7 million in cash at closing. ONEOK Partners used the proceeds from the transaction to repay short term debt and to fund a portion of its recently announced capital projects. In 2011, ONEOK Partners expects to make contributions of approximately $35 million to $40 million for additional pump stations and the expansion of existing pump stations to increase the capacity of Overland Pass Pipeline to accommodate increased volumes of unfractionated NGLs from the Bakken Pipeline and other supply sources under development in the Rockies. Other We lease portions of equipment at a natural gas processing plant under non cancelable operating leases. We acquired the leases in a business combination in prior years. ONEOK Partners has certain contractual rights to the Bushton Plant through a Processing and Services Agreement with us, which sets out the terms for processing and related services we provide at the Bushton Plant through 2012. ONEOK Partners has contracted for all of the capacity of the Bushton Plant from us. In exchange, ONEOK Partners pays us for all costs and expenses necessary for the operation and maintenance of the Bushton Plant and reimburses us for our obligations under equipment leases covering portions of the Bushton Plant. The Bushton equipment leases will expire in 2012 unless, in the second quarter of 2011, we provide irrevocable notice of our intent to either renew the equipment leases at fair market rental value or purchase the original leased equipment (or any replacement parts) pursuant to the terms of the equipment leases. The Processing and Services Agreement provides that ONEOK Partners will reimburse us for any amounts incurred in connection with the foregoing option, if any. The Northern Border Pipeline partnership agreement provides that distributions to Northern Border Pipelines partners are to be made on a pro rata basis according to each partners percentage interest. The Northern Border Pipeline Management Committee determines the amount and timing of such distributions. Any changes to, or suspension of, the cash distribution policy of Northern Border Pipeline requires the unanimous approval of the Northern Border Pipeline Management Committee. Cash distributions are equal to 100 percent of distributable cash flow as determined from Northern Border Pipelines financial statements based upon EBITDA, less interest expense and maintenance capital expenditures. Loans or other advances from Northern Border Pipeline to its partners or affiliates ar e prohibited under its credit agreement. The Northern Border Pipeline Management Committee has adopted a cash distribution policy related to financial ratio targets and capital contributions. The cash distribution policy defines minimum equity to total capitalization ratios to be used by the Northern Border Pipeline Management Committee to establish the timing and amount of required capital contributions. In addition, any shortfall due to the inability to refinance maturing debt will be funded by capital contributions. See Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for a discussion of ONEOK Partners investment in Northern Border Pipeline. Northern Border Pipeline anticipates requiring an additional equity contribution of approximately $100 million to $120 million from its partners in 2011, of which ONEOK Partners share will be approximately $50 million to $60 million based on its 50 percent equity interest. 56 Table of Contents Credit Ratings Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2010, are shown in the table below: ONEOK ONEOK Partners Rating Agency Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Moodys Baa2 Stable Baa2 Stable S&P BBB Stable BBB Stable ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners commercial paper are rated Prime 2 by Moodys and A2 by S&P. ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners credit ratings, which are currently investment grade, may be affected by a material change in financial ratios or a material event affecting the business. The most common criteria for assessment of credit ratings are the debt to capital ratio, business risk profile, pretax and after tax interest coverage, and liquidity. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners do not currently anticipate their respective credit ratings to be downgraded. However, if ONEOKs or ONEOK Partners credit ratings were downgraded, the cost to borrow funds under their respective commercial paper programs and credit agreements would increase, and ONEOK or ONEOK Partners potenti ally could lose access to the commercial paper market. In the event that ONEOK is unable to borrow funds under its commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in its business, ONEOK would continue to have access to the ONEOK Credit Agreement, which expires in July 2011. In the event that ONEOK Partners is unable to borrow funds under its commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in its business, ONEOK Partners would continue to have access to the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, which expires in March 2012. An adverse rating change alone is not a default under the ONEOK Credit Agreement or the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. See additional discussion about our credit ratings under Long term Financing. Our Energy Services segment relies upon the investment grade rating of ONEOKs senior unsecured long term debt to reduce its collateral requirements. If ONEOKs credit ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to participate in energy marketing and trading activities could be significantly limited. Without an investment grade rating, we may be required to fund margin requirements with our counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments. At December 31, 2010, ONEOK could have been required to fund approximately $7.4 million in margin requirements related to financial contracts upon such a downgrade. A decline in ONEOKs credit rating below investment grade may also significantly impact other business segments. In the normal course of business, ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners counterparties provide secured and unsecured credit. In the event of a downgrade in ONEOKs or ONEOK Partners credit ratings or a significant change in ONEOKs or ONEOK Partners counterparties evaluation of our creditworthiness, ONEOK or ONEOK Partners could be required to provide additional collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments as a condition of continuing to conduct business with such counterparties. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price volatility. Significant fluctuations in commodity prices may impact our overall liquidity due to the impact commodity price changes have on our cash flows from operating activities, including the impact on working capital for NGLs and natural gas held in storage, margin requirements and certain energy related receivables. We believe that ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners available credit and cash and cash equivalents are adequate to meet liquidity requirements associated with commodity price volatility. See discussion beginning on page 62 under Commodity Price Risk in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, for information on our hedging activities. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans Information about our pension and postretirement benefits plans, including anticipated contributions, in included under Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. During 2010, we made contributions of $96.8 million and $12.5 million to our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, respectively. These contributions to our defined benefit pension plans included $57.0 million of contributions attributable to the 2011 plan year. We anticipate our total 2011 contributions will include an additional $4.3 million for our defined benefit pension plans and $13.9 million for our postretirement benefit plans. The expected 2011 benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be $15.2 million. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Information about our environmental matters is included in Environmental and Safety Matters of Item 1, Business and Note P of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. We cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions could have a 57 Table of Contents material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our expenditures for environmental evaluation, mitigation, remediation and compliance to date have not been significant in relation to our financial position or results of operations, and our expenditures related to environmental matters did not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows during 2010, 2009 and 2008. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS We use the indirect method to prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period. These reconciling items include depreciation and amortization, allowance for equity funds used during construction, gain or loss on sale of assets, equity earnings from investments, distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates, deferred income taxes, share based compensation expense, other amounts, and changes in our assets and liabilities not classified as investing or financing activities. The following table sets forth the changes in cash flows by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 2010 2009 2008 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 834.0 $ 1,452.7 $ 475.7 $ (618.7 ) (43 %) $ 977.0 * Investing activities (134.3 ) (787.8 ) (1,454.3 ) 653.5 83 % 666.5 46 % Financing activities (698.1 ) (1,145.6 ) 1,469.6 447.5 39 % (2,615.2 ) * Change in cash and cash equivalents 1.6 (480.7 ) 491.0 482.3 (100 %) (971.7 ) * Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 29.4 510.1 19.1 (480.7 ) (94 %) 491.0 * Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 31.0 $ 29.4 $ 510.1 $ 1.6 5 % $ (480.7 ) (94 %) * Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. Operating Cash Flows Operating cash flows are affected by earnings from our business activities. We provide services to producers and consumers of natural gas, condensate and NGLs. Changes in commodity prices and demand for our services or products, whether because of general economic conditions, changes in demand for the end products that are made with our products or increased competition from other service providers, could affect our earnings and operating cash flows. 2010 vs. 2009 Cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $994.9 million for 2010, compared with $974.3 million for 2009. The increase was due primarily to changes in net margin and operating expenses discussed in Financial Results and Operating Information on page 43. The changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows $160.9 million for 2010, compared with an increase of $478.4 million for 2009, primarily as a result of the impact of commodity prices on our operating assets and liabilities and an increase in volumes of commodities in storage primarily in our Distribution segment and ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business. 2009 vs. 2008 Cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $974.3 million for 2009, compared with $991.0 million for 2008. The decrease was due primarily to changes in net margin and operating expenses discussed in Financial Results and Operating Information beginning on page 43. The changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows $478.4 million for 2009, compared with a decrease of $515.3 million for 2008, primarily as a result of the following: a decrease in cash collateral and margin requirements in our Energy Services segment; and the impact of commodity prices on our operating assets and liabilities. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities decreased for 2010, compared with 2009, due primarily to the $423.7 million in proceeds ONEOK Partners received from the sale of a 49 percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company in 2010 and reduced capital expenditures as a result of the completion of the capital projects in our ONEOK Partners segment in 2009. Cash used in investing activities decreased for 2009, compared with 2008, due primarily to reduced capital expenditures as a result of the completion of the capital projects in our ONEOK Partners segment in 2009. 58 Table of Contents Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities decreased for 2010, compared with the 2009, due primarily to decreased borrowings resulting from the completion of ONEOK Partners capital projects in 2009, ONEOK Partners repayment of $250 million of maturing senior notes in 2010, an increase of approximately 12.0 percent in dividends paid during 2010, an increase of approximately 3.0 percent in cash distributions per unit paid to noncontrolling interests and additional ONEOK Partners common units, offset partially by increased net proceeds generated from ONEOK Partners common unit offering in 2010. Cash used in financing activities increased for 2009, compared with cash provided by financing activities in 2008, due primarily to the repayment of amounts borrowed in 2008 related to ONEOK Partners capital projects, an increase of approximately 6.1 percent in dividends paid during 2009, an increase of approximately 3.0 percent in cash distributions per unit paid to noncontrolling interests and additional ONEOK Partners common units, offset partially by increased net proceeds generated from ONEOK Partners common unit offering in 2009.

Interest payments on debt Interest expense is calculated by multiplying long term debt by the respective coupon rates, adjusted for active swaps. Operating leases Our operating leases include a natural gas processing plant, office space, pipeline equipment, rights of way and vehicles. Operating lease obligations for ONEOK Partners exclude intercompany payments related to the lease of a natural gas processing plant. Firm transportation and storage contracts We are party to fixed price contracts for firm transportation and storage capacity. However, the costs associated with our Distribution segments contracts that are recovered through rates as allowed by the applicable regulatory agency are excluded from the table above. 59 Table of Contents Financial and physical derivatives These are obligations arising from our fixed and variable price purchase commitments for financial and physical commodity derivatives. However, the commitments associated with our Distribution segments contracts are recovered through rates as allowed by the applicable regulatory agency and are excluded from the table above. Estimated future variable price purchase commitments are based on market information at December 31, 2010. Actual future variable price purchase commitments may vary depending on market prices at the time of delivery. Not included in these amounts are offsetting cash inflows from our ONEOK Partners and Energy Services segments product sales and net positive set tlements. As market information changes daily and is potentially volatile, these values may change significantly. Additionally, product sales may require additional purchase obligations to fulfill sales obligations that are not reflected in these amounts. Employee benefit plans Employee benefit plans include our anticipated contribution to maintain the minimum required funding level to our pension and postretirement benefit plans for 2011. See Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for discussion of our employee benefit plans. Purchase commitments, rights of way and other Purchase commitments include commitments related to ONEOK Partners growth capital expenditures and other rights of way and contractual commitments. Purchase commitments exclude commodity purchase contracts, which are included in the Financial and physical derivatives amounts.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Policy and Oversight We control the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibilities for our risk management limits and policies. Our risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price and credit risk management, and marketing and trading activities. The committee also monitors risk metrics including value at risk (VAR) and mark to market losses. We have a risk control group that is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies and procedures and monitorin g certain risk metrics. Key risk control activities include risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics. Our exposure to market risk discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity prices. Our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in interest rates or commodity prices and the timing of transactions. COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to commodity price risk and the impact of market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. Commodity price risk refers to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in energy prices. To minimize the risk from market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, we use commodity derivative instruments such as futures, physical forward contracts, swaps and options to manage commodity price risk associated with existing or anticipated purchase and sale agreements, existing physical natural gas in storage and basis risk. ONEOK Partners ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of receiving commodities in exchange for its gathering and processing services. To a lesser extent, ONEOK Partners is exposed to the relative price differential between NGLs and natural gas, or the gross processing spread, with respect to its keep whole contracts. ONEOK Partners is also exposed to the risk of locational price differentials and the cost of third party transportation to various market locations. As part of ONEOK Partners hedging strategy, ONEOK Partners uses commodity fixed price physical forwards and derivative contracts, including NYMEX based futures and over the counter swaps, to minimize earnings volatility in its natural gas gathering and processing business related to natural gas, NGL and condensate price fluctuations . ONEOK Partners reduces its gross processing spread exposure through a combination of physical and financial hedges. ONEOK Partners utilizes a portion of its percent of proceeds equity natural gas as an offset, or natural hedge, to an equivalent portion of its keep whole shrink requirements. This has the effect of converting ONEOK Partners gross processing spread risk to NGL commodity price risk, and ONEOK Partners then uses financial instruments to hedge the sale of NGLs. 62 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2010, ONEOK Partners had $17.6 million of derivative assets and $6.5 million of derivative liabilities, excluding the impact of netting, all of which related to commodity contracts. The following tables set forth ONEOK Partners hedging information for the periods indicated, as of February 21, 2011: Year Ending December 31, 2011 Volumes Hedged Average Price Percentage Hedged NGLs (Bbl/d) (a) 5,469 $ 1.17 / gallon 67% Condensate (Bbl/d) (a) 1,713 $ 2.13 / gallon 75% Total (Bbl/d) 7,182 $ 1.40 / gallon 69% Natural gas (MMBtu/d) 24,596 $ 5.61 / MMBtu 74% (a) Hedged with fixed price swaps. Year Ending December 31, 2012 Volumes Hedged Average Price Percentage Hedged NGLs (Bbl/d) (a) 513 $ 2.34 / gallon 4% Condensate (Bbl/d) (a) 1,245 $ 2.34 / gallon 50% Total (Bbl/d) 1,758 $ 2.34 / gallon 12% (a) Hedged with fixed price swaps. ONEOK Partners commodity price risk is estimated as a hypothetical change in the price of NGLs, crude oil and natural gas, excluding the effects of hedging, and assuming normal operating conditions. ONEOK Partners condensate sales are based on the price of crude oil. ONEOK Partners estimates the following: a $0.01 per gallon decrease in the composite price of NGLs would decrease annual net margin by approximately $1.2 million; a $1.00 per barrel decrease in the price of crude oil would decrease annual net margin by approximately $1.1 million; and a $0.10 per MMBtu decrease in the price of natural gas would decrease annual net margin by approximately $1.1 million. ONEOK Partners is also exposed to commodity price risk primarily as a result of NGLs in storage, the relative values of the various NGL products to each other, the relative value of NGLs to natural gas and the relative value of NGL purchases at one location and sales at another location, known as basis risk. ONEOK Partners utilizes fixed price physical forward contracts to reduce earnings volatility related to NGL price fluctuations in the storage and optimization activities of its natural gas liquids business. ONEOK Partners has not entered into any financial instruments with respect to its NGL marketing activities. In addition, ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk as its natural gas interstate and intrastate pipelines retain natural gas from its customers for operations or as part of its fee for services provided. When the amount of natural gas consumed in operations by these pipelines differs from the amount provided by its customers, the pipelines must buy or sell natural gas, or store or use natural gas from inventory, which exposes ONEOK Partners to commodity price risk. At December 31, 2010, there were no hedges in place with respect to natural gas price risk from ONEOK Partners natural gas pipeline business. Distribution Our Distribution segment uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of anticipated natural gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect their customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural gas. Gains or losses associated with these derivative instruments are included in, and recoverable through, the monthly purchased gas cost adjustment mechanism. Energy Services Our Energy Services segment is exposed to commodity price risk, basis risk and price volatility arising from natural gas in storage, requirement contracts, asset management contracts and index based purchases and sales of natural gas at various market locations. We minimize the volatility of our exposure to commodity price risk through the use of derivative instruments, which, under certain circumstances, are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. We are also exposed to 63 Table of Contents commodity price risk from fixed price purchases and sales of natural gas, which we hedge with derivative instruments. Both the fixed price purchases and sales and related derivatives are recorded at fair value. Fair Value Component of the Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities The following table sets forth the fair value component of the energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities, excluding $101.1 million and $161.5 million of net assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, from derivative instruments declared as either fair value or cash flow hedges for the periods indicated: Fair Value Component of Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities (Thousands of dollars) Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at January 1, 2009 $ 3,656 Derivatives reclassified or otherwise settled during the period (15,112 ) Fair value of new derivatives entered into during the period 3,481 Other changes in fair value 10,700 Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2009 2,725 Derivatives reclassified or otherwise settled during the period (7,494 ) Fair value of new derivatives entered into during the period 31,817 Other changes in fair value (18,607 ) Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2010 (a) $ 8,441 (a) The maturities of derivatives are based on injection and withdrawal periods from April through March, which is consistent with our business strategy. The maturities are as follows: $2.5 million matures through March 2011 and $5.9 million matures through March 2015. The change in the net fair value of derivatives outstanding includes the effect of settled energy contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of market movements on the fair value of energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities. For further discussion of fair value measurements and trading activities and assumptions used in our trading activities, see the Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies section of Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Also, see Notes B and C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. VAR Disclosure of Commodity Price Risk We measure commodity price risk in our Energy Services segment using a VAR methodology, which estimates the expected maximum loss of our portfolio over a specified time horizon within a given confidence interval. Our VAR calculations are based on the Monte Carlo approach. The quantification of commodity price risk using VAR provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance and to determine risk thresholds. The use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions, including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation. &# 160;Historical data is used to estimate our VAR with more weight given to recent data, which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements. Other assumptions include a distribution of prices and historical data to calculate volatility and price correlations. We rely on VAR to determine the potential reduction in the portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period. While management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable, no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating VAR. Different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different VAR estimates. Our VAR exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized due to adverse commodity price movements in our Energy Services segments portfolio of derivative financial instruments, physical commodity contracts, leased transport, storage capacity contracts and natural gas in storage. A one day time horizon and a 95 percent confidence level are used in our VAR data. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the VAR calculation based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices, operating exposures and timing thereof, and the changes in our derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and natural gas in storage. VAR information should be evaluated in light of these assumptions and the methodologys other limitations. 64 Table of Contents The potential impact on our future earnings, as measured by VAR, was $2.9 million and $5.4 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The following table sets forth the average, high and low VAR calculations for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, Value at Risk 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Average $ 5.5 $ 8.0 High $ 9.6 $ 14.1 Low $ 2.3 $ 4.6 Our VAR calculation includes derivatives, executory storage and transportation agreements and their related hedges. The variations in the VAR data are reflective of market volatility and changes in our portfolio during the year. The decrease in average VAR for 2010, compared with 2009, was due primarily to higher correlations between regional locations and a decrease in natural gas prices and volatility. Our VAR calculation uses historical prices, placing more emphasis on the most recent price movements. We calculate the VAR on our mark to market derivative positions, which reflects the risk associated with derivatives whose change in fair value will impact current period earnings. VAR associated with these derivative positions was not material during 2010 or 2009. To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably. As a result, we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position. INTEREST RATE RISK General We are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the normal course of business. We manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps. Fixed rate swaps may be used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates. Floating rate swaps may be used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates. At December 31, 2010, the interest rate on all of ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners long term debt was fixed, and neither ONEOK nor ONEOK Partners had any interest rate swaps. COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK ONEOK and ONEOK Partners assess the creditworthiness of their counterparties on an ongoing basis and require security, including prepayments and other forms of collateral, when appropriate. 65 Table of Contents
