ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS The following discussion highlights some of our planned activities, recent achievements and significant issues affecting us. Please refer to the Financial Results and Operating Information, and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and our consolidated financial statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Growth Projects Drilling rig counts are higher compared with 2010, and related development activities continue to progress in many regions of ONEOK Partners operations. Increasing natural gas and NGL production resulting from these activities and higher petrochemical industry demand for NGL products have required additional capital investments to increase the capacity of the infrastructure to bring these commodities from supply basins to market. In response to this increased production and demand for NGL products, ONEOK Partners is investing approximately $2.7 billion to $3.3 billion in capital projects to meet the needs of oil and natural gas producers in the Bakken Shale, the Cana Woodford Shale, the Granite Wash and Mississippian Lime areas, and to provide additional NGL infrastructure in the Rocky Mountain, Mid Continent and Gulf Coast regions that will enhance its ability to distribute NGL products to meet the increasing petrochemical industry and NGL export demand. When completed, these projects are anticipated to provide additional earnings and cash flows. See discussion of ONEOK Partners growth projects in the Financial Results and Operating Information section for our ONEOK Partners segment. Stock Repurchase Program In 2011, we repurchased approximately 4.3 million shares of our common stock for approximately $300 million pursuant to an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. This stock repurchase was part of our three year stock repurchase program to buy up to $750 million of our common stock that was authorized by our Board of Directors in October 2010. 40 Table of Contents Dividends/Distributions During 2011, we paid dividends totaling $2.16 per share, an increase of approximately 18.7 percent over the $1.82 per share paid during 2010. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.61 per share ($2.44 per share on an annualized basis) in January 2012, an increase of approximately 17.3 percent over the $0.52 declared in January 2011. During 2011, ONEOK Partners paid cash distributions totaling $2.325 per unit, an increase of approximately 4.3 percent over the $2.23 per unit paid during 2010. ONEOK Partners paid total cash distributions to us in 2011 of $333 million, which includes $197 million resulting from our limited partner interest and $136 million related to our general partner interest. A cash distribution from ONEOK Partners of $0.61 per unit ($2.44 per unit on an annualized basis) was declared in January 2012, an increase of approximately 7.0 percent over the $0.57 declared in January 2011. Credit Agreements In April 2011, ONEOK entered into the ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement, which is a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in April 2016. In August 2011, ONEOK Partners entered into the ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement, which is a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in August 2016. Debt Issuance and Maturities In January 2011, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of $1.3 billion of senior notes, consisting of $650 million of 3.25 percent senior notes due 2016 and $650 million of 6.125 percent senior notes due 2041. The net proceeds from the offering of approximately $1.28 billion were used to repay amounts outstanding under ONEOK Partners commercial paper program, to repay $225 million of ONEOK Partners senior notes that matured in March 2011 and for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures. In 2011, ONEOK repaid $400 million of maturing senior notes and redeemed $90.5 million of 6.4 percent senior notes with available cash and short term borrowings. In January 2012, we completed an underwritten public offering of $700 million of 4.25 percent senior notes due 2022. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, of approximately $693.9 million were used to repay amounts outstanding under our $1.2 billion commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes, which may include one or more of the following: the repurchase of our common stock, the purchase of additional common units of ONEOK Partners and the payment of dividends. Unit Split In July 2011, ONEOK Partners completed a two for one split of our common and Class B units by a distribution of one unit for each unit outstanding and held by unitholders of record on June 30, 2011. In July 2011, ONEOK Partners partnership agreement was amended to adjust the formula for distributing available cash among the general partner and limited partners to reflect the unit split. As a result of this unit split, we have adjusted all unit and per unit amounts contained herein to be presented on a post split basis. Stock Split On February 15, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a two for one split of our common stock, subject to shareholder approval of a proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock to 600 million from 300 million. The proposal will be voted on at our 2012 annual meeting of shareholders on May 23, 2012. Retail Marketing Sale In December 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell ONEOK Energy Marketing Company to Constellation Energy Group, Inc. for $22.5 million plus working capital. The transaction closed on February 1, 2012. As a result, we expect to recognize a pre tax gain of approximately $20 million to $23 million in the first quarter of 2012. The financial information of ONEOK Energy Marketing Company is reflected as discontinued operations in this Annual Report. All prior periods presented have been recast to reflect the discontinued operations. 41 Table of Contents FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATING INFORMATION Consolidated Operations Selected Financial Results The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Financial Results 2011 2010 2009 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Revenues $ 14,805.8 $ 12,678.8 $ 10,805.8 $ 2,127.0 17 % $ 1,873.0 17 % Cost of sales and fuel 12,425.4 10,616.6 8,807.8 1,808.8 17 % 1,808.8 21 % Net margin 2,380.4 2,062.2 1,998.0 318.2 15 % 64.2 3 % Operating costs 908.3 830.9 831.0 77.4 9 % (0.1 ) (0 %) Depreciation and amortization 312.2 307.2 288.9 5.0 2 % 18.3 6 % Gain (loss) on sale of assets (1.0 ) 18.6 4.8 (19.6 ) * 13.8 * Operating income $ 1,158.9 $ 942.7 $ 882.9 $ 216.2 23 % $ 59.8 7 % Equity earnings from investments $ 127.2 $ 101.9 $ 72.7 $ 25.3 25 % $ 29.2 40 % Interest expense $ (297.0 ) $ (292.2 ) $ (300.8 ) $ 4.8 2 % $ (8.6 ) (3 %) Net income $ 759.7 $ 541.3 $ 491.2 $ 218.4 40 % $ 50.1 10 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 399.2 $ 206.7 $ 185.8 $ 192.5 93 % $ 20.9 11 % Net income attributable to ONEOK $ 360.6 $ 334.6 $ 305.5 $ 26.0 8 % $ 29.1 10 % Capital expenditures $ 1,336.1 $ 582.7 $ 791.2 $ 753.4 * $ (208.5 ) (26 %) * Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 2011 vs. 2010 NGL and condensate prices were higher while natural gas prices decreased during 2011, compared with 2010. These changes in commodity prices had a direct impact on our revenues and cost of sales and fuel. Operating income increased 23 percent in 2011 reflecting higher results from our ONEOK Partners segment, offset partially by lower operating income from our Distribution and Energy Services segments. Our ONEOK Partners segments operating income significantly increased due primarily to more favorable NGL location differentials and higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated, offset partially by the deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline in September 2010 in its natural gas liquids business and lower natural gas transportation margins due to narrower natural gas price location differentials in its natural gas pipelines business. Our Natural Gas Distribution segments operating income decreased 12 percent in 2011 due to increased operating costs. Our Energy Services segments operating income decreased significantly in 2011 due primarily to lower transportation margins and storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities. Operating costs increased in 2011 due primarily to higher short term incentive and share based compensation and other labor and benefit costs for all segments and higher materials and outside services expenses in our ONEOK Partners segment. Gain (loss) on sale of assets decreased from 2010, which reflected a $16.3 million gain on the sale of a 49 percent interest of Overland Pass Pipeline Company. Equity earnings from investments increased in 2011, compared with the same period last year, due to the impact of accounting for Overland Pass Pipeline Company as an equity method investment beginning in September 2010 and increased contracted capacity on Northern Border Pipeline. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, primarily reflects the portion of ONEOK Partners that we do not own and reflects higher earnings in our ONEOK Partners segment during 2011. Capital expenditures increased during 2011 due primarily to the growth projects in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids businesses. 42 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Commodity prices were generally higher during 2010, compared with 2009, which had a direct impact on our revenues and cost of sales and fuel. Our operating results include the benefits from a full year of ONEOK Partners more than $2.0 billion of completed growth projects that were placed in service in 2009. Operating income increased 7 percent in 2010, when compared with 2009, reflecting higher NGL volumes, higher contracted natural gas transportation capacity, an increase in natural gas processing volumes, higher natural gas and NGL storage margins and a gain on the sale of a 49 percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company in our ONEOK Partners segment. These increases were offset partially by ONEOK Partners lower NGL optimization margins. Our Distribution segment benefited from new rates in Oklahoma that increased fixed fees and lowered our volumetric sensitivity, providing more consistent revenues each month. Our Energy Services segments results were consistent with the prior year, with higher realized seasonal storage price differentials and marketing margins offset by lower realized Mid Continent to Gulf Coast transportation margins and lower premium services margins. Operating costs increased due primarily to the recognition of previously deferred integrity management costs in our Natural Gas Distribution segment that are now being recovered through rates, offset partially by lower than estimated ad valorem taxes in our ONEOK Partners segment and lower legal related costs in our Energy Services segment. Our results were also favorably impacted by increased equity earnings from investments in our ONEOK Partners segment. The overall increase was due primarily to increased contracted capacity on Northern Border Pipeline, which benefited from wider natural gas price differentials between the markets it serves, and as a result of accounting for ONEOK Partners 50 percent investment in Overland Pass Pipeline Company as an equity investment beginning September 2010. More information regarding our results of operations is provided in the following discussion of operating results for each of our segments. ONEOK Partners Growth Projects Natural gas gathering and processing business ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business is investing approximately $950 million to $1.1 billion in growth projects in the Williston Basin and Cana Woodford Shale areas that will enable ONEOK Partners to meet the rapidly growing needs of crude oil and natural gas producers in those areas. Williston Basin Processing Plants and related projects ONEOK Partners projects in this basin include three 100 MMcf/d natural gas processing facilities: the Garden Creek plant in eastern McKenzie County, North Dakota, and the Stateline I and II plants in western Williams County, North Dakota. ONEOK Partners has multi year supply commitments and acreage dedications for all the capacity of the Garden Creek and Stateline I plants and for approximately 75 percent of the Stateline II plants capacity. In addition, ONEOK Partners will expand and upgrade its existing gathering and compression infrastructure and add new well connections associated with these plants. The Garden Creek plant, which was placed in service in December 2011, and related infrastructure projects are expected to cost approximately $350 million to $415 million, excluding AFUDC. The Stateline I plant, which is expected to be in service by the third quarter of 2012, and related infrastructure projects are expected to cost approximately $300 million to $355 million, excluding AFUDC. The Stateline II plant, which is expected to be in service during the first half of 2013, and related infrastructure projects are expected to cost approximately $260 million to $305 million, excluding AFUDC. Horizontal wells drilled in the Williston Basin are economically justified by producers primarily by crude oil economics. Accordingly, ONEOK Partners growth in this area is expected to shift our supply exposure from natural gas production economics toward crude oil production economics. In addition, ONEOK Partners expects its commodity price exposure to increase particularly to NGLs and natural gas, as equity volumes increase under its POP contracts with its customers in the Williston Basin. Cana Woodford Shale projects In 2010, ONEOK Partners completed projects totaling approximately $38 million in the Cana Woodford Shale development in Oklahoma, which included the connection of its western Oklahoma natural gas gathering system to its Maysville natural gas processing facility in central Oklahoma, as well as new well connections to gather and process additional Cana Woodford Shale natural gas volumes. In both the Williston Basin and Cana Woodford Shale project areas, nearly all of the new gas production is from horizontally drilled and completed wells. These wells tend to produce at higher initial volumes; however, they generally have higher initial decline rates than conventional vertical wells, but the decline curves flatten out. These wells are expected to have long lasting reserves. ONEOK Partners expects the routine growth capital needed to connect to new wells and expand its infrastructure to be higher compared with its previous experience. 43 Table of Contents Natural gas liquids business The growth strategy in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business is focused around the oil and natural gas drilling activity in shale and other resource plays from the Rocky Mountain region through the Mid Continent region down into Texas. Increasing natural gas and NGL production resulting from this activity and higher petrochemical industry demand for NGL products have required ONEOK Partners to make additional capital investments to increase the capacity of its infrastructure to bring these commodities from supply basins to market. ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business is investing approximately $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion through 2014. This investment will accommodate the gathering and fractionation of growing NGL supplies from the shale and other resource plays across ONEOK Partners asset base and alleviate infrastructure constraints between the Mid Continent and Texas Gulf Coast regions that will enhance its ability to distribute NGL products to meet the increasing petrochemical industry and NGL export demand in the Gulf Coast. ONEOK Partners supply commitments from producers and natural gas processors associated with these growth projects will provide incremental and long term fee based earnings to its NGL business. Over time, these growing fee based volumes will fill a portion of the capacity used in 2011 to capture the price differentials between the Mid Continent and Gulf Coast market centers. In addition, we believe the price differentials between the Mid Continent and Gulf Coast market centers will narrow over the long term as new fractionators and pipelines, including ONEOK Partners MB 2 fractionator and Sterling III pipeline, begin to alleviate constraints impacting NGL prices and the location price differential between the two market centers. Sterling III Pipeline ONEOK Partners plans to build a 570 plus mile natural gas liquids pipeline, the Sterling III Pipeline, which will have the flexibility to transport either unfractionated NGLs or NGL products from the Mid Continent to the Texas Gulf Coast. The Sterling III Pipeline will traverse the NGL rich Woodford Shale that is currently under development, as well as provide transportation capacity for the growing NGL production from the Cana Woodford Shale and Granite Wash areas, where the pipeline can gather unfractionated NGLs from the new natural gas processing plants that are being built as a result of increased drilling activity in these areas. The Sterling III Pipeline will have an initial capacity to transport up to 193 MBbl/d of production from ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids infrastructure at Medford, Oklahoma, to its storage and fractionation facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas. ONEOK Partners has multi year supply commitments from producers and natural gas processors for approximately 75 percent of the pipelines capacity. Additional pump stations could expand the capacity of the pipeline to 250 MBbl/d. Following the receipt of all necessary permits and the acquisition of rights of way, construction is scheduled to begin in 2013, with an expected completion late in the same year. The investment also includes reconfiguring its existing Sterling I and II Pipelines, which currently distribute NGL products between the Mid Continent and Gulf Coast NGL market centers, to transport either unfractionated NGLs or NGL products. The project costs for the new pipeline and reconfiguring projects are estimated to be $610 million to $810 million, excluding AFUDC. MB 2 fractionator ONEOK Partners plans to construct a 75 MBbl/d fractionator, MB 2, near ONEOK Partners storage facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has approved the permit application to build this fractionator. Construction of the MB 2 fractionator began in June 2011 and is expected to be completed in mid 2013. The cost of the MB 2 fractionator is estimated to be $300 million to $390 million, excluding AFUDC. ONEOK Partners has multi year supply commitments from producers and natural gas processors for all of the fractionators capacity. The fractionator can be expanded to 125 MBbl/d to accommodate additional NGL volumes from the Arbuckle Pipeline and the Sterling I, II and III pipelines. Bakken Pipeline and related projects ONEOK Partners plans to build a 525 to 615 mile natural gas liquids pipeline, the Bakken Pipeline, to transport unfractionated NGLs from the Williston Basin to the Overland Pass Pipeline. The Bakken Pipeline initially will have the capacity to transport up to 60 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGL production and can be expanded to 110 MBbl/d with additional pump stations. The unfractionated NGLs will then be delivered to ONEOK Partners existing natural gas liquids fractionation and distribution infrastructure in the Mid Continent. Project costs for the new pipeline are estimated to be $450 million to $550 million, excluding AFUDC. NGL supply commitments for the Bakken Pipeline will be anchored by NGL production from ONEOK Partners natural gas processing plants in the Williston Basin. Following receipt of all necessary permits, construction of the 12 inch diameter pipeline is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2012 and be in service during the first half of 2013. The unfractionated NGLs from the Bakken Pipeline and other supply sources under development in the Rocky Mountain region will require installing additional pump stations and expanding existing pump stations on the Overland Pass Pipeline, in which ONEOK Partners owns a 50 percent equity interest. These additions and expansions will increase the capacity of Overland Pass Pipeline to 255 MBbl/d. ONEOK Partners anticipated share of the costs for this project is estimated to be $35 million to $40 million, excluding AFUDC. 44 Table of Contents Bushton Fractionator Expansion To accommodate the additional volume from the Bakken Pipeline, ONEOK Partners is investing $110 million to $140 million, excluding AFUDC, to expand and upgrade its existing fractionation capacity at Bushton, Kansas, increasing its capacity to 210 MBbl/d from 150 MBbl/d. This project is expected to be in service during the fourth quarter of 2012. Cana Woodford Shale and Granite Wash projects ONEOK Partners plans to invest approximately $197 million to $257 million, excluding AFUDC, in its existing Mid Continent infrastructure, primarily in the Cana Woodford Shale and Granite Wash areas. These investments will expand ONEOK Partners ability to transport unfractionated NGLs from these Mid Continent supply areas to fractionation facilities in Oklahoma and Texas and distribute NGL products to the Mid Continent, Gulf Coast and upper Midwest market centers. These investments include constructing more than 230 miles of natural gas liquids pipelines that will expand its existing Mid Continent natural gas liquids gathering system in the Cana Woodford Shale and Granite Wash areas. The pipelines will connect to three new third party natural gas processing facilities that are under construction and to three existing third party natural gas processing facilities that are being expanded. Additionally, ONEOK Partners will install additional pump stations on the Arbuckle Pipeline to increase its capacity to 240 MBbl/d. When completed, these projects are expected to add, through multi year supply contracts, approximately 75 to 80 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGL, to ONEOK Partners existing natural gas liquids gathering systems. These projects are expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 2012 and cost approximately $180 million to $240 million, excluding AFUDC. In 2010, ONEOK Partners invested approximately $17 million to increase the accessibility of new NGL supply to the Arbuckle Pipeline and Mont Belvieu fractionation facilities. Sterling I Pipeline Expansion In 2011, ONEOK Partners installed seven additional pump stations at a cost of approximately $30 million, excluding AFUDC, along its existing Sterling I natural gas liquids distribution pipeline, increasing its capacity by 15 MBbl/d, which is supplied by ONEOK Partners Mid Continent natural gas liquids infrastructure. The Sterling I pipeline transports NGL products from ONEOK Partners fractionator in Medford, Oklahoma, to the Mont Belvieu, Texas, market center. For a discussion of ONEOK Partners capital expenditure financing, see Capital Expenditures in Liquidity and Capital Resources on page 58. Selected Financial Results and Operating Information ONEOK Partners 2011 and 2010 operating results reflect increases in NGL volumes gathered, fractionated and sold in its natural gas liquids business and natural gas volumes processed in the Williston Basin in its natural gas gathering and processing business. ONEOK Partners expects continued development of the reserves in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations in the Williston Basin and in the Cana Woodford Shale and Granite Wash areas in Oklahoma and Texas, as drilling activities increase in these areas. The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for our ONEOK Partners segment for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Financial Results 2011 2010 2009 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Revenues $ 11,322.6 $ 8,675.9 $ 6,474.5 $ 2,646.7 31 % $ 2,201.4 34 % Cost of sales and fuel 9,745.2 7,531.0 5,355.2 2,214.2 29 % 2,175.8 41 % Net margin 1,577.4 1,144.9 1,119.3 432.5 38 % 25.6 2 % Operating costs 459.4 403.5 411.3 55.9 14 % (7.8 ) (2 %) Depreciation and amortization 177.5 173.7 164.1 3.8 2 % 9.6 6 % Gain (loss) on sale of assets (1.0 ) 18.6 2.7 (19.6 ) * 15.9 * Operating income $ 939.5 $ 586.3 $ 546.6 $ 353.2 60 % $ 39.7 7 % Equity earnings from investments $ 127.2 $ 101.9 $ 72.7 $ 25.3 25 % $ 29.2 40 % Interest expense $ (223.1 ) $ (204.3 ) $ (206.0 ) $ 18.8 9 % $ (1.7 ) (1 %) Capital expenditures $ 1,063.4 $ 352.7 $ 615.7 $ 710.7 * $ (263.0 ) (43 %) * Percentage change is greater than 100 percent. 45 Table of Contents 2011 vs. 2010 Net margin increased due primarily to the following: an increase of $363.6 million in optimization and marketing margins in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business due primarily to the following: an increase of $335.2 million from more favorable NGL price differentials and additional fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities between the Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, NGL market centers; and an increase of $28.4 from higher marketing volumes and more favorable margins on NGL products marketed; an increase of $32.6 million due to higher net realized NGL and condensate prices in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business; an increase of $32.5 million from higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated in Texas and the Mid Continent and Rocky Mountain regions, excluding the impact of the September 2010 deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline Company, and contract renegotiations for higher fees associated with ONEOK Partners NGL exchange services activities, offset partially by higher costs associated with NGL volumes fractionated by third parties in its natural gas liquids business; an increase of $26.4 million related to higher isomerization margins resulting from wider price differentials between normal butane and iso butane and higher isomerization volumes in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business; an increase of $19.4 million due to higher natural gas volumes processed in the Williston Basin and western Oklahoma resulting from increased drilling activity, offsetting reduced drilling activity in certain parts of Kansas and weather related outages during the first quarter in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business; an increase of $12.4 million due to higher storage margins as a result of contract renegotiations in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business; and an increase of $8.8 million due to favorable changes in contract terms in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business; offset partially by a decrease of $42.8 million due to the deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline Company, which is now accounted for under the equity method in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business; a decrease of $12.5 million from lower natural gas transportation margins due to narrower natural gas price location differentials that decreased contracted transportation capacity on Midwestern Gas Transmission and interruptible transportation volumes across ONEOK Partners pipelines in its natural gas pipelines business; and a decrease of $8.2 million due to lower natural gas volumes gathered as a result of continued production declines and reduced drilling activity by producers in the Powder River Basin in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business. Operating costs increased due primarily to the following: an increase of $35.7 million in higher labor and employee related costs associated with incentive and benefit plans, which includes higher share based compensation costs resulting from common stock awarded to employees as part of ONEOKs stock award program and the appreciation in ONEOKs share price, affecting all of ONEOK Partners businesses; an increase of $9.4 million from higher materials and outside services expenses associated primarily with scheduled maintenance at fractionation, pipeline and storage facilities in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business; and an increase of $5.0 million due to higher ad valorem taxes associated with the completed capital projects in all of ONEOK Partners businesses; offset partially by a decrease of $5.4 million due to the deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline Company, which is now accounted for under the equity method of accounting in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business. Gain (loss) on sale of assets decreased due to the $16.3 million gain on the sale of a 49 percent interest of Overland Pass Pipeline Company recorded in 2010. Equity earnings include Overland Pass Pipeline Company in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business, which it began accounting for under the equity method of accounting in September 2010. Equity earnings from investments increased due primarily to increased contracted capacity on Northern Border Pipeline in ONEOK Partners natural gas pipelines business. Northern Border Pipeline benefited from wider natural gas price location differentials between the markets it serves, which resulted in a significant increase in its capacity being sold in 2011. Substantially all of Northern Border Pipelines long haul capacity has been contracted through March 2013. 46 Table of Contents Capital expenditures increased due primarily to the growth projects in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids businesses. Previously, ONEOK Partners had a Processing and Services Agreement with us and OBPI, under which we contracted for all of OBPIs rights, including all of the capacity of the Bushton Plant, reimbursing OBPI for all costs associated with the operation and maintenance of the Bushton Plant and its obligations under equipment leases covering portions of the Bushton Plant. In April 2011, pursuant to its rights under the Processing and Services Agreement, ONEOK Partners directed OBPI to give notice of intent to exercise the purchase option for the leased equipment pursuant to the terms of the equipment leases. On June 30, 2011, through a series of transactions, we sold OBPI to ONEOK Partners, and OBPI closed the purchase option and terminated the equipment leases. The total amount paid by ONEOK Partners to complete the transactions was approximately $94.2 million, which included the reimbursement to us of obligations related to the Processing and Services Agreement. 2010 vs. 2009 Net margin increased due primarily to the following: an increase of $51.4 million due to higher NGL volumes gathered, fractionated and transported, primarily associated with the completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline and Piceance and D J Basin lateral pipelines, as well as new NGL supply connections in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business; an increase of $14.4 million due to higher storage margins, primarily as a result of contract renegotiations in ONEOK Partners natural gas pipelines and natural gas liquids businesses; an increase of $9.1 million due to increased Williston Basin volumes in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business; and an increase of $8.7 million from higher natural gas transportation margins from an increase in contracted capacity on Midwestern Gas Transmission, Viking Gas Transmissions Fargo lateral pipeline and the incremental margin from the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension project in ONEOK Partners natural gas pipelines business; offset partially by a decrease of $34.7 million related to lower optimization margins due to limited NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities between the Mid Continent and Gulf Coast NGL market centers until September 2010 and less favorable NGL price differentials in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business; a decrease of $7.8 million due to decreased volumes processed and sold in western Oklahoma and Kansas as a result of natural production declines, operational outages and a period of ethane rejection in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business; a decrease of $6.5 million from selling ONEOK Partners Lehman Brothers bankruptcy claims in 2009; and a decrease of $6.3 million due to lower natural gas volumes gathered as a result of natural production declines and reduced drilling activity by its customers in the Powder River Basin in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business. Operating costs decreased due primarily to a decrease of $8.2 million due to lower than estimated ad valorem taxes associated with ONEOK Partners capital projects completed in 2009 in its natural gas liquids business. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of ONEOK Partners capital projects completed in 2009 in its natural gas liquids and natural gas pipelines businesses, offset partially by the deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline Company in the third quarter of 2010 in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business. Gain (loss) on sale of assets increased due primarily to the gain on sale of a 49 percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business. Equity earnings from investments increased due primarily to increased contracted capacity on Northern Border Pipeline due to wider natural gas price differentials in ONEOK Partners natural gas pipelines business and equity earnings from ONEOK Partners investment in Overland Pass Pipeline Company, which was deconsolidated in September 2010. 47 Table of Contents Selected Operating Information The following table sets forth selected operating information for our ONEOK Partners segment for the periods indicated: Operating Information 2011 2010 2009 Natural gas gathering and processing business (a) Natural gas gathered (BBtu/d) 1,030 1,067 1,123 Natural gas processed (BBtu/d) (b) 713 674 658 NGL sales (MBbl/d) 48 44 43 Residue gas sales (BBtu/d) 317 286 291 Realized composite NGL net sales price ($/gallon) (c) $ 1.08 $ 0.94 $ 0.90 Realized condensate net sales price ($/Bbl) (c) $ 82.56 $ 63.81 $ 78.35 Realized residue gas net sales price ($/MMBtu) (c) $ 5.47 $ 5.58 $ 3.55 Realized gross processing spread ($/MMBtu) (c) $ 8.17 $ 6.41 $ 6.63 Natural gas pipelines business (a) Natural gas transportation capacity contracted (MDth/d) 5,373 5,616 5,507 Transportation capacity subscribed 83 % 87 % 86 % Average natural gas price Mid Continent region ($/MMBtu) $ 3.88 $ 4.17 $ 3.28 Natural gas liquids business NGL sales (MBbl/d) 497 457 408 NGLs fractionated (MBbl/d) (d) 537 512 481 NGLs transported gathering lines (MBbl/d) (a) (e) 436 440 372 NGLs transported distribution lines (MBbl/d) (a) 473 468 459 Conway to Mont Belvieu OPIS average price differential Ethane ($/gallon) $ 0.28 $ 0.10 $ 0.11 (a) For consolidated entities only.

(e) 2010 and 2009 volume information includes 62 and 69 MBbl/d, respectively, related to Overland Pass Pipeline Company, which was deconsolidated in September 2010. 2011 vs. 2010 Natural gas gathered decreased in 2011, compared with 2010, due to continued production declines and reduced drilling activity, primarily in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and certain parts of Kansas, and weather related outages in the first quarter of 2011, offset partially by increased drilling activity in the Williston Basin and western Oklahoma. Natural gas processed and residue gas sales increased in 2011, compared with 2010, due to an increase in drilling activity in the Williston Basin and western Oklahoma, offsetting reduced drilling activity and natural production declines in Kansas and weather related outages in the first quarter of 2011. Natural gas transportation capacity contracted decreased due primarily to lower contracted capacity on Midwestern Gas Transmission due to narrower natural gas price location differentials between the markets we serve. NGLs gathered and fractionated, excluding the impact of the September 2010 deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline Company, increased due primarily to increased throughput through existing connections in Texas and the Mid Continent and Rocky Mountain regions, and new supply connections in the Mid Continent and Rocky Mountain regions. In the second quarter 2011, additional Gulf Coast fractionation capacity became available through our 60 MBbl/d fractionation service agreement with Targa Resources Partners. NGLs transported on distribution lines increased due primarily to increased volumes of NGL products transported on our North System pipeline to Midwest markets and our Sterling I pipeline expansion discussed above. 48 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Natural gas gathered decreased in 2010, compared with 2009, due to continued production declines and reduced drilling activity, primarily in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and certain parts of western Oklahoma and Kansas, offset partially by increased drilling activity in the Williston Basin. Natural gas processed increased during 2010, compared with 2009, due to an increase in drilling activity in the Williston Basin, offsetting reduced drilling activity and natural production declines in Kansas, and reduced drilling activity in certain parts of western Oklahoma. Natural gas transportation capacity contracted increased due primarily to increased capacity on Midwestern Gas Transmission due to a new interconnection with the Rockies Express Pipeline, Viking Gas Transmissions Fargo lateral and Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension projects completed in 2009. NGLs gathered, fractionated and distributed increased primarily due to new connections and increased production associated with the completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline, Piceance Lateral and D J Basin lateral pipelines. ONEOK Partners natural gas pipelines business primarily serves end users, such as natural gas distribution companies and electric generation companies, that require natural gas to operate their businesses regardless of price or location price differentials. The development of shale gas and other resource plays has continued to increase available natural gas supply and has caused natural gas prices to decrease and locational and seasonal price differentials to narrow. As additional supply is developed, ONEOK Partners expects producers to demand incremental services in the future to transport their production to market. The abundance of shale gas supply and new regulations on emissions from coal fired electric generation plants also may increase the demand for our services from electric generation companies if they were to convert to a natural gas fuel source. Conversely, demand from certain customers that are focused on capturing location or seasonal natural gas price differentials may decrease in the future due to narrowing price differentials. Overall, we expect our fee based earnings to remain relatively stable in the future as the development of shale and other resource plays continue. Natural Gas Distribution In December 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell ONEOK Energy Marketing Company to Constellation Energy Group, Inc. for $22.5 million plus working capital. The transaction closed on February 1, 2012. As a result, we expect to recognize a pre tax gain of approximately $20 million to $23 million in the first quarter of 2012. The financial information of ONEOK Energy Marketing Company is reflected as discontinued operations in this Annual Report. All prior periods presented have been recast to reflect the discontinued operations. 49 Table of Contents Selected Financial Results The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for the continuing operations of our Distribution segment for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Financial Results 2011 2010 2009 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Gas sales $ 1,492.5 $ 1,687.4 $ 1,708.8 $ (194.9 ) (12 %) $ (21.4 ) (1 %) Transportation revenues 90.9 91.5 87.6 (0.6 ) (1 %) 3.9 4 % Cost of gas 869.5 1,062.5 1,122.9 (193.0 ) (18 %) (60.4 ) (5 %) Net margin, excluding other revenues 713.9 716.4 673.5 (2.5 ) (0 %) 42.9 6 % Other revenues 37.9 38.5 42.5 (0.6 ) (2 %) (4.0 ) (9 %) Net margin 751.8 754.9 716.0 (3.1 ) (0 %) 38.9 5 % Operating costs 422.0 398.8 384.1 23.2 6 % 14.7 4 % Depreciation and amortization 132.2 131.0 122.6 1.2 1 % 8.4 7 % Gain (loss) on sale of assets 0.5 0 % (0.5 ) (100 %) Operating income $ 197.6 $ 225.1 $ 209.8 $ (27.5 ) (12 %) $ 15.3 7 % Capital expenditures $ 242.6 $ 215.6 $ 157.5 $ 27.0 13 % $ 58.1 37 % The following table sets forth our net margin, excluding other revenues, by type of customer, for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Net Margin, Excluding Other Revenues 2011 2010 2009 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) Gas sales (Millions of dollars) Regulated Residential $ 510.5 $ 509.1 $ 473.8 $ 1.4 0 % $ 35.3 7 % Commercial 105.5 108.9 105.1 (3.4 ) (3 %) 3.8 4 % Industrial 2.4 2.2 2.5 0.2 9 % (0.3 ) (12 %) Wholesale/public authority 4.6 4.7 4.5 (0.1 ) (2 %) 0.2 4 % Net margin on gas sales 623.0 624.9 585.9 (1.9 ) (0 %) 39.0 7 % Transportation margin 90.9 91.5 87.6 (0.6 ) (1 %) 3.9 4 % Net margin, excluding other revenues $ 713.9 $ 716.4 $ 673.5 $ (2.5 ) (0 %) $ 42.9 6 % 2011 vs. 2010 Net margin decreased due primarily to the following: a decrease of $5.9 million from lower sales in Kansas, due to lower consumption by residential and commercial customers due to warmer than normal weather in the first quarter; a decrease of $4.9 million due to expiration of the Integrity Management Program (IMP) rider, which allowed us to recover certain deferred pipeline integrity costs in Oklahoma; offset partially by an increase of $3.3 million from new rates and rider recoveries in Texas; an increase of $2.1 million from customer growth, primarily in Texas; and an increase of $1.7 million from capital recovery mechanisms in Kansas. Operating costs increased due primarily to the following: an increase of $14.7 million in share based compensation costs from common stock awarded to employees as part of ONEOKs stock award program and the appreciation in ONEOKs share price; an increase of $8.1 million of employee related incentive and health benefit costs; and an increase of $3.2 million in pension costs as a result of the annual change in our estimated discount rate. Depreciation and amortization expense increased due primarily to an increase of $6.4 million associated with additional capital expenditures, specifically investments in automated meter reading in Oklahoma, offset partially by a decrease of $4.9 million in regulatory amortization associated with the expiration of the IMP rider, which allowed us to defer recognition of certain pipeline integrity costs in Oklahoma. 50 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Net margin increased due primarily to the following: an increase of $40.1 million from new rates in Oklahoma that increased fixed fees, which lowered our volumetric sensitivity and provides more consistent revenues each month; an increase of $6.5 million from rider recoveries in Oklahoma and ad valorem tax surcharge recoveries in Kansas; an increase of $3.7 million from higher natural gas sales volumes, primarily in the first quarter of 2010, due to colder weather; an increase of $3.4 million from capital recovery mechanisms in Kansas; and an increase of $2.7 million from higher transportation volumes; offset partially by a decrease of $17.4 million from the expiration of the 2009 capital recovery mechanism in Oklahoma, which as a result of our 2009 rate case in Oklahoma, the revenues related to capital recovery are now included in base rates. Operating costs increased due primarily to an increase of $15.5 million related to the recognition of previously deferred IMP costs in Oklahoma that have been approved for recovery in our revenues. Depreciation and amortization expense increased due primarily to an increase of $6.7 million in regulatory amortization associated with revenue rider recoveries. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures program includes expenditures for pipeline integrity, automated meter reading, extending service to new areas, modifications to customer service lines, increasing system capabilities and replacements. It is our practice to maintain and upgrade facilities to ensure safe, reliable and efficient operations. Capital expenditures increased for 2011, compared with 2010, primarily as a result of increased spending on pipeline replacements in Kansas and Texas, and replacements due to highway construction in Oklahoma, offset partially by decreased spending on automated meter reading in Oklahoma. Capital expenditures increased for 2010, compared with 2009, primarily as a result of expenditures related to an investment in automated meter reading in Oklahoma. Selected Operating Information The following tables set forth certain selected information for the regulated operations of our Distribution segment for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, Number of Customers 2011 2010 2009 Residential 1,921,017 1,912,205 1,901,782 Commercial 153,227 153,650 156,337 Industrial 1,248 1,271 1,343 Wholesale/Public Authority 2,730 2,701 2,767 Transportation 11,708 11,308 10,410 Total customers 2,089,930 2,081,135 2,072,639 Years Ended December 31, Volumes (MMcf) 2011 2010 2009 Gas sales Residential 117,969 121,240 120,370 Commercial 33,805 35,223 35,414 Industrial 1,367 1,211 1,208 Wholesale/Public Authority 3,287 12,060 12,705 Total volumes sold 156,428 169,734 169,697 Transportation 203,655 205,692 201,952 Total volumes delivered 360,083 375,426 371,649 Residential and commercial volumes decreased for 2011, compared with 2010, due primarily to warmer temperatures in the first quarter of 2011. Wholesale sales represent contracted gas volumes that exceed the needs of our residential, commercial, and industrial customer base and are available for sale to other parties. Wholesale volumes decreased for 2011, compared with 2010; however, the impact to margins was minimal. 51 Table of Contents Regulatory Initiatives Oklahoma In February 2011, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed its first application related to its performance based rate change mechanism. The application did not seek a modification of customer rates because Oklahoma Natural Gas regulatory return on equity was within the range approved by the OCC. The OCC signed the final order on this filing in July 2011, with no modification to customer rates. In September 2010, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed an application and supporting testimony with the OCC seeking approval of a demand portfolio of conservation and energy efficiency programs and authorizing recovery of costs and performance incentives. A settlement agreement was reached among all the parties and filed at the OCC in February 2011. This agreement allows Oklahoma Natural Gas to pursue the key energy efficiency programs requested in its filing and allows the company to earn up to $1.5 million annually beginning mid 2012 if program objectives are achieved. The filing and settlement agreement were approved by the OCC in May 2011, and billings to customers began in June 2011. Kansas The KCC approved the application from Kansas Gas Service to increase the Gas System Reliability Surcharge by an additional $2.9 million effective January 2012. This surcharge is a capital recovery mechanism that allows for rate adjustment providing recovery and a return on incremental safety related and government mandated capital investments made between rate cases. We expect to file a general rate proceeding with the KCC in mid 2012. Texas In January 2012, the Texas Railroad Commission approved the settlement between Texas Gas Service and the City of El Paso that allows for recovery of 2010 2013 pipeline integrity expenditures and partial recovery of rate case expenses. We do not expect the settlement to have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, Texas Gas Service has made annual filings for interim rate relief under the Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program (GRIP) statute with the cities of Austin, Texas, and surrounding communities in February 2011 and El Paso, Texas, in May 2011 for approximately $1.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively. GRIP is a capital recovery mechanism that allows for an interim rate adjustment providing recovery and a return on incremental capital investments made between rate cases. In May 2011, the city of Austin approved the filing in the amount of $1.5 million, effective in June 2011. In August 2011, the city of El Paso approved the filing in the amount of $1.0 million, effective in August 2011. In the normal course of business, we have filed rate cases and for GRIP and cost of service adjustments in various other Texas jurisdictions to address investments in rate base and changes in expense. General Certain costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process have been capitalized as regulatory assets. Should recovery cease due to regulatory actions, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for recognition and accordingly, a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. There were no write offs of regulatory assets resulting from the failure to meet the criteria for capitalization during 2011, 2010 or 2009. Energy Services Selected Financial Results The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for our Energy Services segment for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Financial Results 2011 2010 2009 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Revenues $ 2,777.2 $ 3,301.2 $ 3,553.6 $ (524.0 ) (16 %) $ (252.4 ) (7 %) Cost of sales and fuel 2,728.5 3,141.5 3,394.0 (413.0 ) (13 %) (252.5 ) (7 %) Net margin 48.7 159.7 159.6 (111.0 ) (70 %) 0.1 0 % Operating costs 24.5 28.4 35.5 (3.9 ) (14 %) (7.1 ) (20 %) Depreciation and amortization 0.4 0.6 0.5 (0.2 ) (33 %) 0.1 20 % Operating income $ 23.8 $ 130.7 $ 123.6 $ (106.9 ) (82 %) $ 7.1 6 % 52 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our margins by activity for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 2011 2010 2009 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Marketing, storage and transportation revenues, gross $ 208.0 $ 342.9 $ 367.7 $ (134.9 ) (39 %) $ (24.8 ) (7 %) Storage and transportation costs 161.2 189.4 211.2 (28.2 ) (15 %) (21.8 ) (10 %) Marketing, storage and transportation, net 46.8 153.5 156.5 (106.7 ) (70 %) (3.0 ) (2 %) Financial trading, net 1.9 6.2 3.1 (4.3 ) (69 %) 3.1 100 % Net margin $ 48.7 $ 159.7 $ 159.6 $ (111.0 ) (70 %) $ 0.1 0 % In accordance with our strategy to better align fixed costs with the current business environment, we reduced our leased transportation capacity in 2011. Our storage and transportation costs decreased 15 percent in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to this transportation capacity reduction. For additional information on transportation capacity refer to Selected Operating Information below. Marketing, storage and transportation revenues, gross, primarily includes marketing, purchases and sales, premium services and the impact of cash flow and fair value hedges and other derivative instruments used to manage our risk associated with these activities. Storage and transportation costs primarily include the cost of leasing capacity, storage injection and withdrawal fees, fuel charges and gathering fees. Risk management and operational decisions have an impact on the net result of our marketing, premium services and storage activities. We evaluate our strategies on an ongoing basis to optimize the value of our contracted assets and to minimize the financial impact of market conditions on the services we provide. Financial trading, net, includes activities that are executed generally using financially settled derivatives. These activities are normally short term in nature, with a focus on capturing short term price volatility. Revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income include financial trading margins, as well as certain physical natural gas transactions with our trading counterparties. Revenues and cost of sales and fuel from such physical transactions are reported on a net basis. 2011 vs. 2010 The factors discussed in Energy Services Narrative Description of the Business included in Item I, Business, of this Annual Report have led to a significant decrease in net margin, including: a decrease of $65.3 million in transportation margins, net of hedging, due primarily to narrower price location differentials and lower hedge settlements in 2011; a decrease of $34.3 million in storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to the following: lower realized seasonal storage price differentials; offset partially by favorable marketing activity and unrealized fair value changes on nonqualifying economic storage hedges; a decrease of $7.3 million in premium services margins, associated primarily with the reduction in the value of the fees collected for these services as a result of low commodity prices and reduced natural gas price volatility in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the first quarter of 2010; and a decrease of $4.3 million in financial trading margins, as low natural gas prices and reduced natural gas price volatility limited our financial trading opportunities. Additionally, our net margin includes $91.1 million in adjustments to natural gas inventory reflecting the lower of cost or market value. Because of the adjustments to our inventory value, we reclassified $91.1 million of deferred gains on associated cash flow hedges into earnings. Operating costs decreased due primarily to a decrease in ad valorem taxes. 2010 vs. 2009 Net margin was relatively unchanged but reflects the following: an increase of $39.7 million in storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to the following: higher realized seasonal storage price differentials and a decrease in storage expense due to the reduction in storage capacity; offset partially by a reduction in storage withdrawals due to decreased natural gas storage capacity under lease; and unfavorable unrealized fair value changes on nonqualifying economic hedge activity and marketing margins; and an increase of $3.1 million in financial trading margins; offset by a decrease of $21.4 million in transportation margins, net of hedging, due primarily to narrower realized Mid Continent to Gulf Coast price differentials; and 53 Table of Contents a decrease of $21.3 million in premium services margins, associated primarily with lower demand fees as a result of lower volatility of natural gas prices, offset partially by the favorable management of customer peaking requirements resulting from warmer weather in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009. Additionally, our net margin includes $58.7 million in adjustments to natural gas inventory reflecting the lower of cost or market value. Because of the adjustments to our inventory value, we reclassified $58.7 million of deferred gains on associated cash flow hedges into earnings. Operating costs decreased due primarily to a decrease in legal related costs and ad valorem taxes. Selected Operating Information The following table sets forth certain selected operating information for our Energy Services segment for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, Operating Information 2011 2010 2009 Natural gas marketed (Bcf) 845 919 1,105 Natural gas gross margin ($/Mcf) $ 0.06 $ 0.18 $ 0.15 Physically settled volumes (Bcf) 1,724 1,874 2,217 Natural gas volumes marketed and physically settled volumes decreased in both 2011 and 2010 due primarily to reduced transportation capacity and lower transported volumes. Transportation capacity in certain markets was not utilized due to the economics of the location differentials as a result of increased supply of natural gas, primarily from shale production and increased pipeline capacity as a result of pipeline construction. Our natural gas in storage at December 31, 2011, was 70.5 Bcf, compared with 63.0 Bcf at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, our total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 75.6 Bcf, compared with 73.6 Bcf at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, our natural gas storage capacity under lease had a maximum withdrawal capability of 2.4 Bcf/d and maximum injection capability of 1.3 Bcf/d. At December 31, 2011, our natural gas transportation capacity was 1.2 Bcf/d, of which 1.1 Bcf/d was contracted under long term natural gas transportation contracts, compared with 1.4 Bcf/d of total capacity and 1.1 Bcf/d of long term capacity at December 31, 2010. Although our intent is to reduce our natural gas storage capacity, we had an increase in the capacity under lease at December 31, 2011, compared with December 31, 2010, as a result of new capacity that was committed to in prior years. Reducing both storage and transportation capacity will continue to be a focus as we continue to attempt to reduce fixed costs because of the current business environment. It is possible that we may recognize charges to our earnings as a result of certain of these actions. CONTINGENCIES Legal Proceedings We are a party to various litigation matters and claims that have arisen in the normal course of our operations. While the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and we are unable to estimate reasonably possible losses, we believe the probable final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Additional information about our legal proceedings is included under Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Annual Report. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES General ONEOK and ONEOK Partners have relied primarily on operating cash flow, commercial paper, bank credit facilities, debt issuances and or the issuance of equity for their liquidity and capital resource requirements. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners fund operating expenses, debt service, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders primarily with operating cash flow. Capital expenditures are funded by short and long term debt, issuances of equity and operating cash flow. We expect to continue to use these sources for our liquidity and capital resource needs. Neither ONEOK nor ONEOK Partners guarantees the debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated parties, and ONEOK does not guarantee the debt or other similar commitments of ONEOK Partners. In 2011, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners accessed the commercial paper markets to meet their short term liquidity needs. Additionally, ONEOK Partners accessed the public debt markets in January 2011 for its long term financing needs. See discussion below under ONEOK Partners Debt Issuance and Maturities for more information. 54 Table of Contents ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners ability to continue to access capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on market conditions and ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners respective financial condition and credit ratings. We anticipate that our cash flow generated from operations, existing capital resources, including proceeds from the issuance of our $700 million 4.25 percent senior notes issued in January 2012, and distributions from ONEOK Partners will enable us to maintain our current and planned level of operations and fund the remainder of our three year, $750 million stock repurchase program. ONEOK Partners anticipates that its cash flow generated from operations, existing capital resources and ability to obtain financing will enable it to maintain its current and planned level of operations. Additionally, ONEOK Partners expects to fund its future capital expenditures with short and long term debt, the issuance of equity and operating cash flows. Capitalization Structure The following table sets forth our consolidated capitalization structure for the periods indicated: December 31, December 31, 2011 2010 Long term debt 56% 52% Total equity 44% 48% Debt (including notes payable) 60% 55% Total equity 40% 45% For purposes of determining compliance with financial covenants in the ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement, which are described below, the debt of ONEOK Partners is excluded. The following table sets forth ONEOKs capital structure, excluding the debt of ONEOK Partners, for the periods indicated: December 31, December 31, 2011 2010 Long term debt 31% 38% ONEOK shareholders equity 69% 62% Debt (including notes payable) 45% 40% ONEOK shareholders equity 55% 60% Stock Repurchase Program In 2011, we repurchased approximately 4.3 million shares of our common stock for approximately $300 million pursuant to an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. The stock repurchase was part of our three year stock repurchase program to buy up to $750 million of our common stock that was authorized by our Board of Directors in October 2010. Cash Management ONEOK and ONEOK Partners each use similar centralized cash management programs that concentrate the cash assets of their operating subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing, transaction costs and bank fees. Both centralized cash management programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of the operating subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the respective consolidated groups. ONEOK Partners operating subsidiaries participate in these programs to the extent they are permitted pursuant to FERC regulations or their operating agreements. Under these cash management programs, depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short term cash surpluses or cash requirements, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners provide cash to their respective subsidiaries or the subsidiaries provide cash to them. Short term Liquidity ONEOKs principal sources of short term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities, quarterly distributions from ONEOK Partners and the issuance of commercial paper. ONEOK Partners principal sources of short term liquidity consist of cash generated from operating activities, the issuance of its commercial paper program and distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates. To the extent commercial paper is unavailable, ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners respective revolving credit agreements may be utilized. ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement In April 2011, ONEOK entered into the five year, $1.2 billion ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement, which replaced the $1.2 billion ONEOK Credit Agreement that was scheduled to expire in July 2011. The ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement, which is scheduled to expire in April 2016, contains certain financial, operational and legal covenants. Among other things, these covenants include maintaining ONEOKs stand alone debt to capital ratio of no more than 67.5 percent at the end of any calendar quarter, limitations on the ratio of indebtedness secured by liens and indebtedness of subsidiaries to consolidated net tangible assets, a requirement that ONEOK maintains the power to control the management and policies of ONEOK Partners, and a limit on new investments in master limited partnerships. 55 Table of Contents The ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants relating to liens, investments, fundamental changes in the nature of ONEOKs businesses, transactions with affiliates, the use of proceeds and a covenant that limits ONEOKs ability to restrict its subsidiaries ability to pay dividends. Under the terms of the ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement, ONEOK may request an increase in the size of the facility to an aggregate of $1.7 billion from $1.2 billion by either commitments from new lenders or increased commitments from existing lenders. The debt covenant calculations in the ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement exclude the debt of ONEOK Partners. Upon breach of certain covenants by ONEOK, amounts outstanding under the ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement may become due and payable immediately. At December 31, 2011, ONEOKs stand alone debt to capital ratio, as defined by the ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement, was 44.4 percent, and ONEOK was in compliance with all covenants under the ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement. The total amount of short term borrowings authorized by ONEOKs Board of Directors is $2.8 billion. At December 31, 2011, ONEOK had $842.0 million of commercial paper outstanding, $2.0 million in letters of credit issued under the ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement and approximately $30.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. ONEOK had approximately $356.0 million of credit available at December 31, 2011, under the ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2011, ONEOK could have issued $3.1 billion of additional short and long term debt under the most restrictive provisions contained in its various borrowing agreements. The ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement is available to repay our commercial paper notes, if necessary. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program reduce the borrowing capacity under the ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement. The ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement contains provisions for an applicable margin rate and an annual facility fee, both of which adjust with changes in our credit rating. Borrowings, if any, will accrue at LIBOR plus 150 basis points, and the annual facility fee is 25 basis points based on our current credit rating. ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement In August 2011, ONEOK Partners entered into the five year, $1.2 billion ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement, which replaced the $1.0 billion ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement that was due to expire in March 2012. The ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement, which is scheduled to expire in August 2016, contains certain financial, operational and legal covenants. Among other things, these covenants include maintaining a ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA, as defined in the ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement, adjusted for all noncash charges and increased for projected EBITDA from certain lender approved capital expansion projects) of no more than 5.0 to 1. If ONEOK Partners consummates one or more acquisitions in which the aggregate purchase price is $25 million or more, the allowable ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA will be increased to 5.5 to 1 for the three calendar quarters following the acquisition. Upon breach of certain covenants by ONEOK Partners in the ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement, if any, may become due and payable immediately. The ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement includes a $100 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and also features an option to request an increase in the size of the facility to an aggregate of $1.7 billion from $1.2 billion by either commitments from new lenders or increased commitments from existing lenders. The ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement is available to repay ONEOK Partners commercial paper notes, if necessary. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program reduce the borrowing capacity under the ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement. The ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement contains provisions for an applicable margin rate and an annual facility fee, both of which adjust with changes in ONEOK Partners credit rating. Borrowings, if any, will accrue at LIBOR plus 130 basis points, and the annual facility fee is 20 basis points based on ONEOK Partners current credit rating. The ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement is guaranteed fully and unconditionally by ONEOK Partners wholly owned subsidiary, ONEOK Partners Intermediate Limited Partnership. Borrowings under the ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement are nonrecourse to ONEOK. The total amount of short term borrowings authorized by the Board of Directors of ONEOK Partners GP, the general partner of ONEOK Partners, is $2.5 billion. At December 31, 2011, ONEOK Partners had no commercial paper outstanding, no letters of credit issued, no borrowings outstanding under the ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement, approximately $35.1 million of cash and $1.2 billion of credit available under the ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2011, ONEOK Partners could have issued $3.5 billion of short and long term debt to meet its liquidity needs under the most restrictive provisions contained in its various borrowing agreements. At December 31, 2011, ONEOK Partners ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA was 2.9 to 1, and ONEOK Partners was in compliance with all covenants under the ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement. 56 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011, the weighted average interest rate on ONEOKs short term debt outstanding was 0.50 percent. The weighted average interest rates for the year ended December 31, 2011, on ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners short term borrowings were 0.29 percent and 0.37 percent, respectively. Based on the forward LIBOR curve, we expect the interest rates on ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners short term borrowings to increase in 2012, compared with interest rates on amounts outstanding at December 31, 2011. Long term Financing In addition to the principal sources of short term liquidity discussed above, ONEOK expects to fund its longer term cash requirements by issuing equity or long term notes. ONEOK Partners expects to fund its longer term cash requirements by issuing common units or long term notes. Other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuance of convertible debt securities, asset securitization and the sale and leaseback of facilities. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners are subject to changes in the debt and equity markets, and there is no assurance they will be able or willing to access the public or private markets in the future. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners may choose to meet their cash requirements by utilizing some combination of cash flows from operations, borrowing under existing commercial paper or credit facilities, altering the timing of controllable expenditures, restricting future acquisitions and capital projects, or pursuing other debt or equity financing alternatives. Some of these alternatives could involve higher costs or negatively affect their respective credit ratings, among other factors. Based on ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners investment grade credit ratings, general financial condition and market expectations regarding their future earnings and projected cash flows, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners believe that they will be able to meet their respective cash requirements and maintain their investment grade credit ratings. ONEOK Debt Issuance In January 2012, we completed an underwritten public offering of $700 million of 4.25 percent senior notes due 2022. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, of approximately $693.9 million were used to repay amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. We will pay interest on the senior notes due 2022 on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2012. ONEOK Debt Repayments In 2011, ONEOK repaid $400 million of maturing senior notes and redeemed $90.5 million of 6.4 percent senior notes with available cash and short term borrowings. ONEOK Debt Covenants The indentures governing ONEOKs senior notes due 2028 (6.5 percent and 6.875 percent) include an event of default upon acceleration of other indebtedness of $15 million or more, and the indentures governing the senior notes due 2015, 2022 and 2035 include an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of $100 million or more. Such events of default would entitle the trustee or the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior notes due 2015, 2022, 2028 and 2035 to declare those senior notes immediately due and payable in full. ONEOK may redeem the senior notes due 2015, 2028 (6.875 percent) and 2035, in whole or in part, at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make whole premium. ONEOK may redeem the senior notes due 2028 (6.5 percent), in whole or in part, at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. ONEOK may redeem its 4.25 percent senior notes due 2022 at a redemption price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, starting three month before the maturity date. Prior to this date, ONEOK may redeem these senior notes on the same basis as its other senior notes due 2015, 2028 (6.875 percent) and 2035. The redemption price will never be less than 100 percent of the principal amount of the respective note plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. ONEOKs senior notes due 2015, 2022, 2028 and 2035 are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with all of ONEOKs existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. ONEOK Partners Debt Issuance and Maturities In January 2011, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of $1.3 billion of senior notes, consisting of $650 million of 3.25 percent senior notes due 2016 and $650 million of 6.125 percent senior notes due 2041. The net proceeds from the offering of approximately $1.28 billion were used to repay amounts outstanding under ONEOK Partners commercial paper program, to repay $225 million of ONEOK Partners senior notes that matured in March 2011 and for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures. ONEOK Partners intends to repay its $350 million of 5.9 percent senior notes that mature in April 2012 with a combination of cash on hand and short term borrowings. ONEOK Partners Debt Covenants The indentures governing ONEOK Partners senior notes include an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of $100 million or more. Such events of default would entitle the trustee or the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of ONEOK Partners outstanding senior notes to declare those senior notes immediately due and payable in full. 57 Table of Contents ONEOK Partners may redeem the senior notes due 2012, 2016 (6.15 percent), 2019, 2036 and 2037, in whole or in part, at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make whole premium. The redemption price will never be less than 100 percent of the principal amount of the respective note plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. ONEOK Partners may redeem its senior notes due 2016 (3.25 percent) and senior notes due 2041 at a redemption price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, starting one month and six months, respectively, before their maturity dates. Prior to these dates, ONEOK Partners may redeem these senior notes on the same terms as its other senior notes. ONEOK Partners senior notes are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with all of ONEOK Partners existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, and structurally subordinate to all of the existing and future debt and other liabilities of any nonguarantor subsidiaries. ONEOK Partners senior notes are nonrecourse to ONEOK. Interest rate Swaps At December 31, 2011, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners had forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $500 million and $750 million, respectively. The purpose of the swaps is to hedge the variability of interest payments on a portion of forecasted debt issuances that may result from changes in the benchmark interest rate before the debt is issued. In January 2012, ONEOK entered into an additional interest rate swap that was designated as a cash flow hedge with a notional amount of $200 million. Upon issuance in January 2012 of our $700 million of 4.25 percent senior notes due 2022, ONEOK settled its swaps and realized a loss of $44.1 million that will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt. Capital Expenditures ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners capital expenditures are financed typically through operating cash flows, short and long term debt and the issuance of equity. Capital expenditures were $1,336.1 million, $582.7 million and $791.2 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, exclusive of acquisitions. Of these amounts, ONEOK Partners capital expenditures were $1,063.4 million, $352.7 million and $615.7 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, exclusive of acquisitions. Capital expenditures for 2011 increased, compared with 2010, due primarily to the growth projects in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids businesses. The following table sets forth our 2012 projected capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC: 2012 Projected Capital Expenditures (Millions of dollars) ONEOK Partners $ 1,969 Natural Gas Distribution 270 Other 32 Total projected capital expenditures $ 2,271 Unconsolidated Affiliates The Overland Pass Pipeline Company limited liability company agreement provides that distributions to Overland Pass Pipeline Companys members are to be made on a pro rata basis according to each members ownership interest. The Overland Pass Pipeline Company Management Committee determines the amount and timing of such distributions. Any changes to, or suspension of, cash distributions from Overland Pass Pipeline Company requires the unanimous approval of the Overland Pass Pipeline Management Committee. Cash distributions are equal to 100 percent of available cash as defined in the limited liability company agreement. The Northern Border Pipeline partnership agreement provides that distributions to Northern Border Pipelines partners are to be made on a pro rata basis according to each partners percentage interest. The Northern Border Pipeline Management Committee determines the amount and timing of such distributions. Any changes to, or suspension of, the cash distribution policy of Northern Border Pipeline requires the unanimous approval of the Northern Border Pipeline Management Committee. Cash distributions are equal to 100 percent of distributable cash flow as determined from Northern Border Pipelines financial statements based upon EBITDA, less interest expense and maintenance capital expenditures. Loans or other advances from Northern Border Pipeline to its partners or affiliates are prohibited under its credit agreement. The Northern Border Pipeline Management Committee has adopted a cash distribution policy related to financial ratio targets and capital contributions. The cash distribution policy defines minimum equity to total capitalization ratios to be used by the Northern Border Pipeline Management Committee to establish the timing and amount of required capital contributions. In addition, any shortfall due to the inability to refinance maturing debt will be funded by capital contributions. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2011, are shown in the table below: ONEOK ONEOK Partners Rating Agency Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Moodys Baa2 Stable Baa2 Stable S&P BBB Stable BBB Stable 58 Table of Contents ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners commercial paper programs are each rated Prime 2 by Moodys and A2 by S&P. ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners credit ratings, which currently are investment grade, may be affected by a material change in financial ratios or a material event affecting the business. The most common criteria for assessment of credit ratings are the debt to capital ratio, business risk profile, pretax and after tax interest coverage, and liquidity. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners currently do not anticipate their respective credit ratings to be downgraded. However, if ONEOKs or ONEOK Partners credit ratings were downgraded, the cost to borrow funds under their respective commercial paper programs and credit agreements would increase, and ONEOK or ONEOK Partners potentially could lose access to the commercial paper market. In the event that ONEOK is unable to borrow funds under its commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in its business, ONEOK would continue to have access to the ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement, which expires in April 2016. In the event that ONEOK Partners is unable to borrow funds under its commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in its business, ONEOK Partners would continue to have access to the ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement, which expires in August 2016. An adverse rating change alone is not a default under the ONEOK 2011 Credit Agreement or the ONEOK Partners 2011 Credit Agreement. Our Energy Services segment relies upon the investment grade rating of ONEOKs senior unsecured long term debt to reduce its collateral requirements. If ONEOKs credit ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to participate in energy marketing and trading activities could be significantly limited. Without an investment grade rating, we may be required to fund margin requirements with our counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments. At December 31, 2011, ONEOK could have been required to fund approximately $5.9 million in margin requirements related to financial contracts upon such a downgrade. A decline in ONEOKs credit rating below investment grade also may impact significantly other business segments. In the normal course of business, ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners counterparties provide secured and unsecured credit. In the event of a downgrade in ONEOKs or ONEOK Partners credit ratings or a significant change in ONEOKs or ONEOK Partners counterparties evaluation of our creditworthiness, ONEOK or ONEOK Partners could be required to provide additional collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments as a condition of continuing to conduct business with such counterparties. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price volatility. Significant fluctuations in commodity prices will impact our overall liquidity due to the impact commodity price changes have on our cash flows from operating activities, including the impact on working capital for NGLs and natural gas held in storage, margin requirements and certain energy related receivables. We believe that ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners available credit and cash and cash equivalents are adequate to meet liquidity requirements associated with commodity price volatility. See discussion beginning on page 68 under Commodity Price Risk in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, for information on our hedging activities. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans Information about our pension and postretirement benefits plans, including anticipated contributions, is included under Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. During 2011, we made contributions of $62.6 million and $11.5 million to our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, respectively. Our 2011 contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are attributable to the 2012 plan year. During the first quarter of 2012, we made a contribution of $60.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan attributable to the 2013 plan year. We do not anticipate that we will be required to make additional material defined benefit pension plan contributions in 2012. We anticipate our 2012 contributions for our postretirement benefit plans will be approximately $10.7 million. The expected 2012 benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be $16.4 million. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS We use the indirect method to prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period. These reconciling items include depreciation and amortization, allowance for equity funds used during construction, gain or loss on sale of assets, equity earnings from investments, distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates, deferred income taxes, share based compensation expense, other amounts, and changes in our assets and liabilities not classified as investing or financing activities. 59 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the changes in cash flows by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,360.0 $ 834.0 $ 1,452.7 Investing activities (1,371.6 ) (134.3 ) (787.8 ) Financing activities 55.4 (698.1 ) (1,145.6 ) Change in cash and cash equivalents 43.8 1.6 (480.7 ) Change in cash and cash equivalents included in discontinued operations (8.2 ) (2.2 ) 15.6 Change in cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations 35.6 (0.6 ) (465.1 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 30.4 30.9 496.0 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 66.0 $ 30.3 $ 30.9 Operating Cash Flows Operating cash flows are affected by earnings from our business activities. Changes in commodity prices and demand for our services or products, whether because of general economic conditions, changes in supply, changes in demand for the end products that are made with our products or increased competition from other service providers, could affect our earnings and operating cash flows. 2011 vs. 2010 Cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $1,397.7 million for 2011, compared with $994.9 million for 2010. The increase was due primarily to changes in net margin and operating expenses discussed in Financial Results and Operating Information on page 42. The changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows $37.7 million for 2011, compared with a decrease of $160.9 million for 2010. The change was due primarily to the collection and payment of trade receivables and payables, resulting from the timing of invoices collected from customers and paid to vendors and suppliers, which vary from period to period; and a decrease in volumes of NGLs in storage in our ONEOK Partners segment in the current period, compared with an increase in volumes in storage in our ONEOK Partners segment in the same period last year. 2010 vs. 2009 Cash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $994.9 million for 2010, compared with $974.3 million for 2009. The increase was due primarily to changes in net margin and operating expenses discussed in Financial Results and Operating Information on page 42. The changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows $160.9 million for 2010, compared with an increase of $478.4 million for 2009, primarily as a result of the impact of commodity prices on our operating assets and liabilities and an increase in volumes of commodities in storage primarily in our Natural Gas Distribution segment and ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities increased for 2011, compared with cash used in investing activities for the same period in 2010, due primarily to ONEOK Partners growth projects in its natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids businesses and the $423.7 million in proceeds ONEOK Partners received from the Overland Pass Pipeline transaction in September 2010. Financing Cash Flows Cash provided by financing activities increased for 2011 compared with 2010. The change is a result of ONEOK Partners January 2011 debt issuance, a portion of the proceeds from which were used to repay ONEOK Partners short term borrowings and the March 2011 maturity of a portion of ONEOK Partners long term debt. The net cash flows provided by these financing activities were offset partially by the repayment of a scheduled maturity of ONEOKs long term debt, ONEOKs $300 million share repurchase in May 2011, increased distributions to noncontrolling interests and increased dividends. Cash used in financing activities decreased for 2010, compared with the 2009, due primarily to decreased borrowings resulting from the completion of ONEOK Partners capital projects in 2009, ONEOK Partners repayment of $250 million of maturing senior notes in 2010, an increase of approximately 12.0 percent in dividends paid during 2010, an increase of approximately 3.0 percent in cash distributions per unit paid to noncontrolling interests and additional ONEOK Partners common units, offset partially by increased net proceeds generated from ONEOK Partners common unit offering in 2010. 60 Table of Contents REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Environmental Matters We are subject to multiple historical and wildlife preservation laws and environmental regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations. Regulated activities include those involving air emissions; storm water and wastewater discharges; handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; hazardous materials transportation; and pipeline and facility construction. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental clearances, registrations, licenses, permits and other approvals. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, licenses and permits may expose us to fines, penalties and or interruptions in our operations that could be material to our results of operations. If a leak or spill of hazardous substances or petroleum products occurs from pipelines or facilities that we own, operate or otherwise use, we could be held jointly and severally liable for all resulting liabilities, including response, investigation and cleanup costs, which could affect materially our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, emission controls required under the Clean Air Act and other similar federal and state laws could require unexpected capital expenditures at our facilities. We cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In May 2010, the EPA finalized the Tailoring Rule that will regulate greenhouse gas emissions at new or modified facilities that meet certain criteria. Affected facilities will be required to review best available control technology, conduct air quality analysis, impact analysis and public reviews with respect to such emissions. The rule was phased in beginning January 2011 and, at current emission threshold levels, will have a minimal impact on our existing facilities. The EPA has stated it will consider lowering the threshold levels over the next five years, which could increase the impact on our existing facilities; however, potential costs, fees or expenses associated with the potential adjustments are unknown. In addition, the EPA issued a proposed rule on air quality standards, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines, also known as RICE NESHAP, with a compliance date in 2013. The rule will require capital expenditures over the next three years for the purchase and installation of new emissions control equipment. We do not expect these expenditures to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Additional information about our environmental matters is included in Environmental and Safety Matters of Item 1, Business and Note Q of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. We cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our expenditures for environmental evaluation, mitigation, remediation and compliance to date have not been significant in relation to our financial position or results of operations, and our expenditures related to environmental matters did not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows during 2011, 2010 and 2009. Financial Markets Legislation The Dodd Frank Act represents a far reaching overhaul of the framework for regulation of United States financial markets. Various regulatory agencies, including the SEC and the CFTC, have proposed regulations for implementation of many of the provisions of the Dodd Frank Act. Although the CFTC has issued final regulations for certain provisions of the Dodd Frank Act, many remain outstanding. In November 2011, the CFTC published final rules on speculative position limits, which we do not expect to impact directly our current risk management practices. In December 2011, the CFTC issued an order that further defers the effective date of the provisions of the Dodd Frank Act that require a rulemaking, such as definitions of certain terms, until the earlier of the effective date of the final rule defining the reference terms or July 16, 2012. Until the remaining final regulations are established, we are unable to ascertain how we may be affected by them. Based on our assessment of the regulations issued to date and those proposed, we expect to be able to continue to participate in financial markets for hedging certain risks inherent in our business, including commodity and interest rate risks; however, the costs of doing so may increase as a result of the new legislation. We also may incur additional costs associated with our compliance with the new regulations and anticipated additional record keeping, reporting and disclosure obligations; however, we do not believe the costs will be material. These requirements could affect adversely market liquidity and pricing of derivative contracts making it more difficult to execute our risk management strategies in the future. Also, the anticipated increased costs of compliance by dealers and counterparties likely will be passed on to customers, which could decrease the benefits of hedging to us and could reduce our profitability and liquidity. Other Several regulatory initiatives impacted the earnings and future earnings potential for our Natural Gas Distribution segment. See discussion of our Natural Gas Distribution segments regulatory initiatives beginning on page 52. 61 Table of Contents IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Information about the impact of new accounting standards is included in Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. ESTIMATES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates. The following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies, which are defined as those estimates and policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters. We have discussed the development and selection of our estimates and critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Fair Value Measurements We define fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We use the market and income approaches to determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities and consider the markets in which the transactions are executed. While many of the contracts in our portfolio are executed in liquid markets where price transparency exists, some contracts are executed in markets for which market prices may exist, but the market may be relatively inactive. This results in limited price transparency that requires managements judgment and assumptions to estimate fair values. Inputs into our fair value estimates include commodity exchange prices, over the counter quotes, volatility, historical correlations of pricing data and LIBOR and other liquid money market instrument rates. We also utilize internally developed basis curves that incorporate observable and unobservable market data. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources, where available. In addition, as prescribed by the income approach, we compute the fair value of our derivative portfolio by discounting the projected future cash flows from our derivative assets and liabilities to present value using interest rate yields to calculate present value discount factors derived from LIBOR, Eurodollar futures and interest rate swaps. We also take into consideration the potential impact on market prices of liquidating positions in an orderly manner and over a reasonable period of time using current market conditions. We consider current market data in evaluating counterparties, as well as our own, nonperformance risk, net of collateral, by using specific and sector bond yields and also monitoring the credit default swap markets. Although we use our best estimates to determine the fair value of the derivative contracts we have executed, the ultimate market prices realized could differ from our estimates, and the differences could be material. The fair value of our forward starting interest rate swaps is determined using financial models that incorporate the implied forward LIBOR yield curve for the same period as the future interest rate swap settlements. Fair Value Hierarchy At each balance sheet date, we utilize a fair value hierarchy to classify fair value amounts recognized or disclosed in our financial statements based on the observability of inputs used to estimate such fair value. The levels of the hierarchy are described below: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Significant observable pricing inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are, either directly or indirectly, observable as of the reporting date. Essentially, this represents inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data; and Level 3 May include one or more unobservable inputs that are significant in establishing a fair value estimate. These unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available and may include our own internal data. Determining the appropriate classification of our fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy requires managements judgment regarding the degree to which market data is observable or corroborated by observable market data. Transfers in and out of Level 3 typically result from derivatives for which fair value is determined based on multiple inputs. If prices change for a particular input from the previous measurement date to the current measurement date, the impact could result in the derivative being moved between Level 2 and Level 3, depending upon managements judgment of the significance of the price change of that particular input to the total fair value of the derivative. 62 Table of Contents For more information on our fair value measurements, fair value sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Note C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. Derivatives, Accounting for Financially Settled Transactions and Risk Management Activities We engage in wholesale energy marketing, trading and risk management activities. We record all derivative instruments at fair value, with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery. Market value changes result in a change in the fair value of our derivative instruments. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effective the hedging instrument is. When possible, we implement effective hedging strategies using derivative instruments that qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. If the derivative instrument does not qualify or is not designated as part of a hedging relationship, then we account for changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings as they occur. Commodity price volatility may have a significant impact on the gain or loss in any given period. To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and condensate prices, we periodically enter into futures, forwards, options or swap transactions in order to hedge anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs and condensate and fuel requirements. Interest rate swaps are also used to manage interest rate risk. Under certain conditions, we designate these derivative instruments as a hedge against our exposure to changes in fair values or cash flow. For hedges of exposure to changes in cash flow, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently recorded to earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness of designated hedges is reported in earnings during the period the ineffectiveness occurs. However, if a derivative instrument is ineligible for hedge accounting or if the cash flow hedge is not properly designated, changes in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recorded currently in earnings. Additionally, if a cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting treatment because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument would be recognized in earnings. For hedges against our exposure in changes in fair value, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings during the period of change together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. We do not believe that changes in our fair value estimates of our derivative instruments have a material impact on our results of operations as the majority of our derivatives are accounted for as hedges for which ineffectiveness is not material. We assess the effectiveness of hedging relationships quarterly by performing an effectiveness test on our hedging relationships to determine whether they are highly effective on a retrospective and prospective basis. Upon election, many of our purchase and sale agreements that result in physical delivery and that otherwise would be required to follow the accounting for derivative instruments qualify as normal purchases and normal sales exceptions and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment. For more information on our derivatives and risk management activities, fair value sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of pricing changes, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion. Impairment of Goodwill and Long Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets We assess our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually as of July 1. There were no impairment charges resulting from our 2011, 2010 or 2009 impairment tests. As part of our impairment test, an initial assessment is made by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the book value, an impairment is indicated, and we must perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment. In the second test, we calculate the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value determined in step one of the assessment. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we will record an impairment charge. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use two generally accepted valuation approaches, an income approach and a market approach, using assumptions consistent with a market participants perspective. Under the income approach, we use anticipated cash flows over a period of years plus a terminal value and discount these amounts to their present value using appropriate discount rates. Under the market approach, we apply multiples to forecasted cash flows. The multiples used are consistent with historical asset transactions. The forecasted cash flows are based on average forecasted cash flows over a period of years. 63 Table of Contents As part of our indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test, we compare the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets with their book values. The fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets is estimated using the market approach. Under the market approach, we apply multiples to forecasted cash flows of the assets associated with our indefinite lived intangible assets. The multiples used are consistent with historical asset transactions. We determined that there were no impairments to our indefinite lived intangible asset in 2011, 2010 or 2009. We assess our long lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If an impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long lived asset. We determined that there were no asset impairments in 2011, 2010 or 2009. For the investments we account for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. Therefore, we periodically reevaluate the amount at which we carry our equity method investments to determine whether current events or circumstances warrant adjustments to our carrying value. We determined that there were no impairments to our investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2011, 2010 or 2009. Our impairment tests require the use of assumptions and estimates such as industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to future impairment charges. See Notes E and F for our goodwill and long lived assets disclosures. Pension and Postretirement Employee Benefits We have defined benefit retirement plans covering certain full time employees. We sponsor welfare plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees who retire with at least five years of service. Our actuarial consultant calculates the expense and liability related to these plans and uses statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, age and employment periods. In determining the projected benefit obligations and costs, assumptions can change from period to period and may result in material changes in the costs and liabilities we recognize. See Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional information. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for our health care plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects. One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Thousands of dollars) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 1,833 $ (1,559 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation $ 17,562 $ (16,079 ) During 2011, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $40.0 million related to our defined benefit pension plans and $19.1 million related to postretirement benefits. We estimate that in 2012, we will record net periodic benefit costs of $47.2 million related to our defined benefit pension plans and $16.0 million related to postretirement benefits. In determining our estimated expenses for 2012, we assumed an 8.25 percent expected return on plan assets and a discount rate of 5.0 percent. A decrease in our expected return on plan assets to 8.0 percent would increase our 2012 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $2.5 million for our defined benefit pension plans and would not have a significant impact on our postretirement benefit plans. A decrease in our assumed discount rate to 4.75 percent would increase our 2012 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately $3.6 million for our defined benefit pension plans and would not have a significant impact on our postretirement benefit plans. During 2011, we made contributions of $62.6 million and $11.5 million to our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, respectively. In 2011, all contributions to our defined benefit pension plans were attributable to the 2012 plan year. During the first quarter of 2012, we made a contribution of $60.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan attributable to the 2013 plan year; we do not anticipate that we will be required to make additional material defined benefit pension plan contributions in 2012. We anticipate our 2012 contributions for our postretirement benefit plans will be approximately $10.7 million. 64 Table of Contents Contingencies Our accounting for contingencies covers a variety of business activities, including contingencies for legal and environmental exposures. We accrue these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated. We base our estimates on currently available facts and our assessments of the ultimate outcome or resolution. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than the completion of a remediation feasibility study. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. Our expenditures for environmental evaluation, mitigation, remediation and compliance to date have not been significant in relation to our financial position or results of operations, and our expenditures related to environmental matters had no material effect on earnings or cash flows during 2011, 2010 and 2009. Actual results may differ from our estimates resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on earnings. See Note Q of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of contingencies.

Interest payments on debt Interest expense is calculated by multiplying long term debt by the respective coupon rates, adjusted for active swaps. Operating leases Our operating leases include leases for office space, pipeline equipment and vehicles. Firm transportation and storage contracts We are party to fixed price contracts for firm transportation and storage capacity. However, the costs associated with our Natural Gas Distribution segments contracts that are recovered through rates as allowed by the applicable regulatory agency are excluded from the table above. Financial and physical derivatives These are obligations arising from our fixed and variable price purchase commitments for financial and physical commodity derivatives and interest rate swaps. However, the commitments associated with our Distribution segments contracts are recovered through rates as allowed by the applicable regulatory agency and are excluded from the table above. Estimated future variable price purchase commitments are based on market information at December 31, 2011. Actual future variable price purchase commitments may vary depending on market prices at the time of delivery. Not included in these amounts are offsetting cash inflows from our ONEOK Partners and Energy Services segments product sales and net positive settlements. As market information changes daily and is potentially volatile, these values may change 65 Table of Contents significantly. Additionally, product sales may require additional purchase obligations to fulfill sales obligations that are not reflected in these amounts. Employee benefit plans Employee benefit plans include our anticipated contribution to maintain the minimum required funding level to our pension and postretirement benefit plans for 2012. See Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for discussion of our employee benefit plans. Purchase commitments, rights of way and other Purchase commitments include commitments related to ONEOK Partners growth capital expenditures and other rights of way and contractual commitments. Purchase commitments exclude commodity purchase contracts, which are included in the Financial and physical derivatives amounts.

Other than as required under securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or change in circumstances, expectations or otherwise. 67 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk Policy and Oversight We control the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibilities for our risk management limits and policies. Our risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price and credit risk management, and marketing and trading activities. The committee also monitors risk metrics including value at risk (VAR) and mark to market losses. We have a risk control group that is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies and procedures and monitoring certain risk metrics. Key risk control activities include risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics. Our exposure to market risk discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity prices. Our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in interest rates or commodity prices and the timing of transactions. COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to commodity price risk and the impact of market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. Commodity price risk refers to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in energy prices. To minimize the risk from market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, we use commodity derivative instruments such as futures, physical forward contracts, swaps and options to manage commodity price risk associated with existing or anticipated purchase and sale agreements, existing physical natural gas in storage and basis risk. ONEOK Partners ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of receiving commodities in exchange for its natural gas gathering and processing services. To a lesser extent, ONEOK Partners is exposed to the relative price differential between NGLs and natural gas, or the gross processing spread, with respect to its keep whole contracts. ONEOK Partners is also exposed to the risk of location price differentials and the cost of third party transportation to various market locations. As part of ONEOK Partners hedging strategy, ONEOK Partners uses commodity fixed price physical forwards and derivative contracts, including NYMEX based futures and over the counter swaps, to minimize earnings volatility in its natural gas gathering and processing business related to natural gas, NGL and condensate price fluctuations. ONEOK Partners reduces its gross processing spread exposure through a combination of physical and financial hedges. ONEOK Partners utilizes a portion of its percent of proceeds equity natural gas as an offset, or natural hedge, to an equivalent portion of its keep whole shrink requirements. This has the effect of converting ONEOK Partners gross processing spread risk to NGL commodity price risk, and ONEOK Partners then uses financial instruments to hedge the sale of NGLs. As of December 31, 2011, ONEOK Partners had $33.7 million of commodity related derivative assets and $3.8 million of commodity related derivative liabilities, excluding the impact of netting. The following tables set forth ONEOK Partners hedging information for the periods indicated, as of February 20, 2012: Year Ending December 31, 2012 Volumes Hedged (a) Average Price Percentage Hedged NGLs (Bbl/d) 8,544 $ 1.24 / gallon 72% Condensate (Bbl/d) 1,818 $ 2.43 / gallon 73% Total (Bbl/d) 10,362 $ 1.45 / gallon 72% Natural gas (MMBtu/d) 44,344 $ 4.13 / MMBtu 73% (a) Hedged with fixed price swaps. Year Ending December 31, 2013 Volumes Hedged (a) Average Price Percentage Hedged NGLs (Bbl/d) 367 $ 2.55 / gallon 2% Condensate (Bbl/d) 649 $ 2.55 / gallon 23% Total (Bbl/d) 1,016 $ 2.55 / gallon 4% Natural gas (MMBtu/d) 50,137 $ 3.85 / MMBtu 75% (a) Hedged with fixed price swaps. 68 Table of Contents ONEOK Partners expects its commodity price risk in its gathering and processing business to increase in the future as volumes increase under POP contracts with our customers. ONEOK Partners commodity price risk is estimated as a hypothetical change in the price of NGLs, crude oil and natural gas, excluding the effects of hedging, and assuming normal operating conditions. ONEOK Partners condensate sales are based on the price of crude oil. ONEOK Partners estimates the following: a $0.01 per gallon change in the composite price of NGLs would change annual net margin by approximately $1.7 million; a $1.00 per barrel change in the price of crude oil would change annual net margin by approximately $1.3 million; and a $0.10 per MMBtu change in the price of natural gas would change annual net margin by approximately $2.2 million. ONEOK Partners is also exposed to location price differential risk primarily as a result of NGLs in storage, the relative values of the various NGL products to each other, the relative value of NGLs to natural gas and the relative value of NGL purchases at one location and sales at another location. ONEOK Partners utilizes fixed price physical forward contracts to reduce earnings volatility related to NGL price fluctuations in the storage and optimization activities of its natural gas liquids business. ONEOK Partners has not entered into any financial instruments with respect to its natural gas liquids businesss marketing activities. In addition, ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk as its natural gas interstate and intrastate pipelines retain natural gas from its customers for operations or as part of its fee for services provided. When the amount of natural gas consumed in operations by these pipelines differs from the amount provided by its customers, the pipelines must buy or sell natural gas, or store or use natural gas from inventory, which exposes ONEOK Partners to commodity price risk. At December 31, 2011, there were no hedges in place with respect to natural gas price risk from ONEOK Partners natural gas pipeline business. Natural Gas Distribution Our Natural Gas Distribution segment uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of anticipated natural gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect its customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural gas. Gains or losses associated with these derivative instruments are included in, and recoverable through, the monthly purchased gas cost adjustment mechanism. Energy Services Our Energy Services segment is exposed to commodity price risk, location risk and price volatility arising from natural gas in storage, peaking natural gas load requirement contracts, asset management contracts and index based purchases and sales of natural gas at various market locations. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk through the use of derivative instruments, which, under certain circumstances, are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. We are also exposed to commodity price risk from fixed price purchases and sales of natural gas, which we hedge with derivative instruments. Both the fixed price purchases and sales and related derivatives are recorded at fair value. Fair Value Component of the Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities The following table sets forth the fair value component of the energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities, excluding $80.7 million and $101.1 million of net assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, from derivative instruments declared as either fair value or cash flow hedges for the periods indicated: Fair Value Component of Energy Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities (Thousands of dollars) Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at January 1, 2010 $ 2,725 Derivatives reclassified or otherwise settled during the period (7,494 ) Fair value of new derivatives entered into during the period 31,817 Other changes in fair value (18,607 ) Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2010 8,441 Derivatives reclassified or otherwise settled during the period (11,378 ) Fair value of new derivatives entered into during the period 70,141 Other changes in fair value (54,595 ) Net fair value of derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2011 (a) $ 12,609 (a) The maturities of derivatives are based on injection and withdrawal periods from April through March, which is consistent with our business strategy. The maturities are as follows: $0.8 million matures through March 2012 and $11.8 million matures through March 2015. 69 Table of Contents The change in the net fair value of derivatives outstanding includes the effect of settled energy contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of market movements on the fair value of energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities. For further discussion of fair value measurements and trading activities and assumptions used in our trading activities, see the Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies section of Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Also, see Notes C and D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. VAR Disclosure of Commodity Price Risk We measure commodity price risk in our Energy Services segment using a VAR methodology, which estimates the expected maximum loss of our portfolio over a specified time horizon within a given confidence interval. Our VAR calculations are based on the Monte Carlo approach. The quantification of commodity price risk using VAR provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance and to determine risk thresholds. The use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions, including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation. Historical data is used to estimate our VAR with more weight given to recent data, which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements. Other assumptions include a distribution of prices and historical data to calculate volatility and price correlations. We rely on VAR to determine the potential reduction in the portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period. While management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable, no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating VAR. Different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different VAR estimates. Our VAR exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized due to adverse commodity price movements in our Energy Services segments portfolio of derivative financial instruments, physical commodity contracts, leased transport, storage capacity contracts and natural gas in storage. A one day time horizon and a 95 percent confidence level are used in our VAR data. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the VAR calculation based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices, operating exposures and timing thereof, and the changes in our derivative financial instruments, physical contracts and natural gas in storage. VAR information should be evaluated in light of these assumptions and the methodologys other limitations. The potential impact on our future earnings, as measured by VAR, was $2.7 million and $2.9 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The following table sets forth the average, high and low VAR calculations for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, Value at Risk 2011 2010 (Millions of dollars) Average $ 3.0 $ 5.5 High $ 6.6 $ 9.6 Low $ 1.2 $ 2.3 Our VAR calculation includes derivatives, executory storage and transportation agreements and their related hedges. The variations in the VAR data are reflective of market volatility and changes in our portfolio during the year. The decrease in average VAR for 2011, compared with 2010, was due primarily to lower average commodity prices and decreased price volatility in 2011. To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably. As a result, we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on our business, operating results or financial position. INTEREST RATE RISK General We are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the normal course of business. We manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps. Fixed rate swaps may be used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates. Floating rate swaps may be used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates. At December 31, 2011, the interest rate on all of ONEOKs and ONEOK Partners long term debt was fixed, and ONEOK and ONEOK Partners had forward starting interest rate swaps that have been designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of interest payments on a portion of a forecasted debt issuance that may result from changes in the benchmark interest rate before the debt is issued. 70 Table of Contents COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK ONEOK and ONEOK Partners assess the creditworthiness of their counterparties on an ongoing basis and require security, including prepayments and other forms of collateral, when appropriate. 71 Table of Contents This page intentionally left blank. 72 Table of Contents
